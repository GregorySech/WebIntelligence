{"title": "Sherlock\u2019s creators are getting in on the monster craze with an adaptation of Dracula", "content": " \nWhen Sherlock first aired on BBC in 2010, it became a global phenomenon, catapulting Benedict Cumberbatch into stardom. According to Variety, the creators of the show are hoping to strike gold once again with another literary classic: Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. \nMark Gatiss and Steven Moffatt are developing a new take on the literary monster. They plan to adopt the same format that they used for Sherlock: very short seasons with extra-long episodes. It\u2019s not clear if Gatiss and Moffatt will set the show in the modern day, or where the show will end up, but talks are reportedly underway with the BBC. \nLike Sherlock Holmes, Dracula is a frequently adapted character: the vampire has been featured in hundreds of films and television shows, such as the 2014 film Dracula Untold, and NBC\u2019s 2013 Victorian-set adaptation Dracula, which lasted for a single season.\nDracula has been adapted hundreds of times, and it\u2019ll be in good company moving forward\nIf this particular project moves forward, it\u2019ll be in good company as Universal Studios ramps up work on its own reboot of classic horror monsters, which kicked off recently with Alex Kurtzman\u2019s The Mummy. That film is set to be followed in 2019 by a remake of Bride of Frankenstein, while the studio is developing remakes of Frankenstein, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man, Van Helsing, Wolf Man, Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and of course, Dracula. Should the BBC end up with the show, it\u2019ll be joined by another literary classic, an adaptation of H.G. Wells\u2019 The War of the Worlds, which is currently in production. \n"}
