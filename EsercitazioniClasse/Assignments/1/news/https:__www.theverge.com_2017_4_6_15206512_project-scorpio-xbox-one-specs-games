{"title": "Project Scorpio focuses Xbox on games \u2014 so where are they?", "content": " \nThe next Xbox is a powerful machine. As Digital Foundry revealed today in a lengthy rundown of specs, Project Scorpio \u2014 the codename for the next Xbox One \u2014 will be both faster and more powerful than its predecessor and its console competitor, capable of running games in native 4K. Even older Xbox One titles will see an improvement, in some cases with smoother performance, improved textures, and the ability to play at a higher resolution. These are all great additions that will surely improve the Xbox experience. But all the talk of better processors and GPUs doesn\u2019t solve the Xbox One\u2019s fundamental issue: it needs more and better games.\nThe reason the PlayStation 4 is handily outselling the Xbox One has little to do with technical specifications. It\u2019s because Sony has curated a formidable lineup of console exclusives and exclusive content for multiplatform games. In 2017 alone, a year already rife with potential game-of-the-year candidates, the PS4 has seen notable titles like Persona 5 and Horizon Zero Dawn that aren\u2019t available on Microsoft\u2019s platform. And it\u2019s a trend that looks to continue: much-anticipated multiplatform game Destiny 2 will feature PlayStation-exclusive content for the first year after it launches. Meanwhile, the comparatively underpowered Nintendo Switch has been riding a wave of goodwill largely on the back of one excellent game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nXbox Project Scorpio: 6 questions left to answer\nHow Project Scorpio makes Xbox One games look better\nMicrosoft reveals its final Xbox Project Scorpio specs\n\n\nMicrosoft currently doesn\u2019t have that advantage. While there are some interesting Xbox One games in the works, including titles like the long-delayed Crackdown 3 and Sea of Thieves, their numbers are small, and there\u2019s nothing that, at this moment, could be considered a system-seller on the level of Breath of the Wild. There\u2019s little reason to believe that a spec bump for Project Scorpio will do much to change that and encourage developers to focus more on Xbox. In fact, a recent survey from the Game Developers Conference suggests that game creators aren\u2019t especially interested in either Scorpio or Sony\u2019s similar PS4 Pro. Only 18 percent of those surveyed thought the new hardware was a good thing for the industry. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t really know what to make of it,\u201d said GDC general manager Meggan Scavio.\nOf course, this only counts the games we know about. An important thing to note is the timing of today\u2019s Scorpio reveal, which is just a few short months ahead of E3 in Los Angeles, where Microsoft has said it will talk more about the console. (Including, presumably, what it will look like and how much it will cost.) It\u2019s possible that Microsoft is getting the nitty-gritty technical details out of the way now so that it can focus on games at E3. Refocusing its efforts on games has been a talking point for the Xbox team ever since the disastrous Xbox One launch, where Forza and Halo took a backseat to partnerships with the NFL and Comcast. It\u2019s something the company has been trying to fix ever since.\nThe changes and upgrades at the heart of Project Scorpio all bear this game-centric focus in mind. They\u2019re features meant to improve the experience of playing Xbox games, whether it\u2019s making them look better, run smoother, or adding features like better GameDVR. This isn\u2019t another attempt to turn the Xbox into the all-encompassing center of your living room entertainment experience. It\u2019s about games \u2014 and now it just needs some new ones.\n"}
