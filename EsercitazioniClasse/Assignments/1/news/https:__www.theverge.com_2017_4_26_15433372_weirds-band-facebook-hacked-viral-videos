{"title": "A UK band got 100,000 new likes on Facebook after hackers turned their page into a viral video dump", "content": " \nFew people would be excited to discover that their Facebook page had morphed into a viral video page overnight, but maybe it would get you some new followers. At least that\u2019s what happened to the UK band Weirds last week. First reported by Noisey, the band\u2019s Facebook page was hacked after they returned from tour, wiped free of their posts, and renamed \u201cTop Viral Videos.\u201d In a post on their since-recovered Facebook page, Weirds said their hacked page featured \u201chundreds of short viral videos every couple of minutes.\u201d\nAfter a week, Weirds were able to regain control of their page, but their old photos and posts are all gone. \u201cThis was obviously devastating to us as a small band using Facebook as our main point of communication,\u201d Weirds wrote. \u201cYears of hard work, graft and memories have unfortunately been wiped away, and are irretrievable.\u201d\n\n\n\nHEY! We\u2019re back online. Thanks for bearing with us. First things first, we\u2019ve just come back from touring with the...Publicado por Weirds em Quarta, 26 de abril de 2017\n\n\nThe only thing Weirds did gain (except maybe a new password?) is more than 100,000 new likes. In their return post, the band points out that the page only had around 3,000 likes before the hack \u2014 now that number is up past 119,000. Weirds are asking anyone who liked the page while it was \u201cTop Viral Videos\u201d to please leave and go to one of the dozens of other pages just like it. \n\u201cSocial media is a huge part of being in a band these days, and believe us, we understand the hard work that goes into running it, building your online presence and seeing your audience grow over time,\u201d Weirds wrote. \u201cWhen that gets taken away, it\u2019s not a nice feeling in the slightest.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that for any small indie band, social media is maybe the easiest way to gauge if your fanbase is growing. And if hundreds of thousands of people are only sticking around to see videos of cats running on a treadmill, it becomes more difficult to track success and speak directly to real fans. But maybe the real fans want viral content, too: two comments on the band\u2019s return post are jokingly asking when more memes are coming.\nWeirds have a new album, Swarmculture, out on May 26th.\n"}
