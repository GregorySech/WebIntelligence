{"title": "Apple has been categorizing all your \u2018brassiere\u2019 photos for over a year now", "content": " \nA tweet by user ellieeewbu today revealed that searching \u201cbrassiere\u201d in the Photos app on iPhones categorizes photos featuring bras automatically into a group. Women have been responding to the tweet posting screenshots with similar results. Most searches show photos of lingerie, bikinis, bare skin, or in some cases, memes. \nShould the fact that \u201cbrassiere\u201d is a category at all be concerning? Or is it more alarming that most people didn\u2019t know that image categorization was a feature at all?\n\n\nATTENTION ALL GIRLS ALL GIRLS!!! Go to your photos and type in the \u2018Brassiere\u2019 why are apple saving these and made it a folder!!?!!?    \u2014 ell (@ellieeewbu) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nImage recognition was introduced with iOS 10 in June 2016, when the Photos app was updated with deep learning for object and scene detection. Apple stressed during the keynote, as well as on its website, that all object detection is done completely locally on the device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Medium post, developer Kenny Yin detailed all of the facial expressions and objects the Photos app recognized, which he found through a few lines of code in the framework of macOS Sierra\u2019s Photos app. At the time it was released, the app was capable of recognizing seven different facial expressions, and a total of 4,432 keywords, \u201cbrassiere\u201d included. You can read the full list here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenny Yin\n\n\nOne thing to note here is that while women\u2019s undergarments like \u201cbra\u201d are listed as categories, there\u2019s no mention of men\u2019s boxers or briefs. Clearly someone had to have made a conscious decision to include (or not include) certain categories. Even \u201ccorset\u201d and \u201cgirdle\u201d are on the list. Where is the same attention to detail for mens\u2019 clothing?\nDespite the fact that this categorization has been around for over a year, there\u2019s something to be said about users just finding out about it now. Considering that machine learning image recognition was hyped as a prominent Google Photos feature since May 2015, I was surprised to find out that the Photos app on my iPhone had the same feature. Most people know about the facial recognition and Memories features on their phones, but based on the reactions from today, it\u2019s likely that many people (myself included) now know just how specific the image categories can get. \nFor the record, Google Photos does the exact same thing when you search \u201cbrassiere,\u201d except your photos are stored on the cloud, in Google\u2019s servers. If anything, this should be the bigger security concern that\u2019s freaking out people on Twitter. \n"}
