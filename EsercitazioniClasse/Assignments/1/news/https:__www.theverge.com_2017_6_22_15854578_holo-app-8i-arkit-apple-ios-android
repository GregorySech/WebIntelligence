{"title": "The Holo app is a tease of what's to come with AR on the iPhone", "content": " \nThe most exciting thing about Apple\u2019s recent announcement of iOS 11 at WWDC, to me, was ARKit. The idea that augmented reality is going to be baked into the mobile operating system means all sorts of weird stuff is on the way this fall. If, like me, you\u2019re anxious to play around with AR, but you also don\u2019t want to burden your iPhone with a buggy developer beta version of iOS 11, a new app called Holo is almost good enough to scratch that itch.\nHolo was created by a VR / AR company called 8i, which we actually profiled back in February. It\u2019s a simple app that lets you place \u201cholograms\u201d \u2014 essentially animated 3D models of people or animals \u2014 in your world using your iPhone\u2019s screen as a viewfinder. There\u2019s a burgeoning \u201cstore\u201d inside the app where you can download different 3D objects, but they\u2019re all either people or animals at the moment. There\u2019s a skateboarder, a dancing wrestler, a few different versions of Spider-Man (sponsored by Marvel, of course), and for those of you clamoring for topical augmented reality, a fake Donald Trump.\n\n  \n  Moose is out of town so I found a new friend A post shared by Sean O'Kane (@sokane1) on Jun 22, 2017 at 7:54am PDT\n\n\n\nBut there are problems with Holo\u2019s simplicity. For one, the objects can\u2019t interact with the world you\u2019re placing them into. The app isn\u2019t recognizing surfaces or mapping the world, it\u2019s just remembering generally where you placed the object so that if you turn away or move around, the hologram stays relatively put. \nThis is fine if you\u2019re placing things in an open area, but it means the app isn\u2019t aware of walls or other things in the real world that might block your view of the object. For instance, I put Spider-Man in my coffee mug, but when I pulled the phone away from the top, he stayed visible. When I placed him in my shower and walked out of the bathroom, he appeared in the hallway when I turned back in that same general direction.\n\nHolo is almost too simple\n\nThis Holo app is so close to, but not quite, what ARkit is going to be like pic.twitter.com/y9uFkiNEhk\u2014 Sean O'Kane (@sokane1) June 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\nAnother frustrating side effect of Holo\u2019s simplicity is that the app is sparse, almost too much so. There are buttons at the bottom for recording a video and taking a photo, but to get to the tray of holograms, you have to swipe up over that same area. When the tray of holograms \u2014 which is laid out in a row of circles like Snapchat\u2019s lenses \u2014 is there, you swipe up to see the hologram \u201cstore\u201d or down to bring the camera controls back. It\u2019s just confusing to have all these controls competing against each other in the same spot.\nAll this said, if you use it right and work around these limitations, Holo can be fun. The struggles are almost worth it for the times where the AR looks just right, because those moments can still wow you (and others) a bit. And to be fair, 8i already built a version of Holo for Tango, Google\u2019s AR platform, so there\u2019s a good chance the experience will improve when ARKit goes live. \nReally though, this is all just a tease for what\u2019s to come with augmented reality on iOS 11. And while developers have already been experimenting with some wild ideas using ARKit that put 8i\u2019s version here to shame, I do believe the Holo app is a pretty good blueprint for what most consumers\u2019 initial experience with augmented reality will look like on iOS 11: an app with a camera-style interface that has its own \u201cstore\u201d full of 3D models, objects, and effects. \nHolo is available today for free on both iOS and Android.\n\n"}
