{"title": "Sony\u2019s giant, $700 e-paper tablet is a great example of Weird Sony", "content": " \nFor years, science fiction has promised that one day, technology will make paper obsolete. Instead of carrying around folders of dead trees and bulky books, we\u2019ll use miraculous tablets instead that can store a limitless amount of information and knowledge in a single, easy-to-carry form factor. This is the idea that\u2019s driving Sony\u2019s newest digital paper tablet, the DPT-RP1. \nSony has actually been trying to put paper out of business for a while. While Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-readers may be the household name these days, it was Sony\u2019s Librie that pioneered the use of an E Ink display for reading. (The DPT-RP1 itself is an updated version of Sony\u2019s original digital paper effort, the DPT-S1.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DPT-RP1 offers a similar 13.3-inch display as its predecessor, but dramatically improves the resolution from 1200 x 1600 dots to 1650 x 2200 dots. The screen is a \u201cnon-slip\u201d panel, which the company says will improve the experience of annotating documents with the included digital pen. The new design is also thinner, lighter, and faster than the previous version; Sony notes that the entire device is roughly as thick as a stack of 30 pages of paper. \nSony developed a new Digital Paper App for desktop to make it easier to convert websites and documents to PDF form and send them wirelessly to the DPT-RP1. The DPT-RP1 still only works with PDF files, so you won\u2019t be able to use it to replace your Kindle anytime soon, but it\u2019s something that makes sense given that Sony is still positioning the DPT-RP1 for businesses, lawyers, and university researchers who are looking to cut down on their paper use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the time between Sony\u2019s original DPT-S1 and now, the company has also picked up some competition in the form of the reMarkable, a similar giant E Ink tablet that was announced last year that also aims to replace paper with a giant E Ink display. That said, the DPT-RP1 \u2014 backed by Sony\u2019s actual experience in shipping products \u2014 will be a real product that, barring any commercial calamities, you\u2019ll be able to buy, which the startup reMarkable can\u2019t quite claim. \nOne thing the DPT-RP1 shares in common with the original DPT-S1 is a huge price \u2014 the new model is expected to go on sale in Japan for around 80,000 yen (roughly $719) on June 5th. While Sony is focusing on direct commercial sales for the DPT-RP1, individual customers looking to buy one will be able to do so at a Sony retail store. \n"}
