{"title": "LinkedIn\u2019s latest millennial bait is a Tinder-style mentorship service", "content": " \nIn its never-ending quest to connect you with other working professionals whom you will never again make contact with, LinkedIn\u2019s product team has released some real head-scratchers in its storied, 14-year history. From the Microsoft-owned company\u2019s recent Facebook-style news feed implementation to the long-standing encouragement that complete and total strangers \u201cconnect\u201d as a way to inflate one\u2019s networking skills, LinkedIn has become this kind of bizarro social network that everyone outside of corporate recruiters feels compelled to use as sparingly as humanely possible, or only with complete and unfailing irony. (For fun, take a minute and endorse your friends for skills they don\u2019t have, like Sports Nutrition and Military Weapons Handling.)\nLinkedIn\u2019s Tinder-style mentor feature lets you seek advice from a list of faces\nThat makes the latest addition to LinkedIn\u2019s list of hip, millennial-loving \u201csocial\u201d features that have little place on a networking site that much more puzzling. The company announced today that it would be introducing what TechCrunch describes as a \u201cTinder-style\u201d feature for pairing mentors with those looking for professional advice. LinkedIn reportedly launched the feature originally in beta last month, and it\u2019s since brought the full version of the feature to its main service. \nLike Tinder, you can specify that certain criteria requirements must be met before you\u2019re paired with a potential mentor or mentee, including where a person falls in your network (like a first- or second-degree connection, for instance) and other factors to narrow down the list to a potential list of suitable lifehack-loving thinkfluencers. From there, you\u2019re able to pair up and start chatting. You don\u2019t appear to have to swipe on people\u2019s faces, though of course that\u2019s because a swipe mechanic would probably run the risk of making LinkedIn\u2019s feature look more like... well, a dating app. You do, however, cycle through a list of algorithmically generated faces and profiles designed to meet your highly specific needs and diminish the human spirit. \nIf it sounds like a lot like a toothless attempt at winning over younger users with a design method borrowed from the soulless dating app paradigm of our time, you would be quite correct. Most mentorships in life arise from natural occurrences with bosses or colleagues or people who, over time, organically take on the role of someone who\u2019s looking after your career because they believe in you and think you\u2019re talented. LinkedIn, like a number of other venture-backed \u201ccoaching\u201d services that are trying to commodify good advice, wants you to skip right to the awkward and unpleasant moment when you and another person must own up to the shallow, transactional nature of your relationship. And what better way to do so than by initially judging them at a glance based only on what your brain can glean from 10 seconds of looking at their face and highest-listed credential?\n"}
