{"title": "A modder turned a MacBook Pro into a Samsung DeX laptop", "content": " \nIt\u2019s not the nicest laptop out there, but this modded 2008 MacBook Pro is definitely the nicest laptop running DeX \u2014 Samsung\u2019s portable desktop software, which isn\u2019t actually meant to be built into a laptop.\nAs spotted by SamMobile, a modder named Kris Henriksen (who also appears to be the co-founder of a Bitcoin payments startup) cracked open an old MacBook and replaced some of its internals with parts that allow it to run DeX off of a phone. Henriksen replaced the laptop\u2019s battery, installed a new LCD controller, and made the keyboard and trackpad work over USB. All of that \u2014 and some other tweaks, like getting the laptop\u2019s fan to work \u2014 allowed him to plug in a Galaxy S8 and boot into DeX.\nSamsung really ought to make a laptop dock\nThe whole thing appears to work pretty well, with the only oddity being the phone that\u2019s powering the laptop being attached to the side of the screen. I suppose, though, that building the phone into the laptop would have wasted a perfectly good smartphone.\n\nNew Samsung DeX Laptop\n\n\nSamsung\u2019s DeX software lets Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, and Note 8 owners plug their phone into a monitor and have it boot into a desktop environment. It looks just as you\u2019d expect a desktop computer to look, though the platform still has an extremely limited number of apps. DeX is based off of Android, and Samsung has started to get some Android apps \u2014 including Lightroom, Spotify, and Word \u2014 optimized for the bigger display.\nMy colleague Dan Seifert was really impressed with what DeX was capable of when he reviewed it earlier this year. Even though there were issues with apps and mode switching, he said, \u201cI\u2019m stunned at how close Samsung has come to fulfilling the dream of having one device that can work as multiple types of computers.\u201d\nSo while DeX isn\u2019t the best desktop experience, it\u2019s definitely workable. And since there\u2019s no portable solution for it yet, Henriksen\u2019s creation is the best (and only) option for someone who wants to turn their phone into a desktop on the go. Perhaps Samsung should take this as a sign that it\u2019s time to make a real laptop dock.\n"}
