{"title": "Inside Walt Mossberg\u2019s gadget museum", "content": " \nWalt Mossberg is retiring this year \u2014 he\u2019s already written his last column, hosted his last Code Conference, and taped the final episode of Ctrl-Walt-Delete in front of a live audience in New York. But Walt\u2019s also assembled an impressive collection of notable gadgets over his two-decade run as a reviewer and columnist, and we asked him to talk us through some of the more notable items as he cleared out of his office. \nThis isn\u2019t everything \u2014 there\u2019s far too much for that. But there\u2019s nothing quite like Walt talking about gadgets and what they mean, and we tried to pick a few that defined their moments in a way few products now seem to do.\nIt\u2019s been incredible having Walt on The Verge team, and we\u2019re all going to miss his insight, wit, enthusiasm, and charm. I hope you enjoy this look at him doing what he does best: explaining technology to people who love it just as much as he does.\n\u2014Nilay Patel\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMAZON KINDLE\n2007, $399\nAmazon announced the first Kindle in November 2007, the same year Apple released the first iPhone. But the $399 gadget was from a different planet in terms of design, with a chunky asymmetric case, angled hard plastic keyboard, and a reflective hardware scroll display with a dedicated wheel. \u201cIf someone had put this on Steve Jobs\u2019 desk, they\u2019d be fired,\u201d says Mossberg. But the Kindle set off an e-reading revolution \u2014 modern Kindles start at just $79, with everything from the first design but the E Ink screen stripped away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRADIO SHACK TRS-80 MODEL 100\n1977, $600\nThe Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100 \u2014 or Trash 80, as it was affectionately called \u2014 was one of the first laptops. Or first tablets, if you squint. It ran on four AA batteries, and it was routinely given to journalists in the field because it had a built-in modem that could send files back to the office through an acoustic coupler for a landline phone handset. Mossberg used his TRS-80 all over the world as a reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal; as a deputy bureau chief he bought one for every reporter in the bureau. \u201cI honestly think you could draw a line from this to the iPad,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOTOROLA STARTAC\n1996, $1,000\nThe Motorola StarTac was arguably the first mobile phone that was also a fashion and cultural icon. The small size and flip design inspired by Star Trek made it an object of desire, and it popped up in movies and TV shows for years. It wasn\u2019t a smartphone \u2014 it just made calls. \u201cCarrying this made you cool,\u201d says Mossberg. Flip phones might have all but gone away, but the StarTac lives forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM THINKPAD 701\n1995, $5,000\nThe ThinkPad 701 is one of the most iconic laptop designs in history \u2014 so much so that it\u2019s sitting in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. To accommodate a full-size keyboard, IBM\u2019s designers developed an ingenious \u201cbutterfly\u201d folding mechanism that folded the deck into the case when the lid was closed, and expanded it when the hinge was opened. \u201cThis solved a very important problem that people in the early days of laptops that people had.\u201d A few years later, the advent of larger screens meant that full-size keyboards fit well under the screen, and the butterfly keyboard was retired. But it\u2019s still a marvel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPLE IPHONE\n2007, $599\nWhat else is there to say about the iPhone? Apple\u2019s touchscreen wonder changed the course of technology and culture, setting off the mobile revolution. \u201cSmartphones are the new personal computer,\u201d says Mossberg. A decade later, Apple is among the most valuable companies on the planet, and the iPhone is 70 percent of its business. And now we\u2019re all waiting for the 10th anniversary iPhone to blow us all away once again.\n\n\n\n\n"}
