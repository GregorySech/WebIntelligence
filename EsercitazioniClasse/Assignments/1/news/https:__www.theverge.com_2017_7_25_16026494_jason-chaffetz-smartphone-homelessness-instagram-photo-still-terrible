{"title": "Former Congressman Jason Chaffetz still can\u2019t stand poor people with smartphones", "content": " \nJason Chaffetz, who stepped down from his Utah seat in the House of Representatives last month, still absolutely hates the idea of non-wealthy Americans having smartphones. Today, the former Republican lawmaker posted an Instagram photo of an apparently homeless person near Times Square, snidely noting that the person was \u201cstreaming video on a phone.\u201d\nThe last time we checked in on Chaffetz, he was suggesting that people show \u201cself-reliance\u201d by buying health insurance instead of \u201cthat new iPhone that they just love,\u201d using the popular smartphone as an example of a pointlessly frivolous purchase. (Incidentally, this involved an egregious misjudgment of how much health care costs, albeit one that\u2019s still closer than Donald Trump\u2019s latest guess.)\nWe can\u2019t be sure whether today\u2019s photo features some fancy $700 iPhone or a sub-$100 budget Android phone, and Chaffetz declined to elaborate. At the high end, maybe its owner could trade it for a single month in a windowless Queens basement, or perhaps a precisely bed-sized Brooklyn dorm, as long as they\u2019ve got a second iPhone for the security deposit. (New York\u2019s homeless population is currently at an all-time high of over 60,000 people, including around 23,000 children and many working adults, thanks to its dystopian housing market.)\nWe obviously don\u2019t know anything about Chaffetz\u2019s subject, whose face thankfully isn\u2019t in the photo. And you can\u2019t pin the blame for New York\u2019s homelessness problem on one political party, although Trump\u2019s projected public housing budget cuts would certainly make things worse. But it\u2019s embarrassing to see someone once lauded as a \u201ctech-savvy\u201d politician seem bemused that technology and economics have intersected to produce something more complicated than ragged hobos staring into a burning barrel. Chaffetz may no longer be in Congress, but unfortunately, his new Fox News gig will probably still give his terrible opinions more heft than they deserve.\n"}
