{"title": "Airbnb will now let users leave reviews even if they don\u2019t complete their entire stay", "content": " \nToday, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority announced a change is coming to Airbnb that will allow users to leave an online review even if they haven\u2019t completed their full stay. Previously, these types of reviews could only be left with the assistance of Airbnb\u2019s customer services department.\nThere are numerous reasons why someone might leave a property early \u2014 if a listing is run down and doesn\u2019t meet the expectations presented online, for example, or if a host\u2019s behavior makes the guest feel uncomfortable or unsafe. And now guests can easily give others a heads up on why they left without any extra barriers.\nThe change comes in response to enquiries by the CMA, which acts as the UK\u2019s primary consumer authority, after it became aware that people who chose not to stay at a property when they arrived had no way to leave a review through Airbnb\u2019s standard system. Airbnb has committed to implement the change worldwide by August 31st of this year.\n"}
