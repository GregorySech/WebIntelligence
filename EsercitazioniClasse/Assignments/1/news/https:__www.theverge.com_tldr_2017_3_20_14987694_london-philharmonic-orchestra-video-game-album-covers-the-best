{"title": "These orchestral video game album covers may be the greatest achievement in visual arts", "content": " \nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra is an incredibly respected musical group, known around the world for both its renditions of classical music and for its work in providing the instrumentation for numerous film scores, including Lawrence of Arabia, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jesus Christ Superstar.\nBut all of that work pales in comparison to the album artwork for the London Phiharmonic\u2019s video game music compilations, The Greatest Video Game Music and the sequel, the aptly named The Greatest Video Game Music 2. Recently discovered by Twitter user @sparkletone, the half-decade-old album covers are like priceless antiquities. \n\n\nThis is the most amazing album art I've seen in a minute pic.twitter.com/kB9xoV2lN0\u2014 sparkletone (@sparkletone) March 20, 2017\n\n\n\nThe first appears to be \u201cinspired\u201d by the Battlefield series of games, depicting a grim solider in gray with a bright orange highlight wielding not an instrument of death but rather one of music, in what I assume to be some sort of poetic statement on the horrors of war and the beauty of life. It is the perfect visualization of soaring, classically stylized rendition of the Battlefield 2: Theme contained on the album. \n\n\nOH MY GOD THERE'S MORE THAN ONE     pic.twitter.com/DA8S5JI0Ya\u2014 sparkletone (@sparkletone) March 20, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Greatest Video Game Music 2 cover follows in a similar vein, seemingly borrowing the aesthetic of 2012\u2019s Spec-Ops: The Line, as a solider marches back from war, tanks and explosions in the background, violin in hand. \nAs my colleague Chris Plante remarks, the covers on display here are \u201cthe marriage of beautiful art and bros killing fools,\u201d a statement that, much like the musical contents of these albums, truly encompasses the entire scope of the video gaming industry and its perception as an art form. \n"}
