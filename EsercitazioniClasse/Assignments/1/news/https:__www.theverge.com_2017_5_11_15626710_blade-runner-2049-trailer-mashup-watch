{"title": "This Blade Runner 2049 trailer mash-up shows how much the new film respects the original", "content": " \nIMDb has put together a video that runs the latest trailer from Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Blade Runner 2049 alongside scenes from Ridley Scott\u2019s original film, showing that sequel is borrowing not only from the design and feel of the world, but its visuals as well. \nOur first glimpses of the film have seen a world that looks incredibly familiar, from the moody dystopian atmosphere and haunting music, but IMDb\u2019s mash-up shows that the attention to detail lines up visually, too. The positioning of the actors, as well as the camera\u2019s motion, framing, and even its height seems to be a careful reconstruction of the original film, showing that the film\u2019s creators are careful to replicate more than just the atmosphere and visual trappings of the world.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nBlade Runner 2049 looks like a careful extension of Ridley Scott\u2019s vision\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a movie with as great a visual legacy as Blade Runner, and Villeneuve\u2019s sequel will have much to live up to when it hits theaters later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop: Blade Runner 2049, \u201cWallace\u201d lit from the top. Bottom: Original Blade Runner, Tyrell lit with bounced light reflected off water.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely a copy, however. The Verge\u2019s creative director James Bareham says that one thing he noticed is \u201cthat Ridley Scott\u2019s cinematographer, Jordan Cronenweth, bounced light off water to get the shimmering effect in Tyrell's apartment in the original film. The lighting in the new Blade Runner seems to be softer, brighter, and more constant. There's more flickering, blinking neon in the original.\u201d It\u2019ll be interesting to see just how well Villeneuve\u2019s film stacks up against Scott\u2019s, and if it\u2019ll have the same impact on filmmakers. \nBlade Runner 2049 hits theaters on October 6th, 2017.\n"}
