{"title": "My spirit lives in this Twitter account of Italians pissed off at bad food recipes", "content": " \nI might sound stereotypical as hell here, but I\u2019m Italian and I care a lot about food. I also think Italian food is the best food in the world, and I get mad if you bastardize Italian dishes with ingredients that have nothing to do with it. Like, why would you create a burger pizza? (I ate it, with pickles and all, and no, it had no reason to be.)\nThat\u2019s why I was delighted when a friend (also Italian) pointed me to the Twitter account Italians Mad at Food. It\u2019s a fantastic collection of comments by Italians watching video recipes of Italian dishes \u2014 and getting pissed off, really pissed off, the Italian way. Here are some examples:\n\n\npic.twitter.com/jRbmwkMRvT\u2014 italians mad at food (@ItalianComments) May 15, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/KNEukMFKxo\u2014 italians mad at food (@ItalianComments) May 9, 2017\n\n\n\nI just love how passionate these people are. I feel their pain, their indignation, and seeing their comments pop up in my news feed always gives me a smile. So I decided to reach out to the person behind this, who tweets from the account @prodigis. To my surprise, the genius who created Italians Mad at Food is not Italian at all. His name is Zach Champion, a 25-year-old electronic music producer and writer who lives in Michigan.\nWe talked about how Italians Mad at Food came to be, how he runs it, and how the account is going to change in the future.\nThe interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nWhen and why did you start Italians Mad at Food?\nI started it back in December. I was sucked up as much as anyone else in this pretty rapidly accelerating trend of sped-up, gimmicky recipe videos on Facebook, like Tasty and Tastemade, that just seemed to come out of nowhere and then they were everywhere. Gradually, I just started noticing that any time they\u2019d post pasta or pizza recipes, they\u2019d get this unrelenting torrent of vitriol from sometimes the same people commenting on every video \u2014 this pretty broad swath of very traditionalist Italian cooks and consumers. \nSo on my personal Twitter account, I started tweeting a couple of those and they didn\u2019t really stick, but somehow I knew that this is hilarious. I read them to my friends sometimes and they agreed that it was hilarious. Even though my personal account didn\u2019t get much traction, I had a gut feeling that there was a market out there for people who would enjoy this. So kind of embracing the more absurdist humor that I liked from elsewhere on Twitter, I put together the image one day and I found that picture of Luigi angrily cooking the pizza. I\u2019m pretty impressed by how easily it came together as a concept. It was especially enticing to me because it\u2019d be such an easy account to run. I can just let these people speak for themselves. \n\n\npic.twitter.com/SK5OkbVPOQ\u2014 italians mad at food (@ItalianComments) March 1, 2017\n\n\n\nYou only follow two Twitter accounts: Tasty and Tastemade. Why is that?\nI wanted to keep the account as stripped down of personality as possible \u2014 the channel by which I can give people these funny reactions. The account often has a voice because I interject my own comments on things at times. It\u2019s mostly just an effort to keep it as focused on the comments as possible. It is an account dedicated to watching Tasty and Tastemade, and seeing when people get mad at them. \nThe account is pretty active, which is why I think it\u2019s successful. How do you go about finding these comments?\nOh gosh, I have sat for probably an unhealthy number of hours, I\u2019ve pretty much watched or at least read the comments of every recipe video that talks about pasta or pizza or any other traditional Italian dish, from the beginning of 2016 / late 2015 on to the present at least. I just dedicated an afternoon to go check that I didn\u2019t miss any funny accounts that are getting yelled at. Tasty and Tastemade alone have enough, honestly. I\u2019ve got like 780 screenshots saved in a folder that are waiting to go up. I\u2019m pretty much set for two years.\n780 screenshots? I didn\u2019t know Italians were that passionate.\nYeah. There are so many of them. They're very passionate. And you know, you\u2019ll have one person make a top-level comment and then 90 people will get into this huge argument. You start breaking into that and content is endless. So I go in in bulk and just watch as many videos I can find. I don\u2019t ever repost, not on purpose anyway. I schedule them out two months in advance, so I don\u2019t have to think about them. I check the notifications every day, just because I love that. People have such great reactions.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/9KlMjCdEqI\u2014 italians mad at food (@ItalianComments) February 12, 2017\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the feedback been?\nI\u2019ve been shocked really by the demographic variety. I have a huge following in Brazil that I never expected. So I get a lot of responses in Portuguese that I can read poorly translated interpretations of. It\u2019s an even split between either folks from Italy or of Italian descent who relate heavily. I get a lot of, \u201cthis is me.\u201d Some people [complain about] national stereotyping, which was not my intent. But I\u2019d say the vast bulk of it is pretty positive.\nI think people are just fascinated mostly by the ability of a lot of the commenters who are clearly writing with English as a second language to get their point across with extremely specific and concise insults. Even if some of the grammar and the vocabulary trips them up along delivery, the ultimate message of why exactly the dish sucks and why that person really needs to rethink their decision is always just so colorful. The most successful posts are usually the ones that are a bit outside of the norm, where it\u2019s not just \u201cmy eyes are bleeding,\u201d \u201cmy grandmother would die if she saw this.\u201d Those are nice but it\u2019s the ones where people go the extra mile to really get underneath the recipe skin. \nWhy do you think Italians are so passionate about it?\nWell, in their own words, and I\u2019ve come to agree on this with a lot of them, their cuisine is very much a part of their national identity. And places like America, while sure we have some sort of quasi-original cuisine, mostly we are an amalgamation of immigrant cuisines and regional classics and things like that. They raise the point a lot that somebody from a country like America \u2014 [where people] don\u2019t have a heritage connection to what they eat, where it\u2019s just what they need to live off of or what they think tastes best, where they can try a totally different classification of food every day if they wanted to \u2014 can\u2019t really understand what it\u2019s like to see all of a sudden in the age of the internet that the rest of the world has been cooking your food slightly differently every time until it becomes completely unrecognizable. \n\n\npic.twitter.com/6zuNo68Pnv\u2014 italians mad at food (@ItalianComments) March 7, 2017\n\n\n\nHave you ever been contacted by people who complained that you tweeted their comments?\nNo, I never had anyone reach out in a negative way. I had one woman, she just responded to a tweet that was of her and said, \u201chey, that\u2019s me!\u201d I was nervous about it at first because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was too invasive. But then it kind of occurred to me that all of the comments I\u2019m screenshotting are on public pages, and they\u2019re usually the top-voted ones way at the top of the comment section. I mean, if anybody reached out to me and asked me to take it down, I would do so. I\u2019ve kind of worked past that moral quandary for the moment on that justification.\nWhat are your plans for the future of the account?\nThe current model of the account \u2014 just tweet out a couple screenshots every day \u2014 will continue for the foreseeable future until it stops being funny and nobody wants to pay attention to it anymore. But I want to tie in a bit of myself to the account intermittently. I mentioned that I make music and that\u2019s something that I want to try to boost the visibility of. I might put together some sort of compilation \u2014 a 20-second-long best of the month, with original soundtrack. But things like that hopefully won\u2019t subtract from the overall ethos of the account, but just give a more direct link to my own personal projects and my own personal account. It\u2019s not without motive. I do this because it\u2019s fun and I think these comments are hilarious and I\u2019m glad that it resonated and people are having fun with it, but I am also still kind of an opportunist. I cannot deny it.\n"}
