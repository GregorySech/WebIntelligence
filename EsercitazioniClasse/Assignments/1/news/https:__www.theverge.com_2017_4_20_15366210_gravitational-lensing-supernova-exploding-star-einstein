{"title": "The light of this distant supernova was warped and split in four ways by a passing galaxy", "content": " \nThe explosive death of a star is an incredible event, but not an unusual one for astronomers to observe. But now, for the first time, scientists have spotted a star\u2019s death \u2014 known as a supernova \u2014 in an unprecedented way: the light from a distant explosion was warped on its way to Earth by a galaxy that got in the way. This warping magnified the supernova\u2019s light and even split the explosion into four different images. It\u2019s a unique find that could tell us more about the structure of our Universe.\nWhat the astronomers observed is known as \u201cgravitational lensing,\u201d and it was predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. The idea is that massive objects curve space and time around them, and these curvatures in space-time can affect the paths on which light travels. Light passing by a particularly massive object, for instance, will not follow a straight path but a warped one. In the case of this supernova, its light encountered a galaxy that acted like an optical lens would on Earth \u2014 focusing the light and splitting it in four different ways.\nWhat the astronomers observed is known as \u201cgravitational lensing\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time that a supernova\u2019s light has been warped by gravitational lensing before. In fact, astronomers also saw an exploding star split four different ways in 2014. But that supernova was lensed by a cluster of galaxies. This one, detailed today in the journal Science, was lensed by just one galaxy \u2014 something that\u2019s never been seen before. And it\u2019s the first time a supernova of this kind, known as a \u201cstandard candle,\u201d has been warped like this.\nAll these unique traits make the discovery extra exciting for astronomers, since the four supernova images can be used to learn more about our expanding Universe. Experts agree that the Universe is growing, but exactly how fast that\u2019s happening is still up for debate. Studying this warped supernova more closely could provide a more definitive answer of that expansion rate. \u201cThis is a new tool that we hadn\u2019t thought we had,\u201d Ariel Goobar, a cosmologist at the University of Stockholm and the lead author of the study, tells The Verge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palomar 48-inch telescope\nScott Kardel/Palomar Observatory\n\n\nGravitational lensing has been used before to learn more about the cosmos \u2014 to better understand dark matter, for instance. This mysterious type of material is thought to make up about 27 percent of our Universe, but it can\u2019t be seen directly. So the only way to study dark matter is to observe how it warps the space-time around it. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at dark matter itself, but the effects of dark matter,\u201d Liliya Williams, a gravitational lensing expert at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the study, tells The Verge.\n\u201cThat immediately made me think that this was something special.\u201d\nTo use gravitational lensing to study supernovae, though, things have to line up just right. Goobar and his team stumbled upon this fortuitous event in September 2016, while searching for star explosions with the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory telescope in California. They found a lot of supernovae in the sky, but one particular star caught Goobar\u2019s attention. He studied the supernova\u2019s light a little more closely and found that this star was much farther away than any of the others they had seen. \u201cThat immediately made me think that this was something special,\u201d says Goobar. \u201cWe were looking for supernovae, but we were never looking for supernovae that far.\u201d\nThe team then realized that there was a galaxy next to the distant supernova, and that the galaxy was pretty much halfway between Earth and the exploding star. That\u2019s when it clicked: the galaxy had magnified the light of the supernova, making it 50 times brighter than normal and easier to spot from Earth. When the astronomers studied the event with other instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, they found that the supernova had been multiplied by the galaxy into four separate images. That happened because the galaxy is shaped in such a way that it creates four different paths in space-time the light can take, Goobar says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomed in images of the supernova\nJoel Johansson\n\n\nThe discovery was made extra special by the fact that this exploding star is a \u201cstandard candle\u201d supernova. These supernovae explode in very predictable ways, with the same level of brightness. By knowing how luminous this star would have been without the lensing effect, Goobar and his team were able to measure very precisely just how much the galaxy magnified the supernova\u2019s light. In turn, that gives them a good idea of what the galaxy is made of and how its matter is distributed.\n\u201cWe know how to look for more.\u201d\nIn addition to all that, this particular type of supernova will also allow the astronomers to figure out how fast the Universe is expanding. The astronomers can measure how long it takes for the light from each of the four images to arrive at Earth. And comparing these arrival times can be used to figure out the expansion rate.\nAs exciting as that is, those measurements may not fully settle the debate over the growth of the Universe. But the good news is there will probably be more opportunities like this in the future. This discovery tells astronomers how to look for similar warped supernovae, Goobar says. And the more they find, the closer we\u2019ll get to understanding just how fast the cosmos is growing. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough in the methodology \u2014 we know how to look for more,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd with a bit of luck and patience, we\u2019ll be able to have answers in the next few years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
