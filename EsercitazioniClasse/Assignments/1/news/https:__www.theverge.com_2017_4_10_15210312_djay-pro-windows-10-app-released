{"title": "Djay Pro arrives on Windows with streaming from Spotify", "content": " \nAfter a decade on the Mac, Djay has come to Windows.\nThe Windows 10 incarnation of Algoriddim\u2019s powerful but easy-to-use DJing app is pretty much identical to what it\u2019s like on macOS: it lets DJs control up to four tracks of audio, manipulate two videos at a time, connect to a selection of DJ controllers, and pull in any song they want from Spotify (so long as they\u2019re a subscriber).\nThere aren\u2019t many changes here aside from some minor visual tweaks to make the app better fit in on Windows. Although, on the off chance that you want to DJ on a Surface Studio, Algoriddim has added controls for the Surface Dial.\nYou can DJ with the Surface Dial on a 28-inch screen, if you really want\nIn a neat touch, those controls actually change depending on where the Dial is placed on-screen: place it on top of a deck, and it can be used to scratch; place it on the music library, and it can scroll through your catalog. It\u2019s a cool trick, though DJing probably isn\u2019t what most Surface Studios are getting used for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Algoriddim\n\n\nThe real question is how big of an audience awaits Algoriddim on Windows. Professional DJs tend to use Macs. And just like on the Mac, Algoriddim will face competition from Serato DJ and Traktor Pro, two popular apps with pros. Though Djay\u2019s Spotify integration could help it stand out.\nFor now, Algoriddim says it\u2019s reached 1 million monthly active users across all of its existing Djay apps, which are also on iOS, watchOS, and Android. Christoph Teschner, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, says that it took about a year to develop the Windows version of the app and that the build time was dramatically shortened thanks to Microsoft\u2019s Bridge tool, which assists developers in porting iOS apps to Windows 10.\nDjay Pro is available through the Windows Store and will be regularly priced at $49.99, the same thing it sells for on macOS.\n"}
