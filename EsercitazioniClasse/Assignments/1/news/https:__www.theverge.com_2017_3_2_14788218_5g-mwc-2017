{"title": "5G: Super fast data, throttled by reality", "content": " \nAt Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, the concept of 5G feels almost like a cult. Everywhere you look, companies are talking about the \u201ctransformative power\u201d of a technology that hasn\u2019t even been standardized yet. Industry reps preach about 5G\u2019s greatness; booths are dedicated to showcasing its miracles; and visitors attend talks with titles like \u201cThe Future of All Things and The Creation of Time.\u201d Mobile data has never felt so religious.\n5G will be faster and more reliable \u2014 when it gets here\nIt would be easy to dismiss all this as hype, but that\u2019s not entirely fair: 5G will genuinely be transformative \u2014 when it finally gets here. Although a full technical standard has yet to be settled, industry bodies have published general benchmarks for the new technology. They cite download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second (that would be 1,000 times faster than the current US 4G average); latency of less than a millisecond; and support for a million connected devices per square kilometer. These specs won\u2019t just let you download a full movie on your phone in seconds, but will also enable all sorts of services that need reliable, high-bandwidth data to work \u2014 everything from remote-control surgical robots to live-streaming VR footage.\nRead more: What is 5G anyway? A technical explainer\n\nBut the problem we\u2019re seeing at MWC, is that people are getting excited about the potential of 5G, but overlooking the immediate reality. Dan Bieler, a telecoms analyst with Forrester, told The Verge that hype surrounding the technology has \u201cpicked up noticeably compared with MWC 2016.\u201d\nJournalists\u2019 inboxes have been bombarded with news of 5G trials and prototype hardware from pretty much every big tech company around. Samsung, AT&T, Ericsson, Verizon, Nokia, Sprint, Qualcomm, have all had news to share, just to name a few. But while these firms are making genuine steps forward with 5G, some of the language might make you think the technology is right on the cusp of being widely available. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5G will be used for tasks like controlling robots.\nPhoto by David Ramos / Getty Images\n\n\nTake Samsung\u2019s announcement of a 5G \u201chome router\u201d for instance. For the uninformed, this might sound like something you can buy to start getting 5G beamed straight in to your house. (The idea is that the speeds of 5G will make wired internet connections irrelevant \u2014 saving on the infrastructure costs of digging cables.) In reality, this router is a \u201cpre-commercial\u201d product that will be used in Samsung\u2019s upcoming 5G trials in the US and UK. And, like other trials announced at MWC, they\u2019re relatively small (in Verizon\u2019s tests, for example, there\u2019ll be around 500 participants) with no guarantee that the tech used for them will become part of the final 5G standard. \nSamsung isn\u2019t being deceptive here, but some firms at MWC were genuinely misleading. ZTE, for example, claimed they would have \u201cthe world\u2019s first gigabit phone\u201d at the show, capable of handling cellular speeds of up to a gigabit. What they actually had was a phone-sized display hooked up to a speed test app, with a connection based on \u201ccarrier aggregation\u201d \u2014 bundling together a bunch of 4G signals to increase the bandwidth. So: not really a phone and not really 5G.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE\u2019s proof-of-concept \u201c5G phone.\u201d\nPhoto by ZTE\n\n\n\u201cI feel that the 5G marketing component is outweighing the business use case,\u201d says Bieler. He says that while vendors have certainly been showing off their \u201ctechnological prowess\u201d at MWC, everything we\u2019ve seen so far is preliminary and provisional. \u201cThe 5G standard is still emerging. Expect an evolution \u2014 not a big bang revolution. Hence, while some technologies will be used, others will be replaced by better technology.\u201d\n\u201c2019 is a very realistic date.\u201d\nSo if we haven\u2019t got 5G now, when will we get it? Estimates vary, but companies are now talking about 2019 and 2020 as possible dates. Samsung\u2019s vice president of networks strategy, Alok Shah, told The Verge that standards for the technology would probably be settled by \u201cearly 2018.\u201d Shah said it was \u201camazing how quickly things are moving\u201d and that \u201c2019 is a very realistic date to see expanded use cases\u201d of 5G. \nOthers think this is still too ambitious a schedule, and point out that historically speaking, even after new cellular tech has been standardized, there\u2019s always a significant delay before it reaches a large number of users. \u201c4G was launched in 2003/2004 and we reached the 1 billion 4G connections last year according to [trade body] GSMA,\u201d Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told The Verge. At MWC this year, GSMA forecasted that there would be 1 billion 5G connections by 2025. \u201cThat's great,\u201d said Husson, \u201cbut that's in eight years, and out of a population of more than 7 billion people, which confirms my take that it won't reach critical mass anytime soon.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5G would let you easily live-stream 360-degree HD video for virtual reality.\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\n\nOthers in the industry say there\u2019s still plenty of capacity to be squeezed out of 4G and LTE, which is currently being pushed up to gigabit speeds.\u201c5G is not ready yet,\u201d T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray told MWC attendees. \u201cIt\u2019s maturing quickly, but it\u2019s not real today.\u201d Ray dismissed some of the 5G trials announced at MWC as \u201cfringe\u201d use cases, and said carriers should focus on technology that\u2019s available right now. \u201cLTE is where we really learn our trade and really build all the foundation blocks that are necessary for a 5G future.\u201d \nAnd despite the hype, excitement, and promise of 5G, as is often the case in the technology world, incremental improvements will deliver today, what revolutionary changes are promising for tomorrow. You\u2019re not going to be buying a 5G-capable device for years, but in the meantime, the LTE connection on your current smartphone should improve thanks to technology like carrier aggregation (as ZTE is using for its gigabit \u201cphone\u201d) and MIMO (where the connection between your mobile device and the cellular transmitter uses multiple sets of antennas). \nIf everyone at MWC is waiting for 5G like it\u2019s the second coming, it might be better to remember that with 4G, we can build the kingdom of heaven \u2014 and heavenly mobile data \u2014 here on Earth today. \n"}
