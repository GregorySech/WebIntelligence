{"content": " \nAs the opioid epidemic continues to spiral, more and more people have reason to seek information about addiction and its consequences. But finding unbiased information is extremely difficult \u2014 maybe more so than people realize.\nAccording to an investigation by The Verge, several popular publications covering addiction and treatment double as marketing operations for treatment centers. Rehab Reviews and The Fix are controlled by Cliffside Malibu founder Richard Taite, while Addiction Unscripted \u2014 a group promoted by Mark Zuckerberg this summer for its use of Facebook \u2014 is owned and staffed by the CEO and marketers of Windward Way, a treatment center in Costa Mesa, California. \nAll three sites have phone numbers that refer callers to the affiliated rehabs, as well as to partner facilities. On The Fix and Rehab Reviews, there\u2019s a note that the phone number routes you to Service Industries, a \u201cnetwork of commonly owned rehabilitation service providers,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t say which rehabs are in the network, or that Taite owns both the publishers and the providers. Users browsing with an ad blocker will not see the note, just the helpline.\nPopular publications covering addiction double as marketing operations\nWhile the connections between the rehabs and the sites are relatively well-known within the industry \u2014 Addiction Unscripted even used the Rehab Reviews practice of generating leads for Cliffside Malibu as an example to emulate in an early business plan obtained by The Verge \u2014 people reading the sites had no way to know the connection (until disclaimers appeared after The Verge approached the sites for comment). \nThe Fix, a popular addiction-focused news site, started in 2011 as what The New York Times called \u201ca Web site that combines feature writing, news, video and Zagat-like reviews of rehab facilities.\u201d Two years later, its parent company declared bankruptcy, and the website was sold to the private company, Clean & Sober Media, LLC. Clean & Sober Media also owns Rehab Reviews, which Forbes has called \u201ca Yelp.com for drug rehabs.\u201d \nAccording to a contract reviewed by The Verge and signed by Richard Taite, as well as conversations with people aware of the arrangement, Clean & Sober Media, LLC, is headed by Taite, owner of the California rehab Cliffside Malibu. Loren Beck, the chief legal officer of Cliffside Malibu, was the signatory on Clean & Sober Media\u2019s founding documents. The treatment center is consistently ranked No. 1 on Rehab Reviews\u2019 top 10 list, and given the most prominent spot on The Fix. \nThe treatment center is consistently ranked No. 1\nTaite also owns Access Malibu (as of October 31st, No. 6 on Rehab Reviews\u2019 top 10 list, and No. 8 on The Fix\u2019s top facilities page); Sunset Malibu (No. 4 on both sites); and Recovery Malibu (No. 8 on Rehab Reviews), according to documents filed with the California secretary of state. \n\u201cIt is correct that Cliffside Malibu and its affiliates collectively operate a total of eight facilities,\u201d a lawyer for Taite responded when The Verge asked for comment. \u201cAt certain times, various of these facilities have advertised on one or both websites. However, at no time, have any of these facilities been \u2018endorsed\u2019 by either Website, which provide reviews, not endorsements, of various facilities.\u201d The lawyer confirmed that Taite owned Clean & Sober Media.\nThe lawyer directed The Verge to the websites\u2019 terms and conditions, where one line now says that \u201cClean & Sober Media, LLC, which is now under common ownership with Cliffside Malibu and its affiliate organizations,\u201d bought The Fix in 2013, and Rehab Reviews in 2014.\nDisclaimers appeared after The Verge approached the sites for comment\nThe most recent archives on the Wayback Machine, from The Fix in September and Rehab Reviews in July, show no such disclaimers. \nSome mentions of Cliffside Malibu on The Fix (though not on the treatment center review) are \u201cfeatured,\u201d and hovering over an informational icon next to the \u201cFeatured Centers\u201d banner brings up text that says \u201cFeatured centers have paid for placement of their reviews in this section; however, the content and ratings contained in those reviews are editorial content created by The Fix.\u201d There\u2019s no indication that the companies share an owner.\nRehab Reviews doesn\u2019t note the connection to Cliffside at all, except on the new terms and conditions page. Visitors to the site, which bills itself as \u201cThe World\u2019s Largest & Most Trusted Resource for Rehab Reviews,\u201d are greeted by a picture of an ocean sunset that reads, \u201cHIGHEST RATED REHABS.\u201d Clicking it brings up the glowing review for Cliffside Malibu. (The site used to have a \u201cTop 10 Rehabs\u201d list in the main menu bar, with Cliffside Malibu consistently at #1, but it was removed after The Verge emailed Taite.)\nMost treatment centers have SEO-friendly blogs on their websites, often offering interesting perspectives on news items or debates about treatment. Hazelden Betty Ford has a whole publishing arm that puts out a variety of widely used educational resources. But when a site buries its material connections to a business it funnels customers into, it erodes public trust, and calls into question the information provided by the publication. \n\u201cIt\u2019s scummy, it\u2019s misleading.\u201d\nJoe Schrank, one of the two original founders of The Fix, has strong feelings about the marketing model their former site is now part of. \u201cIt\u2019s scummy, it\u2019s misleading,\u201d he told The Verge. After the acquisition, he and the other founder, Maer Roshan, discussed coming back as editors. But both ultimately felt the price was too high. \n\u201cThey wanted final editorial approval,\u201d Schrank said. \u201c\u2018Well, we\u2019ll probably never use it,\u2019 they said. We just couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nOne of The Fix\u2019s first stories, \u201cInside Scientology\u2019s Rehab Racket,\u201d was an expose on Scientology-affiliated rehab chain Narconon. According to Zachary Siegel, a journalist who started writing for the site in the early days, The Fix\u2019s appetite for reporting changed after the purchase, although he was unaware of Taite\u2019s involvement until The Verge told him. \n\u201cWhen it came to stories that dealt with exposing fraud and corruption, I was told that the publication didn\u2019t have resources to defend itself against litigious rehabs. I did manage to also get some fraud and corruption stuff into The Fix - it just didn\u2019t have the teeth that I wanted,\u201d Siegel said.\n\u201cI stand by everything I wrote at The Fix, but also, in the context of all the fraud and corruption going on in the industry, I do think there\u2019s a need for transparency here.\u201d (Siegel ultimately published several of those stories elsewhere.)\nThe Fix saw other changes under its new ownership, including the steadily increasing presence of free insurance verifications for treatment coverage, first in a blinking banner ad and then as a pop-up. Around the time of the transition, Cliffside Malibu appeared at the top of a new \u201cbest-rated rehabs\u201d section.\nThe review was first given a full five stars\nThe review for Cliffside got a nip / tuck, too. The archived, staff-written review of Cliffside Malibu from 2012 gives the center four stars. It\u2019s quite positive throughout, but mentions a few flaws. Originally, it highlighted the \u201ctop-notch staff,\u201d but said the \u201cmedical doctors used for calls or consultations were only \u2018somewhat helpful,\u2019 and occasionally look as though they\u2019ve just dropped by after brunch. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel the love,\u2019 said one alumnus.\u201d\nAfter Clean & Sober Media took over, the review was first given a full five stars, and then later changed to read: \u201calthough there are no live-in doctors, the on-call physicians are very accessible, helpful, responsive to patients\u2019 needs...One alum who went through detox five times before coming to Cliffside said it was the best detox experience he\u2019d had\u2014and most importantly, he hasn\u2019t needed it since.\u201d The review date still reads March 2012.\n\u201cAny implication that the content of an editorial review, including its aesthetics, is influenced by whether a treatment center has paid for advertising is false,\u201d Taite\u2019s lawyer said in a statement. \nMaer Roshan, Schrank\u2019s co-founder at The Fix, told The Verge that he believes addiction deserves a serious and credible news source. His and Schrank\u2019s original vision for the site was to not be associated with treatment centers at all. \u201cThat\u2019s what made the rehab reviews authentic,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that authenticity is shadowed by the ownership.\u201d \n\n\nClean & Sober Media is far from the only publisher owned in whole or in part by people with a financial interest in a treatment center or addiction-related business. Another is Addiction Unscripted, a group that gained recognition earlier this year when Mark Zuckerberg wrote a long Facebook post promoting both the website and its affiliated Facebook group, Affected By Addiction Support Group, which has over 52,000 members. (Addiction Unscripted itself has nearly 200,000 Facebook likes.) \n\u201cWe're looking for ways to help people find groups that will be meaningful to them,\u201d the Facebook founder wrote to his 97.8 million followers in July. \u201cDealing with addiction can be isolating and AddictionUnscripted.com is a place for people affected by addiction to come together. Now if you join their page, you can request to join the Affected By Addiction Support Group to connect with people who are going through the same thing.\u201d\nFacebook invited Addiction Unscripted co-founder Matt Mendoza and his partner Jeremy Broderick to the 2017 Facebook Communities Summit at Facebook headquarters, where Mendoza spoke about his role creating a \u201csafe space for people who are experiencing or recovering from drug and alcohol addiction.\u201d\nZuckerberg wrote a long Facebook post promoting the site and its affiliated Facebook group\nThat safe space has another purpose: generating admissions for Costa Mesa treatment center Windward Way and its sister facility, Casa Capri.\nBroderick, the CEO of Windward Way, owns about 20 percent of Addiction Unscripted. Mendoza is a marketer at Windward Way, with an office next to Broderick\u2019s. The phone number for Addiction Unscripted, listed on Affected By Addiction Support Group as the primary resource for people in need, rings to Windward Way\u2019s marketers.\n\u201cThe Affected By Addiction Support Group on Facebook is essentially mined and operated by admissions counselors at Windward Way,\u201d a source inside the company told The Verge. Marketers, including Mendoza, send private messages to people who post to the group, offering support and suggesting they call the hotline.\n\n  \n  Hacker Way.. Day #2 at Facebook.   A post shared by Matt Mendoza (@mattonprint) on Sep 21, 2017 at 7:33pm PDT\n\n\n\nAddiction Unscripted co-founder Matt Mendoza and Windward Way CEO Jeremy Broderick visiting the Facebook campus.\nMendoza, who was convicted of wire fraud in 2010, told The Verge that Facebook was aware of Broderick\u2019s connection to Windward Way, and that the support group was generating admissions for the rehab. When asked how the Facebook page grew so quickly, he declined to explain, saying it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of Matt\u2019s connection to Windward, and we have many other community leaders on Facebook using Groups as a channel to both create a community around a passion or cause, and as a way to financially support that community,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re always happy to see Groups and other Facebook tools as forces to build communities and create positive real-world impact.\u201d\nThe spokesperson went on to mention a rock collection fan page associated with a store that sells rocks, and a group for Unicorn Moms, defined as moms who \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less what you think.\u201d That group sells branded merchandise, including a mug that says, \u201cThere\u2019s a chance this is VODKA.\u201d\n\u201cThe Affected By Addiction Support Group on Facebook is essentially mined and operated by admissions counselors at Windward Way.\u201d\nThe Facebook spokesperson did not respond to a request for clarification that Facebook was comparing branded merchandising to rehab referral. \nBoth Broderick and Mendoza spoke to The Verge about their desire to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem, in addiction treatment ethics. \nMendoza denied that there was an ethical conflict in not disclosing the connection between the publisher and the rehabs. \u201cThe only intention is, for people who need help, this is a great facility, and it\u2019s the only one I know will do the right thing for the patient,\u201d he told The Verge. \u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to have these people around me, and Jeremy, who dedicated his people to answering the phone in very effective and ethical ways.\u201d  \n\u201cMatt\u2019s kind of the quarterback of it. I\u2019m just kind of a passenger in the car. I don\u2019t even speak the little techie language,\u201d Broderick told The Verge, saying that his relationship with Addiction Unscripted wasn\u2019t generating the number of admissions for Windward Way he was hoping it would when they first teamed up. \u201cIt\u2019s turned into something that I didn\u2019t intend it becoming, so I\u2019m probably going to be, effective today, severing all ties.\u201d\nShortly after that call, Addiction Unscripted\u2019s treatment center directory and reviews were taken down, and a disclaimer was added to the top: \u201cADDICTIONUNSCRIPTED.COM IS AFFILIATED WITH WINDWARDWAY RECOVERY, PHONE CALLS FROM THIS SITE ARE FORWARDED TO WINDWARDWAY RECOVERY AND THEIR ADDICTION SPECIALISTS.\u201d\nAfter the call, Addiction Unscripted\u2019s treatment center directory was taken down\nAddiction Unscripted was launched as a directory site, using user-generated and commissioned articles to drive leads. According to Mendoza, the company quickly pivoted toward social media, including Pandora and Grindr, along with Facebook. \nMendoza denied that every caller is sent to Windward Way or Casa Capri, only those who are a \u201cgood fit.\u201d For example, people who can\u2019t afford the treatment center, either through cash or insurance, are sent to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s (SAMHSA) treatment locator. Both Broderick and Mendoza said the majority of callers from Addiction Unscripted couldn\u2019t afford Windward Way.\nEarlier this week, apparently alerted to questions about his business model, Mendoza published a Huffington Post article defending his choice to partner with a treatment center, though the article doesn\u2019t mention which facility it is. (When asked why he didn\u2019t name the treatment center, Mendoza laughed and said, \u201cI didn't find that relevant. I didn't find it relevant at all. If somebody wanted to find out, it wouldn\u2019t be hard.\u201d)\nIn the post, Mendoza called for improved ethics in treatment center marketing.\nOn Facebook, the Affected By Addiction Support Group still has no mention of Windward Way, despite hosting a \u201ccall now\u201d button that rings to the rehab. That hotline is also listed in a pinned post of page rules. (\u201c...If you ever need help from an addiction counselor, please call our helpline...or send a private msg to Matthew Mendoza.\u201d) Another rule is no posting \u201cpictures or articles from other websites or treatment centers.\u201d\n\nAddiction Unscripted\u2019s now-deleted directory was an example of one of the strangest legacies of the eternal SEO war; The Fix and Rehab Reviews are both based around these old-school business directories, too. \nIt doesn\u2019t take much to create your own directory site. WordPress, for instance, has several templates. All you have to do is seed it with thousands of listings and get some traction in Google through links from high-value sites. (Talking to news sites as an \u201caddiction expert\u201d and asking for a backlink is a perennial favorite.) Once the site shows up in Google searches, business owners can be charged for better real estate on the site and more eye-catching listings.  \nIt listed the treatment center\u2019s name and address, but Addiction Unscripted\u2019s phone number\nTreatment marketers have it particularly easy, because they can legally copy listings from the free treatment locators offered by SAMHSA. While there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s much too hard to find treatment in the United States, directory sites don\u2019t tend to help much, since they\u2019re often full of inaccurate and incomplete information.\nAddiction Unscripted\u2019s now-deleted directory took things a step further. On any listing that didn\u2019t feature one of its own reviews, it listed the treatment center\u2019s name and address, but Addiction Unscripted\u2019s phone number, and no warning that it rings to a marketing hotline. (The Fix and Rehab Reviews include treatment centers\u2019 real numbers.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\nWhen asked about the lack of disclosure around his business interests, Broderick expressed frustration around what he painted as confusing regulations. \u201cYou don\u2019t know it\u2019s wrong until someone, like, all of a sudden someone says, \u2018Hey that\u2019s wrong,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what am I doing wrong? I didn\u2019t know this was wrong!\u2019 Obviously, getting people high, paying people, all the stuff you see in Florida is wrong, but a lot of this stuff is just arbitrary,\u201d he told The Verge. \nBut these secret connections create a black hole where good journalism should be, according to Schrank, co-founder of The Fix. \n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, in a lot of ways. The original intention of The Fix as a watchdog isn\u2019t being executed anywhere,\u201d Schrank told The Verge. Addicts and people who care about them are a huge audience that cuts across many demographics. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we sell them mountain bikes and jeans? Why do we have to sell them more treatment?\u201d\n", "title": "Review sites have deep ties to the rehabs they promote"}
