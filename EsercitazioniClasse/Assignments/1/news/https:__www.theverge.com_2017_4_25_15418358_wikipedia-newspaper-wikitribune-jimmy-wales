{"title": "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is taking on fake news with an online newspaper", "content": " \nThe co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, is launching a new online publication that aims to combat fake news. The project is called Wikitribune, and it will bring together professional journalists and a community of interested readers to produce and publish news stories. The site will be financed by a crowdfunding campaign (that launches today) and will focus on a range of issues \u2014 from US politics to specialists science and technology subjects.\nThe site\u2019s core mantra will be a dedication to facts, says Wales. Readers will be able to easily see the sources for each published story, and journalists will share materials like the transcripts and audio of interviews. \u201cWikitribune is news by the people and for the people,\u201d said Wales. \n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a very long time,\u201d Wales told The Verge. \u201cBut things came to a head for me post-Brexit and post-Donald Trump. There\u2019s a feeling things have gone wrong. The quality of media has declined in many areas \u2014 not all areas \u2014 and there\u2019s a real desire by the public for something more serious and more reliable.\u201d \nWales is initially looking to hire 10 professional journalists for the Wikitribune, and these individuals will work alongside members of the community who will help fact-check and copyedit articles. Any member of the public will be able to suggest edits to a story, but changes will have to be approved by a staff member or trusted volunteer before going live. \n\nThe site will be ad-free, meaning \u201cno one\u2019s relying on clicks to appease advertisers\u201d and there will be no paywall limiting access. Wales says the battle for attention online has been detrimental to the quality of the news, but praises publications like The New York Times and The Guardian that are increasingly relying on paying subscribers. He also says The Intercept \u2014 funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar \u2014 is \u201csuper interesting,\u201d but adds that \u201cphilosophically I think there\u2019s a problem if our model for journalism is to have wealthy billionaires funding side projects.\u201d\nWikitribune readers will be able take out monthly subscriptions of around $15, and in return will have influence over the site\u2019s coverage, suggesting topics they want reporters to write about. These could be specialist subjects, like Bitcoin, or local news coverage, if enough money can be raised to find a reporter in a specific area. Wales says this system won\u2019t affect the neutrality of the site, as all published articles will be subject to the same fact-checking and transparency standards. \nFunding is only one challenge for the Wikitribune, though, reaching people is another. Many media critics would argue that Facebook\u2019s algorithms have done as much to encourage bad media habits as websites\u2019 particular funding models. But Wales says he\u2019s confident that if the quality is good enough, Wikitribune won\u2019t need to optimize for social media. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s still true is that word of mouth is very powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople do talk about things. Wikipedia has never paid a penny for advertising, but yet remains one of the most popular things in the world.\u201d \nWhile Wales\u2019 aim is certainly noble, some journalism experts have questioned the impact such a site could have on the global news community. \u201cThere are a variety of people who \u2014 if it does this right \u2014 will view it as a trusted platform,\" Joshua Benton, director of Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab, told the BBC. \u201cBut another 10 to 20 people are not going to \u2018fix the news.\u2019 There's certainly a model for non-profit news that can be successful [...] but I have a hard time seeing this scale up into becoming a massive news organization.\u201d\nBut Wales says this is just the beginning, and that the first step is simply to attract funding and hire the journalists. English news will be the first to be covered, but he imagines the site will expand quickly into other languages, and sees German as a good second step. Mainly, though, Wales wants to attract \u201csupporters who believe in good journalism.\u201d He says: \u201cWe want to put out something thoughtful and serious that people read and they think \u2018that really moves the needle for me.\u2019\u201d\n"}
