{"title": "Russia reportedly organized pro-Trump rallies on Facebook", "content": " \nMore and more details have been coming out about how Russia used Facebook to spread pro-Trump propaganda during the 2016 US election, and today The Daily Beast has published evidence that appears to show a Putin-linked Facebook group organizing rallies that Trump supporters in the US actually attended.\nThe Daily Beast identified a Facebook group called \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d that was shut down around the same time that other Russian-linked Facebook accounts were purged. The page also posted memes watermarked and framed in a similar style as those other pages, according to the report, which suggests the page came from the same source. It\u2019s not a perfect link, but it strongly implies Being Patriotic was among the Russian propaganda pages; Facebook told The Daily Beast that it could not confirm the details.\nAlong with posting memes, the Being Patriotic page also tried to organize four rallies, according to the report. One of those was supposed to be a \u201cpatriotic state-wide flash mob\u201d occurring simultaneously in 17 cities across Florida in support of Trump. The Daily Beast says it found evidence that at least two of those rallies materialized \u2014 Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs \u2014 and were documented on Facebook by the local campaign chair for Trump.\nThe account appears to come from \u201cprofessional trolls\u201d\nThe Being Patriotic account reportedly had over 200,000 followers at the time it was shut down, and had tried to organize other pro-Trump or anti-Hillary events in New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. A related Twitter account also posted at least one comment promoting violence against Black Lives Matters supporters. \nThe Daily Beast suggests the Being Patriotic account came from the Internet Research Agency, a Russian group that US intelligence has identified as \u201cprofessional trolls\u201d funded by a \u201cclose Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence.\u201d\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first Facebook account that\u2019s been publicly tied to Russian propagandists, this appears to be the first time we\u2019re seeing Russian efforts to organize Trump supporters for physical demonstrations. That it ultimately worked, to at least some extent, shows that the propaganda campaign had real and tangible effects beyond the spread of memes.\nFacebook said earlier this month that it had found evidence of Russians buying political ads during the campaign, spending $100,000 under fake accounts. That\u2019s not a huge amount of money for Facebook, but it\u2019s clear their work led to some results.\nThe Trump campaign is certainly aware of how effective targeted Facebook posts can be. BuzzFeed reported today that the president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s Facebook pages are paying for ads that are only visible to groups of users \u2014 likely their own supporters \u2014 that they choose to target. The ads are asking for donations.\n"}
