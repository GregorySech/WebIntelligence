{"title": "The SXSW chatbot doesn\u2019t want me to die", "content": " \nLike the term \u201crobot\u201d or \u201cAI,\u201d \u201cchatbot\u201d covers a wide spectrum of machine intelligence, from eerily smart digital assistants to the equivalent of multiple-choice quiz delivery systems. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so much fun to mess with: you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll get something that can explain the finer plot points of The Matrix to you, or something that responds to every query with a random Google search. The SXSW festival app has a chatbot, and unsurprisingly, it\u2019s pretty dumb. But occasionally, you\u2019ll find a topic where the creators decided to specifically craft a response \u2014 and one of them is my death date.\nThe bot is named Abby, and I started our conversation with the big question, asking her the meaning of life. She responded with a boilerplate block of text plugging the SXSW Platinum badge. I then asked if Barack Obama was planning a coup, which she handled with a diplomatic \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure\u201d \u2014 better than Google\u2019s answer, at least.\nThis pretty much set the tone of our conversation. I\u2019d give Abby some absurd query, and she\u2019d either punt or give me search results from the schedule. Will New York secede from America? Here are some session results for \u201cWill,\u201d \u201cNew,\u201d and \u201cYork.\u201d When will the Great Purges of 2033 happen? Maybe I\u2019d like to attend \u201cLet\u2019s Make Javascript Great Again!\u201d How can we eradicate racism? Abby turned up \u201cThe info on Shuttles is here,\u201d which was honestly our most confusing interaction, especially because she couldn\u2019t parse my direct request for the Austin Convention Center address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was perfectly willing to accept this, until I gave Abby a more personal question. \u201cWhen will I die?\u201d I asked, ready for an \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that\u201d or a death metal concert listing. Her response was a weird flicker of Siri-like intelligence in a glorified search engine. \u201cI hope it won\u2019t happen soon,\u201d she told me. \u201cI am dead,\u201d I told her later. \u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d Abby responded.\nAs it turns out, there are a few things Abby can answer specifically. If I ask who I am, she\u2019ll say I\u2019m \u201cobviously someone who is on the cutting edge of technology.\u201d If I ask whether she\u2019s friends with Siri, she\u2019ll diplomatically note that she\u2019s \u201cmade lots of new friends so far.\u201d But she\u2019s short on the obvious chatbot tricks: there\u2019s no witty reply if you ask about living in the Matrix, and asking her to tell you a joke gets you search results for \u201ca\u201d and \u201cjoke.\u201d\nThe point is, I can\u2019t get a bead on Abby, and it\u2019s maddening. I have a feeling this is going to be happening a lot with chatbots in the future, until they\u2019ve fully graduated from the novelty stage \u2014 which might not happen for a long time. I just hope the other events I cover won\u2019t start baiting me into asking their scheduling apps about my darkest fears too.\n"}
