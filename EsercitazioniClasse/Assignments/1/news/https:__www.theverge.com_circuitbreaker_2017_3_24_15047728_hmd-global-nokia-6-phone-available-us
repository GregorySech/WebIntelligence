The phones all feature as pure a version of Android Nougat as possible, meaning no third-party apps or UI customizations, and the promise of regular security updates.\nThe Nokia 6 is the largest of the devices, with a 5.5-inch display, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 430 processor. It also features an eight-megapixel front-facing camera and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The matte black, silver, blue, or copper versions of the device will retail for $242, while the glossy black will cost $315. The smaller Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 will be priced at $199 and $147, respectively.\n"}
