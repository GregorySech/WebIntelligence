{"title": "Google will \u2018permanently remove\u2019 Home Mini feature that led to constant recording", "content": " \nGoogle has decided to \u201cpermanently remove\u201d the feature that led to a \u201csmall number\u201d of Home Mini units accidentally recording thousands of times a day, instead of just when a user triggers it. In a statement released today, the company said that it made the decision because \u201cwe want people to have complete peace of mind while using Google Home Mini.\u201d\nThe Home Mini shipped with a feature that let owners activate the Google Assistant and control music by tapping the top of the speaker. But it turned out that some units had an issue: they would register touches even when no one was there, leading the units to start recording over and over and over again, which is pretty darn creepy. Android Police identified the error on one of its review units, and Google resolved the problem before any Home Mini units could actually ship out to customers (aside from however many it gave out at events). The software fix is supposed to be rolled out October 15th, a few days before the Mini ships.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nGoogle Home Mini review: chasing Dots\n\n\nGoogle had seemingly hoped to return the top button functionality to the Home Mini at a later date, but now the company seems to have given up on that \u2014 either because it couldn\u2019t figure out a way to do it, or simply out of an abundance of caution. (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s both; the potential for the Mini to turn into a constant surveillance device would be a huge liability.) Either way, it\u2019s not the biggest loss, but it\u2019s not great to see such a major issue come up right as a product is about to ship.\nWith the top button gone, the Home Mini now has to be activated entirely by voice, which isn\u2019t really a huge limitation since it\u2019s designed to be a voice assistant. The Mini\u2019s left and right buttons will continue to work for adjusting the volume.\n"}
