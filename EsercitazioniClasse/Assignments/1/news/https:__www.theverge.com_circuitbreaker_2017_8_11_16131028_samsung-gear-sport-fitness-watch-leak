{"title": "Samsung\u2019s next fitness watch is probably coming this month", "content": " \nSamsung is headed to IFA later this month, and it\u2019s starting to sound like we\u2019ll see some new smartwatches there. Android Headlines spotted an FCC filing from Samsung showing off a Samsung Gear Sport, a thus-far nonexistent smartwatch or fitness device of some kind.\nGiven that it\u2019s passing through the FCC right now, the device is probably almost ready to be released. Samsung used its IFA presentation to introduce a new generation of Gear smartwatches this time last year, so it makes sense that we\u2019re seeing hints of that happening again this year, too.\nLike Apple, turning smartwatches\u2019 focus to fitness\nAll we really know so far is that the Gear Sport supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and probably runs Tizen, given the lack of Galaxy branding. It\u2019s not clear if it\u2019ll take the shape of a smartwatch or be closer to a long fitness tracker, but the most recent Gear devices have all had identical round shapes. The last Gear-branded fitness band was released just over a year ago.\nA sports-focused watch would make plenty of sense. Apple has really refocused the Apple Watch around fitness, while Samsung\u2019s Gear watches are still going for a much more fashionable look. Making a new model that\u2019s more tailored to exercise would help it better compete with Apple and could get more people interested in the product.\nIf Samsung does release a sports-focused watch, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see it introduce other styles of the devices as well. But so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything on it. \n"}
