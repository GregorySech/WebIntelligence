{"title": "The Moto G5 and G5 Plus have metal designs and very affordable prices", "content": " \nLenovo has officially announced the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus, two new Android 7.0 Nougat smartphones that will begin shipping in March. The G series is the best-selling phone under Moto\u2019s brand. Traditionally, they\u2019ve proven to be decent phones for very attractive prices. This year the company has completely overhauled the design to focus on a premium metal finish. They look less like their predecessors, with an appearance that\u2019s much closer to the recent Moto Z family. \nThe aluminum backplate definitely results in a positive first impression for the G5 and its larger variant an impressive \u2014 as do the displays. The G5 has a 5-inch LCD display, while the G5 Plus has a bigger (but not too big) 5.2-inch screen, which feels just about perfect in hand. Both panels are Full HD 1080p. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoto G5\n\n\nFrom there, the specs between both G5s vary quite a bit \u2014 and line up perfectly with the leaks. The regular G5 has a Snapdragon 430 processor, while the G5 Plus gets the Snapdragon 625 (which we loved in the Moto Z Play for its balance of performance and battery-sipping longevity). The G5\u2019s camera is a 13-megapixel f/2.0 system with phase detect autofocus, and the G5 Plus ups that slightly with a 12-megapixel f/1.7 camera with dual-focus pixels. It can record 4K video, while the G5 is limited to Full HD. Both have a 5MP selfie cam up front. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoto G5 Plus\n\n\nStorage for the G5 is either 16GB or 32GB of built-in flash depending on the region where you buy it, with support for microSD cards up to 128GB. The G5 Plus comes in two capacities \u2014 32GB or 64GB \u2014 also with expandable storage. RAM ranges between 2GB and 4GB, again depending on the market you\u2019re in. Only the G5 Plus will be sold in the United States. Both phones support dual-SIM setups. The G5 has a respectable (and removable!) 2,800mAh battery; the G5 Plus gets a sealed 3,000mAh battery. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moto G5\u2019s back cover is removable, which isn\u2019t the case with the G5 Plus. \n\n\nThe G5 and G5 Plus each come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and feature some of Moto\u2019s excellent software customizations. You get Moto Display for notifications, and the same gestures (shake for camera, etc.) as other Moto phones. There\u2019s also something new: if you want to, you can disable Android\u2019s on-screen buttons and use swiping gestures on the larger-than-usual fingerprint sensor instead. Swipe left over the fingerprint reader for back, and swipe right for multitasking view. When this setting is enabled, those buttons go away to give your content more room on screen. I\u2019d probably still stick with the virtual buttons, since it\u2019d be hard to breaking such a core Android habit. \nOh! And they\u2019re getting Google Assistant, if you hadn\u2019t heard. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t yet active on the demo units I briefly put through the paces earlier today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moto G5 lets you turn off Android\u2019s on-screen buttons and use swipe gestures instead.\n\n\nHere\u2019s one downside about both new Moto devices: they lack NFC, so you can forget about Android Pay. That\u2019s in the US, anyway. The G5 Plus won\u2019t have it here, but will internationally. A Lenovo spokesperson said this decision was made because mobile payments are far more popular elsewhere in the world as adoption ramps up slower in the US. Completely ignoring the technology in an otherwise very nice, inexpensive smartphone won\u2019t do anything to help that pace... Anyway, neither phone has wireless charging, though the G5 Plus supports Moto\u2019s TurboCharge for faster top-offs. \nBoth the G5 and G5 Plus will launch worldwide in March in \u201cfine gold\u201d and \u201clunar gray.\u201d  Pricing will vary based on hardware configuration and territory, but the Moto G5 will start at \u20ac199 (no US release, remember) with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, with the G5 Plus starting slightly higher at $229 USD with 2GB RAM and 32GB of storage. The unlocked Moto G5 Plus will be compatible with all major US networks. I spent just a few minutes with both devices, but assuming the lack of NFC isn\u2019t a dealbreaker, they seem like a very impressive evolution of the Moto G\u2019s winning formula: good phone, cheap price. That\u2019s especially true of the G5 Plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoto G5\n\n\n"}
