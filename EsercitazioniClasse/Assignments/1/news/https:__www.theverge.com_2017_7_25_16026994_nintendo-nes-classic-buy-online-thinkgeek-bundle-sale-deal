{"title": "This is probably your last chance to get an NES Classic (update: sold out)", "content": " \n(Update 5:20pm: All sold out). \nMissed out on the NES Classic? Already eagerly looking forward to being disappointed by not being able to purchase a SNES Classic this fall? Well, don\u2019t give up hope just yet. ThinkGeek (which is owned by GameStop) has just put up one last batch of the NES Classic on its website. \nThere is a catch, though\nThere is one catch, though: ThinkGeek isn\u2019t selling the mini retro console as a standalone item for the usual retail price of $59.99. Rather, there\u2019s a choice of six bundles ranging from $139.99 (which gets you the console, three canvas art prints, a Zelda jigsaw puzzle, and a Piranha Plant puppet) to $219.99 (for a bundle that includes a wearable Mega Man helmet, arm cannon, and mug). Still, even considering the fact that you\u2019re stuck with the extra bundled items, it\u2019s a better deal than almost anything we\u2019ve seen these days on the secondhand market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: ThinkGeek\n\n\nThis also might be the last time the discontinued console goes on sale online, so if you\u2019ve been trying to get one, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re still doing here reading this post. \nSupplies of the console \u2014 even though they\u2019re being sold with extra baggage in bundles \u2014 will probably run out very fast if past history is anything to go by, so best of luck. If not, it\u2019s never too early to start camping out on the SNES Classic preorder pages.\n"}
