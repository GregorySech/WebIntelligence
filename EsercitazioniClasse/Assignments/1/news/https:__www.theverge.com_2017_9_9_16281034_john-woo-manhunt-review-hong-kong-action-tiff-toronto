{"title": "John Woo\u2019s Manhunt plays like a joyous parody of his action classics", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review comes from the Toronto International Film Festival. \nIt\u2019s always possible that John Woo could have played the doves straight. The Hong Kong director behind action classics like Hard Boiled, and A Better Tomorrow (and later American movies including Face/Off, Broken Arrow) has turned the image of doves flying across the screen during a firefight into a signature trope, suggesting the end of innocence and the arrival of chaos. But in his latest, Manhunt, when a careening car approaches a dovecote filled with birds ready for their big moment, it doesn\u2019t read as portentous and tragic, like the dove sequences in Woo\u2019s The Killer or Mission: Impossible II. Instead, it reads like a conscious in-joke for savvy audiences \u2014 especially when the car circles the cage teasingly before slamming into it and sending the doves across the screen.\nThat isn\u2019t the only in-joke in Manhunt: toward the end, one character pointedly name-checks Woo\u2019s filmography by promising \u201ca better tomorrow.\u201d Another says goodbye to a friend with a finger-gun gesture, but holds the finger-gun sideways, in homage to another Woo trademark. In a more serious film, these moments might all pass as simple nods to Woo\u2019s career and his fandom.\nBut in the deliberately goofy, over-the-top Manhunt, they\u2019re more like sharp elbows to the side, an ongoing whisper-shout of \u201cSee what I did there?\u201d Like so many Woo films, Manhunt is well aware of Hong Kong movie history and the visual language of international action movies. But it also approaches satire in its ridiculous mining of tropes and its conscious visual excesses. Everyone involved looks like they\u2019re a moment away from outright winking at the camera. And the plot, which involves super-soldier assassins and the comically evil conglomerate enabling them, is often equally hard to take seriously.\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nAction, mystery, and action parody. It\u2019s a remake of the 1976 Japanese thriller Manhunt, with both movies based on a Juk\u00f4 Nishimura novel. But American audiences will probably see more of a touchstone in the 1963 TV series The Fugitive and its 1993 film remake. All these stories follow the same path, with a man framed for murder and trying to track down the real killer, while a tough but ultimately sympathetic lawman chases him down.\nWhat\u2019s it about?\nThere are a lot of plot threads running through Manhunt. In the primary one, Chinese lawyer Du Qiu (Zhang Hanyu) is about to leave Osaka after managing a successful lawsuit involving the vast family conglomerate Teijin Pharmaceuticals. Then a woman turns up dead in his bed, the cop who comes to arrest him murders a different cop and tries to frame him for that killing as well, and Du Qiu ends up on the run. Meanwhile, two ruthless female assassins, Rain and Dawn, murder a pack of criminals. Cranky investigator Yamuna (Masaharu Fukuyama) deals with bubbly rookie partner Rika (Nanami Sakuraba) and their corrupt co-workers. Yet another plot involves the outcome of Du Qiu\u2019s lawsuit, a woman who wants to see him dead as a result, and a secret formula to create unstoppable, bestial ultra-soldiers. \nBut primarily, it\u2019s about the manhunt for Du Qiu, which gives Woo plenty of opportunities for hand-to-hand combat, gun fights, and big chase sequences, including the inevitable one through a vast parade, and a much less inevitable and more surprising one involving jet skis.\n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a whole lot of subtext going on here, apart from the vague hand-waving confirmation that big companies and corrupt cops are bad, and little-guy underdogs and justice are good. And also that jet skis can soar through the air in slow motion if you just gun them hard enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIFF\n\n\nIs it good?\nIt\u2019s pretty hilarious, but that only goes so far in an action movie. Zhang and Fukuyama both declaim their dialogue (primarily English, with a fair bit of Japanese and Mandarin thrown in) with a deadpan force that makes almost everything they say seem overblown and faintly ridiculous. Some of that dialogue also seems to be written expressly for laughs \u2014 especially when Yamuna tells Du Qiu, \u201cTrust me, there\u2019s only one end for a fugitive \u2014 a dead end.\u201d The suggested emotions are big, broad, and exaggerated, but the leads express those emotions with an exaggeratedly serious version of unbending macho. The action is similarly straight-faced in a laughable way: when that jet ski goes flying over Yamuna\u2019s head, it passes him in slow motion, trailing CGI water in a bit of balletic choreography that\u2019s charming and hilariously excessive at the same time.\nBut as with other straight-faced genre parodies like Shoot \u2019Em Up and Drive Angry, the more-is-more approach doesn\u2019t supply many real stakes for the characters, beyond the momentary question of how a given chase will come out. Woo\u2019s action sequences, always the heart of his movies, are at their best in Manhunt when he keeps them small and focused. A fistfight between Du Qiu and Yamuna in a moving car, which keeps veering toward the edge of a cliff as they fight for control, keeps the scale personal and the choreography clear. A later battle lets Woo pull off some signature moves, including combatants firing wildly while sliding down a flight of stairs, but it also gets exasperatingly chaotic and meaningless. Half the participants are masked assassins pulled out of absolutely nowhere to make a big splash and get shot, and virtually all of the rest have plot immunity. The small handful of cool stunts \u2014 including a moment where Du Qiu and Yamuna, handcuffed together, flawlessly coordinate the reloading and firing of a single handgun with their uncuffed hands \u2014 doesn\u2019t entirely justify the pileup of uninteresting and anonymous bodies. \nManhunt feels like an extended goof on Woo\u2019s career, and on the audience \u2014 it\u2019s as though he\u2019s laughing at action fans for what they traditionally find impressive. The fact that he\u2019s in on the joke, and that some of the jokes are at his own expense, makes the film go down smoothly enough. But it easily could have gotten by with half as many characters, half as many chases, and a hard limit of only, say, two dozen people flying through plate glass windows with no particular justification.\nWhat should it be rated?\nIn spite of a lot of flying blood and bodies, Manhunt comes across as a pretty casual PG-13, with fairly minimal gore and only the mildest, most chaste hints at sexual content. \nHow can I actually watch it?\nManhunt is slated for Chinese release on November 24. It\u2019s still looking for American distribution.\n"}
