{"title": "The SanDisk iXpand Base is an iPhone charger that also backs up your phone", "content": " \nThe SanDisk iXpand Base (a real product name that somehow survived to reach the market) is an iPhone charger with a nifty trick up its sleeve: it\u2019ll back up your phone when you charge it (via Digital Photography Review). \nIt\u2019s not a perfect backup solution \u2014 due to the way iOS actually works, the iXpand Base can only store photos, videos, and contacts \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly a useful option for those who prefer local storage or are out of iCloud backup space. SanDisk is selling the iXpand Base in four storage capacities: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB, for $49.99, $99.99, $129.99, and $199.99, respectively. \nThe iXpand Base works over a Lighting to USB cable (not included), which you can conveniently coil inside the iXpand Base, and then plugs into a wall outlet to provide 15W of power. You can also transfer files directly from the iXpand Base to a computer using an SD card or a Micro USB cable, or access them on your phone through a new SanDisk iXpand Base iOS app. \n"}
