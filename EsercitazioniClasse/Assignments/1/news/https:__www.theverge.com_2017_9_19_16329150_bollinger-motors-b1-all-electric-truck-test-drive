{"title": "Bollinger\u2019s all-electric truck makes its first test track appearance", "content": " \nEarlier this summer, an East Coast startup called Bollinger Motors unveiled the B1: an all-electric, half-truck half-Jeep with up to 200 miles of range and a heavy focus on utility. But since the company had only just finished building the truck in the weeks before the event, there wasn\u2019t much footage of it moving. Today Bollinger published a handful of new videos, though, two of which offer glimpses of the B1 screaming around a test track near Albany, New York. \nThere\u2019s not a ton of information to be gleaned from these videos, as they\u2019re short and sharply edited. Some of the clips have even been sped up, so it\u2019s also hard to say just how fast the truck was really going. Bollinger claims the truck\u2019s dual-motor setup can go from 0-60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds thanks to 360 horsepower and 472 pound-feet of torque, but these videos don\u2019t help bear any of that out. \n\nAs Tesla has demonstrated, creating a successful new car company isn\u2019t easy, so if founder Robert Bollinger wants to reach his admittedly modest goals (like making around 10,000 B1s per year), this is far from the last baby step he needs to take. But while a ton of questions still remain about Bollinger, the idea is just as exciting as it was in July, maybe even more so now that we are seeing the thing move. \n"}
