{"title": "DJI\u2019s new drone can fly in rain or snow", "content": " \nThe big story in the drone industry over the last year has been the collapse of several high-profile consumer-facing efforts and a pivot to industrial-grade units. Now the market leader is getting in on the action. DJI announced the Matrice 200 today, an all-weather unit that can carry up to three cameras at once and packs a wealth of sensors that allow it to capture navigate with centimeter lever precision. \nThe M200 has a forward-facing camera built into its nose for the pilot, and has a dual gimbal underneath that can carry a powerful zoom lens and thermal imaging camera at the same time. If you\u2019re in the market for something that can do bridge inspection, DJI also offers a top-mounted gimbal that can face directly above the drone. \n\nThis camera combo could be used to look for heat leaks on a large building or structural faults on a power plant. The thermal camera finds the right area, and the zoom lens allows the drone to get a detailed view of a particular area without getting too close. DJI claims the camera can identify millimeter-sized faults in buildings, roads, and bridges in real time. In a search and rescue situation the thermal camera could be used to identify a heat source, and the zoom lens to grab a closeup. \nThe M200 is the third unit in the Matrice line, smaller than the M600 hexacopter and a bit larger and more fully featured than the M100, which was meant primarily as a testbed and developer platform. The M200 has two batteries, giving it 35 minutes of flight time. You can also hot swap the batteries, allowing you to quickly replace a depleted unit without turning the aircraft completely off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M200 has sensors on its front, rear, and top that scan for obstacles and work to prevent collisions. It also has an ADS-B receiver built in. ADS-B is the system used by all manned aircraft, so the M200 will be able to detect when a passenger plane is entering its airspace well before the pilot or sensors can see the actual aircraft.\nThe M200 will be going up against units like Yuneec\u2019s Typhoon H520, SenseFly\u2019s Albris, Freefly Alta 8, and Intel\u2019s Falcon 8. DJI hasn\u2019t released a price on this unit yet, but says it should be available to purchase in the second quarter of 2017.\nPhotography by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\n"}
