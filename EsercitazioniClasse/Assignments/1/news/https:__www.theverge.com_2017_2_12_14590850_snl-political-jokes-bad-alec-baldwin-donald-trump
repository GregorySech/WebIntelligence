{"title": "Saturday Night Live just can\u2019t stop taking the easy way out", "content": " \nSaturday Night Live is enjoying its highest ratings in over 20 years, despite lending absolutely no credence to the argument that comedy might improve under the Trump administration. \nOf course SNL always feels most relevant when political stakes are high, but the buzz around the show has reached a new pitch in recent months because of how directly it affects our thin-skinned new president. He spent some of the first weeks of his time as president-elect tweeting about Alec Baldwin\u2019s \u201cunwatchable\u201d impression of him and referring to the whole cast as \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cnot funny.\u201d Though it is probably always the case that politicians will tune into SNL to see how they\u2019re being ridiculed, Trump is the first to complain about it week after week, letting us know that he can\u2019t stop watching and that it really, truly bothers him. (The VoteVets PAC even purchased ad time this week in hopes that it would help them get the president\u2019s attention.)\nYet the writers of Saturday Night Live don\u2019t seem to have it in them to confront the horrors of Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office with any sort of weight or edge. Melissa McCarthy\u2019s  blustery, hyper-masculine Sean Spicer impression is funny only because she\u2019s one of the best physical comedians alive, not because anyone wrote her any great material for it. The rest of last night\u2019s mostly political episode was a series of riffs on the easiest possible joke you could make about anything Trump does: he\u2019s stupid and he\u2019s sad and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. Michael Che takes a full minute out of Weekend Update to announce that he feels sort of bad for Trump, who clearly doesn\u2019t want to be president and made a mistake choosing to spend \u201cthe last two years\u201d of his life this way. \u201cJust quit,\u201d he suggests, which is of course what most of the GOP and his heinous vice president (who has somehow avoided all mention on the nation\u2019s most popular comedy show) would love.\n\nThe Weekend Update writers, it seems, barely read the news, and can\u2019t muster anything better than \u201cthat\u2019s like asking your Uber driver to get out and push\u201d in response to Kellyanne Conway receiving ethics counseling after promoting Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line on TV. \u201cCounseling? Her job title is literally counselor to the president.\u201d On Trump\u2019s all-caps \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT\u201d to the Ninth District federal judges who denied his appeal to reinstate an unconstitutional ban on travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, Weekend Update has this to say: \u201cThat\u2019s like losing a fight in an alley and then yelling \u2018let\u2019s take this outside!\u2019\u201d Yeah, and what exactly... is up with airline food?\nKate McKinnon did a few minutes as a breathless Elizabeth Warren, who was in the news this week after she was cut off in the middle of reading a letter from Coretta Scott King at Jeff Sessions\u2019 Attorney General confirmation hearing. The central joke in that bit was that Warren is an embarrassing try-hard, who does too much and has no one helping her except Bernie Sanders and \u201cSchumer... Amy Schumer, that is.\u201d It\u2019s not only not funny, but patently incorrect to suggest that Warren and Sanders are the Democrats leading the resistance against Trump. When McKinnon\u2019s cleaning up her impression of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, then we\u2019ll know that someone on Saturday Night Live\u2019s writing team actually opened a newspaper. \nthe weekend update writers barely read the news\n McKinnon also reprised her Kellyanne Conway impression, playing her as Glenn Close\u2019s character in Fatal Attraction, begging to be let back on CNN with Jake Tapper. Because it\u2019s McKinnon it\u2019s fun to watch, but this conceit would barely even land as a joke tweet, much less a five-minute sketch. In fact there\u2019s much better comedy about Conway on Twitter any day of the week. Is it that funny to say \u201cshe\u2019s crazy\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s obsessed with fame\u201d over and over? The takeaway from this sketch is the same as it was when McKinnon played Conway as Chicago\u2019s Roxie Hart three weeks ago, and it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to rebut as sexist. \n\nWhen the President\u2019s an idiot, there\u2019s an argument that it might not really matter. Any joke about Donald Trump or any person on his staff bothers him, and in the most predictable of ways. After Melissa McCarthy debuted her Sean Spicer impression last week, sources within the White House reportedly told Politico that the president was particularly upset by the fact that his press secretary was being lampooned by a woman.\nThough Rosie O\u2019Donnell lobbied for an opportunity to follow that humiliation up with another \u2014 volunteering to be the first to play Steve Bannon on Saturday Night Live \u2014 the show left that chance to troll the president on the floor. But they half-heartedly picked at some others this week: McKinnon, who is at this point pretty much a one-woman show, donned troll makeup and a weasely grin to play Jeff Sessions for less than two minutes, barely getting the joke \u201cwe all know there are two kinds of crime, regular and black,\u201d in before McCarthy called an end to the cold open. In a digital short illogically reserved for the tail-end of the episode, Leslie Jones dressed up as Trump to audition for the part in front of Lorne Michaels. \n\n\nCHEAH!!! pic.twitter.com/1H4A6hyJfj\u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) February 12, 2017\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a hilarious bit, but for whatever reason the writers decided to deliberately undercut the principal insult of it \u2014 that a black woman can ridicule Trump on a national stage and he has no means to embarrass her back. While Jones preps her impression, her castmates ask \u201cis this a Hamilton thing?\u201d and \u201cis this about his fragile masculinity?\u201d She says \u201cno,\u201d it\u2019s just about her getting to play the President. The sketch is still funny and not everything has to be a deliberate swing directly at Trump, but it\u2019s weird to see the writers intentionally and awkwardly side-stepping the inherent politics of the joke. \nMaybe the problem then is that Saturday Night Live is only writing to piss Trump off, and Trump\u2019s just not that hard to piss off. He\u2019s reactionary and unsubtle, constantly fazed by the slightest of insults and addicted to all forms of attention. The people tuning into Saturday Night Live in hopes of seeing some of the week\u2019s horrific events sifted into coherent satire aren\u2019t getting that because it\u2019s not necessary for what Saturday Night Live is trying to do: make the easiest joke that riles up Trump and doesn\u2019t risk alienating any of their newly massive audience.\n"}
