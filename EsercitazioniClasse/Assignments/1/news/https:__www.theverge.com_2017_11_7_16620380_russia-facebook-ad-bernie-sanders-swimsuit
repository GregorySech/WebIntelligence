{"title": "Why were the Russian Facebook ads so strange?", "content": " \nLast week, as Facebook testified before Congress about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, committees released the first batch of Kremlin-linked ads that ran on the platform. They were much weirder than anyone expected. There was plenty of straightforward political button-pushing, of course \u2014 the groups put forth both faux Black Lives Matter and gun rights campaigns \u2014 but some of the ads were harder to explain. One ad put forward a Speedo-clad Bernie Sanders, lifted from a real-life picture book. Another showed a Hillary-supporting Satan preparing to arm-wrestle Jesus Christ.\nThis is not what we expect from a foreign propaganda campaign. There is no call to vote for a given candidate, and despite widespread concerns over fake news, there\u2019s no clear effort to spread false information. Russia experts have always said that the country\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t look like traditional propaganda, but even so, these ads seemed unusual. While Facebook, Twitter, and Google confront hard questions about their role in Russian election interference, the techniques in play seem more important than ever. So why were the Russian ads so strange? \n\u201cA portrayal of the contending forces in the world\u201d\nWhile many of the ads seem amateurish, some experts see a sophisticated understanding of what travels on social media. Laura Rosenberger, who studies Russian influence operations as director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, says weirdness can be a natural result of narrow targeting. As a given message speaks to a smaller group, it ends up more bewildering to everyone else. \u201cThe ads you categorize as \u2018bizarre\u2019 could have currency with very narrow groups,\u201d says Rosenberger. \u201cOne of Russia\u2019s goals is to push groups to extremes, and so some of what we are seeing is likely aimed at encouraging the most radical elements of certain groups, or pushing groups in a more radical direction.\u201d\nIn the case of Speedo Bernie, that\u2019s consistent with the targeting information included as part of the release. You might think Speedo Bernie was a false flag, distributed to alienate evangelical groups who might be curious about Sanders \u2014 but in fact, it was more straightforward than that. The ad was targeted at Facebook users interested in LGBT rights and either of the two leading Democratic candidates, exactly the people most likely to love Speedo Bernie. \n\u201cIt needs to be authentic and it needs to be humorous. Either that or it needs to be dark and make you angry.\u201d\nAt the same time, the ads don\u2019t seem to be about news. False information continues to be a problem on Google and Facebook \u2014 but the released ads suggest the Russian operations weren\u2019t about information at all. A report published last week by Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center pointed to James Carey\u2019s ritual theory of communication sharing as a better model for the ads. According to that theory, the function of news is as much about drama as information, giving readers \u201ca portrayal of the contending forces in the world.\u201d Satan arm-wrestling Jesus doesn\u2019t tell you any new information, but to an evangelical audience, it might offer a compelling way to think about political news \u2014 particularly if you see your friends and neighbors sharing it.\nAccording to Claire Wardle, who co-authored the report, the ritual model is the best tool we have for understanding why certain things play better on social media. \u201cThe [Russian ad-makers] understand social media better than a lot of advertising agencies,\u201d Wardle told me. \u201cThey understand it needs to be authentic and it needs to be humorous. Either that or it needs to be dark and make you angry.\u201d\nThe ads also seem amateurish, full of bad photoshops or sloppy imagery \u2014 but for observers, that was a sign of someone who knows how to game the algorithm. Caroline Jack, who studies misinformation at Data & Society, saw Speedo Bernie\u2019s casual artistry as a play for shares. \u201cThis is such an unusual image that it\u2019s a good way to catch people\u2019s attention,\u201d Jack says. \u201cThe people who ran that page are trying to get engagement.\u201d\nThe result is a surprisingly familiar technique. The ads were designed to be shareable, engaging, and targeted at specific groups \u2014 like nearly everything else in your Facebook feed. We\u2019re still only seeing a tiny part of the Russian effort, and it\u2019s plausible there are more alarming parts of the campaign that are yet to be discovered or released. But so far, the Russian influence operation seems to have been using many of the same tactics as most advertisers, even if it was using them toward less straightforward ends.\nThat may not be a comforting thought. Hossein Derakhshan, who coauthored the Shorenstein report, says there are many other groups using the same tactics as the Russian trolls \u2014 and many of them should be just as troubling. \u201cAll kinds of groups are treating communication as a ritual, and they all want to empower their own narratives,\u201d says Derakhshan. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at one fraction of them now.\u201d\n"}
