{"title": "Internal Apple presentation on how to handle leaks gets leaked", "content": " \nThe Outline recently obtained an hour-long audio recording from an internal briefing at Apple titled \u201cStopping Leakers - Keeping Confidential at Apple.\u201d The presentation, held for about 100 people, was led by three members of Apple\u2019s Global Security division: director of global security David Rice, director of worldwide investigations Lee Freedman, and Jenny Hubbert, from the Global Security communications and training team.\nAs detailed by The Outline, the audio describes the lengths Apple goes to in order to keep information about new products out of the hands of leakers, competitors, and the press. The Global Security team tasked with this includes previous members from the NSA, the US military, the FBI, and the US Secret Service.\nRice speaks about the various ways workers try to steal parts, including flushing them down a toilet to collect later in a sewer and throwing them over fences. In one of the more outlandish schemes, Rice says, \u201cWe had 8,000 enclosures stolen a long time ago by women putting it in the underwire of their bra.\u201d\n\u201c8,000 enclosures [were] stolen a long time ago by women putting it in the underwire of their bra.\u201d\nThe workers are tempted by payments that can exceed what they make in several months. Rice says they\u2019ve seen cases where up to a year\u2019s salary has been offered in reward for stealing parts. According to a 2016 report from China Labor Watch, Apple workers on the production line make about $350 USD a month.\nThe most valuable thing to steal is usually the device\u2019s housing or enclosure, which often ends up in Shenzhen\u2019s electronics market. Rice says in 2013 Apple had to buy back 29,000 total enclosures ahead of the iPhone 5C announcement in order to \u201ckeep it out of every blog on Earth.\u201d\nThese are now severe exceptions, according to Rice, something he notes as an exceptional accomplishment given the company screens upwards of 3 million people a day coming in and out of their overseas factories. In 2016, Rice says Apple produced 65 million housings, with only four stolen: a one in 16 million loss ratio.\nAccording to The Outline report, the overseas leaks have been handled so successfully that now Apple is turning the focus on their own campuses in California. \u201cLast year was the first year that Apple [campuses] leaked more than the supply chain,\u201d Rice says in the audio. \u201cMore stuff came out of Apple [campuses] last year than all of our supply chain combined.\u201d\nTwo US leakers mentioned include one who worked at Apple\u2019s online store, and another who worked on iTunes. Both were providing information to blogs, and though their motivations were not mentioned, Rice says of US leakers, \u201cWe oftentimes get people who are really excited about our products and they end up finding something to share and they will go out and say, \u2018Hey, guess what we did.' Or somebody will ask them a question and instead of just saying, \u2018I can't talk about it,\u2019 they will say too much.\u201d\nThough Apple\u2019s Global Security team says it has been able to slow the occurrence of leaks, they still happen. In April, an unverified schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked, and this month, leaks were provided by three alleged Foxconn employees ahead of WWDC with details on products like the HomePod.\n"}
