{"title": "Christian Koenigsegg thinks he built the \u2018perfect winter car\u2019", "content": " \nLiving in Colorado, I know a lot about driving in the snow. I have Nokian Hakkapeliitta studded winter tires for both my cars, and they allow my front-wheel drive vehicles to competently handle winter weather. Install high-quality winter tires on a car and it\u2019s astonishing how well they can perform. Christian Koenigsegg, founder of Swedish supercar maker Koenigsegg, agrees. \n\u201cOur owners drove [their] cars over the Alps in terrible weather to get here,\u201d Koenigsegg said to the Top Gear website at the Geneva Motor Show this week. \u201cOne of the drivers was on brand new winter tires, and many SUVs with winter tires were getting stuck and sitting there with their hazards on, but our car was good in the snow.\u201d\nA number of countries mandate the use of winter tires, meaning supercar owners who wish to drive their cars during the colder months \u2014 even when it\u2019s not snowing \u2014 need to get winter tires fitted to their massive rims. Pirelli Sottozeros are popular; they are the tires fitted to the Koenigsegg Agera RS in the video above.\nthe idea of a 1,160-horsepower hypercar driving in a snowstorm is hilarious\nStarting around the eight-minute mark, the video shows the $2 million Agera driving through a winter storm in the Alps with absolutely no problem. Though it\u2019s hilarious to see an 1,160-horsepower hypercar driving through the snow, it\u2019s also totally awesome \u2014 and, it seems, Koenigsegg agrees.\n\u201cAs long as you have winter tires, they\u2019re light, the grip-to-weight ratio is very good, the traction control and ESP is good, the centre of gravity makes it easy to control,\u201d Koenigsegg told Top Gear about his cars. \u201cIn my mind, a Koenigsegg is a perfect winter car. You might need to lift the car for better ground clearance, of course, but because we have front and rear lift systems, we have better ground clearance than most supercars. The car should be fully useable.\u201d\nIf you can\u2019t enjoy a car, Koenigsegg said, \u201cit\u2019s basically useless.\u201d\n"}
