 Tickets for Star Wars: The Last Jedi were supposed to go on sale tonight, following the premiere of a new trailer during Monday Night Football, but it seems that Showcase Cinemas is jumping the gun. CNET is reporting that tickets to the anticipated sequel are available now through the theater company’s mobile iOS and Android app. The Verge has confirmed that The Last Jedi tickets are currently available from Showcase, with screenings starting at 7PM on December 14th — a day before the “actual” release date on December 15th. It’s not clear how, or if, Showcase will continue to keep sales open, or even if it will honor the early sales. But if you’re planning on seeing The Last Jedi when it opens on at a Showcase theater, it can’t hurt to buy tickets now.
