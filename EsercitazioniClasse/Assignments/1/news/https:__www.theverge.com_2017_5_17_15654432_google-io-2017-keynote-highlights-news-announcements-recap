{"title": "The 10 biggest announcements from Google I/O 2017", "content": " \nGoogle just concluded its I/O 2017 keynote, where executives led by CEO Sundar Pichai laid out the company\u2019s future roadmap for Android, Google Assistant, Google Home, virtual reality, and much more. \nSkydiving Google Glass-wearers, giant phone giveaways, and major hardware announcements no longer rule Google\u2019s biggest annual conference. Instead, the company has settled into a pattern of releasing information about what it\u2019s doing (and what it wants to do) for developers at I/O, instead of trying to wow consumers or the press. \nYou might call that boring, but that\u2019s also a misguided notion, because there was much to glean from Pichai and the rest of the Googlers who presented onstage. So here are the 10 most important takeaways from today\u2019s I/O keynote.  \n\nAndroid surpasses 2 billion monthly active devices\nAndroid\u2019s mobile dominance hasn\u2019t stopped growing. CEO Sundar Pichai revealed at the keynote\u2019s start that the tally of monthly active Android devices now exceeds 2 billion. That includes smartphones, tablets, Android Wear devices, Android TVs, and any other number of other gadgets that are based on the operating system. \nGoogle Assistant can see and understand the world around you\nGoogle Assistant can now analyze the world around you with the help of your smartphone camera. Using a technology the company calls Google Lens, the Assistant will analyze your surroundings and display relevant content on your screen. You\u2019ll see a restaurant\u2019s rating when pointing your phone at the storefront, you can aim it at a flower and it will identify the species, and you can even pull up a band\u2019s music or videos by pointing Lens at a concert poster. But the most useful example might be this: if you point Lens at Wi-Fi login credentials, your Android phone will be able to use that info to log on to that network. (Thank you, Google.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s not the first company to try to add artificial intelligence to a smartphone\u2019s camera. Samsung recently launched \u201cBixby Vision\u201d on the Galaxy S8, a sight-based version of its own Bixby digital assistant, for example. And Snapchat (and now Instagram) are using low-level AI to apply goofy filters to your face. But Google\u2019s offering much more with Lens than just image recognition, shopping, or face filters. And while Facebook is exploring similar computer vision efforts, Google is trying to do it sooner than later with Lens.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant comes to iPhone\nAssistant is expanding beyond Android to iOS. Google Assistant will be a standalone app on iPhone and iPad, offering many of the same functions as what we\u2019ve seen it do on Google\u2019s own operating system. You don\u2019t have to wait long to try it, either; it\u2019s available starting today. \nGoogle Home turns into a phone\nLike Amazon, Google is turning its smart speaker into a phone. Over the coming months, all Home owners will be able to place free calls to the United States and Canada. By default, Google uses a private number for this feature \u2014 but you\u2019ve got the option of tying it to your own mobile phone number. The same goes for everyone else in your house, as phone calls support Home\u2019s multi-user setup. Only outgoing calls will be available at launch, as Google is taking a cautious approach to avoid privacy headaches. \n\nHome gets way more useful\nGoogle\u2019s smart speaker was already one of the best ones on the market, but the company announced a suite of other new features and updates beyond calling to Home that make it much more powerful. Home is now going to be able to control HBO Now, Hulu, SoundCloud, Deezer, and more. Even better, Google is opening up access to Home\u2019s Bluetooth radio, meaning you can treat it just like any other Bluetooth speaker. \nHome now acts as a phone, can connect over Bluetooth, and gets new compatibility with services like HBO and Hulu\nHome is also becoming more useful away from the device itself. Google showed off what it\u2019s calling \u201cvisual responses.\u201d Using Google Assistant, Home will now be more capable of directing the right information to the right connected screen. Say something like: \u201cOK Google, show my calendar for today\u201d and Home can instantly display your day\u2019s events on a Chromecast-connected TV. Ask Home for directions to a place or event, and it will send the directions right to the Google Maps app on your phone. \nMore than ever, this requires extreme commitment to Google\u2019s products and services, but that\u2019s sort of the point \u2014 Google is betting it can bring all this stuff together in such an attractive way that you won\u2019t think twice about buying (or ditching) your Amazon Echo.\nGoogle Photos adds books and effortless sharing\nGoogle Photos is getting a slew of great additions. The app will now recommend that you share photos you\u2019ve taken with people that it recognizes as being in the shot. Google calls this Suggested Sharing. It\u2019s also introducing Shared Libraries, which allow families to collectively add images to a central collection more easily. But Google is emphasizing control, here: you can share your entire photo library, share only from a certain date, or share photos that include certain things like your kids.\nDigital backups are great, but what if you want physical memories? Google now offers printed photo books. Books can be created directly on your smartphone. Google will even recommend books to you when it thinks a particular collection makes sense. Books are available beginning today for prices that start at only $9.99. \nAnd in the future, Google said that Photos will be able to automatically remove unwanted items in your shots \u2014 like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\nStandalone virtual reality headsets are coming\nGoogle\u2019s VR ambitions are expanding beyond Daydream\u2019s current form, which involves strapping your smartphone to your face. The company announced that upcoming headsets from partners including HTC and Lenovo won\u2019t require a smartphone or PC to power the user\u2019s VR experience. You just put it on and it works. The headsets track virtual space with something Google calls \u201cWorldSense,\u201d powered by technology from its Tango augmented reality system. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t hear exactly when this standalone vision will become reality. Google just offers a vague \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\n\nNew #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU\u2014 Google (@Google) May 17, 2017\n\n\n\nThe first Android O beta is available today\nGoogle is launching its preview program for Android O, and the first beta is being released today. We\u2019re still in the pretty early days of Android O\u2019s development, so you shouldn\u2019t install this preview on your everyday smartphone. But if you\u2019re dying to check out the big new features \u2014 improved notifications, picture-in-picture, and more \u2014 you can enroll a compatible Pixel or Nexus device and begin testing out Android O. \n\nAndroid Go is how Google will reach the \u201cnext billion\u201d users \nBringing the \u201cnext billion\u201d users online with smartphone technology has been a major focus for Pichai since he took over as Google CEO in 2015. Today, the company announced one way it\u2019s going to try to reach that goal: Android Go, a version of the mobile operating system built for entry-level devices that\u2019s optimized for being used in data-restricted environments.  \nGoogle\u2019s still going after the next billion users\nAndroid Go, which is built on Android O, comes with a \u201crebuilt\u201d set of Google apps that require less memory, storage, and data to run. Android Go also has its own version of the Google Play Store, which features apps that are best suited for the developing world (like YouTube Go). The OS is able to run on cheap smartphones with as little as 512GB of RAM or less, and Google also built in a way for carriers to show users exactly how much data they\u2019re using. Android Go is still an internal project, but Google sounded confident about it\u2019s ability to take over where 2014\u2019s Android One initiative left off. \nGoogle\u2019s new AI chip could turn the cloud into its next Android\nPichai was quick to hammer home the point that his company\u2019s future depends on artificial intelligence, specifically the machine learning techniques that let algorithms learn on their own and improve over time. This technology underpins everything from its Assistant and search to Google Photos and the AlphaGo system. During the opening remarks of the I/O keynote today, Pichai announced Google\u2019s next-generation Tensor Processing Unit, a specially designed chip for machine learning that works on the company\u2019s TensorFlow platform.\nThis new TPU chip effectively makes building AI on Google\u2019s platform incredibly fast and efficient, more so than with hardware and machine learning platforms used by competitors. With TPU and TensorFlow being optimized to work together, Google is effectively transforming its cloud computing platform into the Android for AI. This is a big deal for Google\u2019s future. If the company can own the hardware and software used by the most cutting-edge AI researchers, it can stay at the forefront of the field and have its hand in every exciting advancement that machine learning, and every other AI breakthrough, yields in the future.\n"}
