{"title": "New trailers: Mr. Robot, Marvel\u2019s Inhumans, and more", "content": " \nNot to sound like your dad, but every movie now is at least half an hour too long, right? I went to see Logan Lucky this past weekend because I guess I\u2019m an Adam Driver fan now and I needed to figure out if Daniel Craig was bald or just blond (blond, for the record). Anyway, the movie got to a point where it seemed like it was almost over, and I thought, \u201cThis was pretty good, even though Adam Driver\u2019s Southern accent was insane.\u201d But then, it turns out, the movie wasn\u2019t over yet, and there was this whole secondary plot. So by the time I left the theater I was mostly thinking, \u201cMan, that movie was too long.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been thinking that a lot recently, and for all the faults some trailers have (they ruin all the good jokes, make good movies look bad), at least they\u2019re not too long. Here are eight from this week.\n\nWormwood\nWormwood is Errol Morris\u2019 first docuseries for Netflix. It\u2019s a six-parter that explores the CIA\u2019s experiments with LSD and mind control in the 1950s. Specifically, it focuses on the true story of two brothers who filed a lawsuit against the CIA in 2012 alleging that their father\u2019s death was not an accident, and was actually a CIA cover-up. \nIt lands on Netflix on December 15th.\n\n\nInhumans\nMarvel\u2019s Inhumans series has not been getting great reviews. The Guardian said it was \u201cdestined to be the TV disaster of the year.\u201d Well, we needed one eventually, and we\u2019re running out of time! \nThe episodes will air on ABC beginning September 29th.\n\nLore\nLore is inspired by Aaron Mahnke\u2019s podcast of the same name. It\u2019s a six-episode animated series that will focus on different urban legends and horror stories. News reports and historical footage will also be used to make the stories even creepier.\nIt will debut on Amazon Prime Video on October 13th.\n\nMindhunter\nAn adaptation of the 1996 nonfiction book, Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI\u2019s Elite Serial Crime Unit, Netflix\u2019s Mindhunter follows two FBI agents (played by Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) in 1979, who help track serial killers by understanding how they think. \nIt premieres on October 13th. \n\nBrawl in Cell Block 99\nBrawl in Cell Block 99, directed by S. Craig Zahler (Bone Tomahawk), stars Vince Vaughn as a mechanic-turned-drug-runner who eventually ends up in prison. Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy? When will his hair grow back?\nIt premieres on October 6th.\n\nBlade of the Immortal\nJapanese director Takashi Miike takes on Blade of the Immortal, an adaptation of Hiroaki Samura manga series. The trailer is violent and bloody \u2014 if you\u2019re looking for some fight scenes, here ya go. \nIt\u2019s set for wide release in the US on November 3rd. \n\nDownsizing\nMatt Damon, Christoph Waltz, Jason Sudeikis, and Kristin Wiig star in Alexander Payne\u2019s Downsizing, a movie about a man trying to shrink himself, apparently so that his problems (and the problem of Earth\u2019s limited resources) will also shrink.\nIt\u2019s set for a December 22nd release date.\n\nMr. Robot\nUSA\u2019s Mr. Robot is coming back for a third season soon, and it looks like we can expect to see Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) recovering from last season\u2019s events and fsociety struggling with a whole new set of problems.\nMr. Robot comes back on October 11th.\n"}
