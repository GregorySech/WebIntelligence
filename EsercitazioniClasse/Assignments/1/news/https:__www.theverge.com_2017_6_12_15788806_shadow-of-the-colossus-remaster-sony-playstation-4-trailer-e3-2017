{"title": "Shadow of the Colossus remaster will let you scale great beasts on PlayStation 4", "content": " \nSony will release a remake of SCE Japan Studio\u2019s action-adventure game Shadow of the Colossus in 2018. The news was announced on-stage today at Sony\u2019s E3 press conference with a brief trailer. \nShadow of the Colossus originally launched for PlayStation 2 in 2005 as a spiritual successor to Ico. It was directed by Fumito Ueda, the developer behind The Last Guardian. Shadow of the Colossus is an epic, yet minimalist game that has no dungeons, characters to engage with, or real dialogue. Instead, it plays out through a series of grand battles against giant beasts known as colossi. It\u2019s part adventure, part puzzle as players hunt down colossi and figure out how to best slay these monumental beasts. \n\n\nIt's happening. pic.twitter.com/9KpvZc2onP\u2014 PlayStation (@PlayStation) June 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\n"}
