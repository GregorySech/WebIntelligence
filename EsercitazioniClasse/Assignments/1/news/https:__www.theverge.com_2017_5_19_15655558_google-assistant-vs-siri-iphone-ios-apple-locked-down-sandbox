{"title": "How does Google Assistant stack up against Siri on an iPhone?", "content": " \nSome of the biggest news to come out of Google I/O this week was that Google Assistant is coming to iOS, looking to take a shot at Siri, Apple\u2019s own entrenched AI assistant. While Assistant has been available on Android for a while now, how does the AI assistant stack up against Siri when its forced to go head-to-head on Apple\u2019s far more limited playing field? We put the two head-to-head.\nAccess\nOne of the most important parts of any AI assistant is how easy it is to access. One of the biggest selling points of Amazon\u2019s Echo hardware is the always-listening feature that lets Alexa always be on hand to respond to any queries or commands. On Android, Assistant has deep, OS-level hooks that make it more more accessible and functional. But on iOS, things are a little tougher.\nSiri: On Apple\u2019s hardware, Siri still has a massive home court advantage when it comes to actually starting the digital assistant. Namely, Siri is baked into iOS on a core level \u2014 its accessible from anywhere, whether you\u2019re in an app or at your lock-screen by simply holding down the home button. Siri is also always listening, too, and can be activated anytime through a \u201cHey, Siri\u201d command on newer iPhones (although the feature, like much of Siri these days, feels largely half-baked.)\nAssistant: Google is making a big play here with Assistant, but it\u2019s fighting an uphill battle here with the inherent limitations Apple has on iOS. That means that Assistant lives in the Assistant app. But Google is doing its best to put Assistant in as many places as possible: there\u2019s an Assistant widget to quick launch the app, which is accessible from both the notification shade, the lock screen, and the home screen. Plus, there\u2019s a 3D Touch action to also start Assistant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware integration\nUnlike when Siri first launched back in 2011, AI assistants can\u2019t just work with a single device anymore. Working on an iPhone is one thing \u2014 but working across an entire ecosystem is a whole other ballgame. \nSiri: The best thing that can be said about Apple\u2019s assistant is that it exists on a variety of hardware platforms. If you\u2019ve got an Apple Watch, a Mac, or an Apple TV, you can use Siri on it, but that\u2019s about the extent of it. Siri on different platforms largely exist as separate things \u2014 you can\u2019t use the native Siri on your iPhone to play a song on your Apple TV, for example, or use Siri on your Apple TV to make a call.  \nControlling smart home utilities with Siri only works if manufacturers support Apple\u2019s HomeKit, and you\u2019ll need either an Apple TV or iPad to serve as a hub. Plus, you\u2019re still locked strictly to Apple\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 if Cupertino doesn\u2019t make hardware for it (like, say, an Amazon Echo-like speaker), then you can\u2019t use Siri on it. \nAssistant: Obviously, just like Siri works with Apple stuff, Assistant works with Google stuff. That means Chromecast, Android phones, and of course, Google Home. But one of the announcements to Assistant at I/O was that third-party hardware manufacturers would be able to integrate Assistant into their own devices, which means that there could be a much larger ecosystem for Assistant in the near future. \nGoogle also showed off how Assistant can work across multiple devices \u2014 using a Chromecast to display visual results from a Google Home, suggesting a more universal experience than Siri. How that will work in practice is still somewhat unclear, given that the feature doesn\u2019t seem to be available yet (at least through Assistant on an iPhone.) But it speaks to Google\u2019s larger ambitions of having a unified Assistant platform across all devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctionality:  \nOf course, an assistant is only useful if it can actually assist you with things. And at this point, there's basic table stakes that both platforms are able to accomplish \u2014 basic queries of the weather and sports scores, calendar reminders, alarms, etc. That said, there are clear differences between the two in terms of the extent of their abilities.\nSiri: Siri is able to do more advanced queries like tell you the time difference between two cities or what the price of gasoline is in San Fransisco, typically drawing on resources like Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to answer, but in practice I\u2019ve generally find it easier and more reliable to just Google the question.\nAnd most of Siri's functional advantages \u2014 things like opening up apps or sending iMessages \u2014 stem from the aforementioned platform advantage than any intrinsic usefulness to Siri itself. \nAssistant: Even with the limitations of iOS, Assistant gets a lot done. You can play videos in YouTube, add reminders and events through Google Calendar, and send emails through Gmail. Plus, there\u2019s the usual AI assistant queries of stocks, the weather, and maps that\u2019s common to both Siri and Assistant. Google has also tried its best to offer messaging and call support on iOS, but it can only get so far \u2014 both will get you 99 percent of the way there before passing you back to Apple\u2019s apps for actually sending the message or placing a call. Meanwhile, things like setting an alarm just aren\u2019t possible with Assistant on iOS, and others \u2014 like playing music, which shunts you over to YouTube \u2014 work, but are a bit of a hack.\nGoogle it can only get so far on iOS\nBut even putting aside those similarities, Assistant has the entire power of Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph behind it, which means that the breadth of information it can answer is wider than Siri\u2019s. Also, Assistant just seems to work better in my experience when it comes to both understanding words and responding quickly. \nThat said, some of the more impressive features of Assistant from Google I/O simply aren\u2019t here yet. The impressive Google Lens augmented reality camera, or even simpler demos like the interactive Panera order seen on stage aren\u2019t part of the app yet.  \nDeveloper support\nAmazon has really led the way with developer supporter when it comes to Alexa, with over 10,000 different third-party skills available. Siri and Assistant both have some third-party support, but both companies could stand to take a page from Amazon's book here. \nSiri: Apple finally added third-party developer support for Siri with iOS 10, but it's still limited \u2014 developers can\u2019t make Siri integrations for mapping or music apps, an intentional limitation that forces you to use Apple\u2019s own Music and Maps services, even if you prefer Google and Spotify. Developers for Siri extensions are instead limited to seven categories of integration: ride book, messaging, photo search, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and climate and radio. So even if you\u2019d wanted to build a Siri extension to play Jeopardy or tell you how many people are in space right now, you can\u2019t. \nAssistant: Google also took things slowly when it came to building out Google Assistant and Google Home's third-party abilities, but at I/O this year it opened the door for developers to make extensions for Assistant on both Home and phones. Plus, those actions won\u2019t be targeted to specific devices \u2014 rather, if your hardware can support the skill (which could, say, require a screen to function), it\u2019ll be able to access it. But it\u2019s up to developers to actually build out the ecosystem.   \nTask completion\nAnswering questions and search is only half the equation, though. AIs also need to be able to actively do things for you, make your life easier. Neither platform is outstanding at this yet, but it\u2019s definitely something to keep an eye on in the future both digital assistants continue to mature. \nSiri: Siri is a mixed bag when it comes to actually accomplishing tasks for you. In theory, you can look up restaurant reservations or movie times through OpenTable or Fandango, but it will still fall on you to actually complete the task yourself. Other things, like booking an Uber can be done entirely through Siri, as can sending money through Square Cash or Venmo, but that\u2019s pretty much as far as it can go. \nAssistant: Like Siri, Assistant is also limited when it comes to actually doing things for you, at least for now, and some things that Siri can do \u2014 like summon an Uber \u2014 aren\u2019t on Assistant for now. But, as mentioned before, Google has high hopes for what can eventually be done with assistant, like sending flowers or ordering lunch, but right now things are still extremely limited on an iPhone. But if Google (and the third party developers it needs to jump on board) can actually ship some of the integrations shown off at I/O this year, Assistant could get a huge leg up on Siri. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly comparing any third party AI assistant \u2014 whether from Google, Microsoft, or another company \u2014 to Siri is always going to be a tough proposition, given how locked down iOS is on a system level and Apple\u2019s tight control over the platform. \nSiri \u2014 while still not great \u2014 is good enough for now\nAs things stand right now, between Siri\u2019s advantages when it comes to native integration to things like messaging and music, along with the system-wide availability that makes it accessible at any time means that in most cases, it\u2019s easier to use Apple\u2019s assistant. While Assistant does clearly best Siri when it comes to overall knowledge and support for Google services, (including Maps) the current implementation just isn\u2019t so dramatically better at these tasks that it\u2019s worth the extra inconvenience of working around Apple\u2019s sandboxing. \nThat said, Google does have some seriously impressive ambitions for Assistant that could shift the scales in its favor. But those features aren\u2019t here yet, and for what Assistant can do on iOS now, Siri \u2014 while not great \u2014 is good enough. \n"}
