{"title": "Comic-Con 2017 preview: superheroes and TV shows take on San Diego", "content": " \nSan Diego Comic-Con is right around the corner, and fans from all over the world will be descending on America's Finest City \u2014 yes, that\u2019s the actual nickname for San Diego \u2014 for all the latest news from the biggest pop culture event of the year. \nAlmost all the big players from fantasy, science fiction, and superhero movies and TV shows are putting in at least some kind of appearance this year. There\u2019ll be news from Marvel, updates from DC, reveals from 20th Century Fox, and tons of TV shows all jockeying for your attention with casting announcements, producer panels, and flashy new trailers. The fireworks kick off on July 20th, but to tide you over until then, we\u2019ve rounded up all the big news we\u2019re expecting to see out of Comic-Con this year. Dive on in below: \nMarvel\nThor and more\nMarvel made an appearance at Disney\u2019s D23 Expo last week, premiering the first footage from the hugely anticipated Avengers: Infinity War, and there\u2019s a decent chance that trailer will be making a more public appearance at the studio\u2019s Hall H panel. Additionally, there\u2019s Thor: Ragnarok, set to release this fall. It skipped Disney\u2019s show entirely, so it\u2019s likely Marvel was saving its appearance for Comic-Con. \nBeyond that, the studio has its next few years of movies planned between Black Panther, Ant-Man & The Wasp, and the as-yet-untitled fourth Avengers movie, any of which could get new trailers, casting announcements, or news (or, in the case of Avengers 4, an actual title). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the TV front, Marvel will have several of its shows at Comic-Con. Expect to see a trailer for Netflix\u2019s Defenders series before it hits in August, the upcoming ABC show Inhumans, Fox\u2019s The Gifted, and more information on Legion\u2019s second season \u2014 all at their respective panels. \n\nDC Comics\nA new Justice League trailer is all but guaranteed\nDC\u2019s movies are all bundled into the main Warner Bros. panel, and coming off the blockbuster success of Wonder Woman, expect DC to build off that momentum as it begins its marketing blitz for Justice League and other DC Extended Universe movies set for farther down the line. With the DC team-up fast approaching this November, a new trailer is all but guaranteed, which could also mean an appearance by director / cult hero Joss Whedon. The writer-director took the reins of the film after Zack Snyder stepped down to deal with a personal loss, and the fact that most Comic-Con audiences would willingly offer blood sacrifice in Whedon\u2019s name is probably a good incentive for Warner Bros. to bring him out.\nWe\u2019ll probably get a first look at Aquaman, which is currently filming, too. Also likely on the agenda: an announcement of a Wonder Woman sequel with Patty Jenkins returning to direct, which has been rumored for the last few weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice League\n\n\nAfter Aquaman, though, DC\u2019s schedule looks pretty murky: Warner Bros. has tons of DC superhero films in the pipeline, but none of them are actually actively in production. That said, we\u2019ll hopefully get updates on some of the many, many films the studio has in the works, a list that includes, but isn\u2019t limited to, Shazam, Cyborg, Green Lantern Corps, The Flash, The Batman, Suicide Squad 2, Gotham City Sirens, and Whedon\u2019s Batgirl film.  \nThe TV side of things is clearer for DC, with previews of its returning CW shows (Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow) along with a better look at the new series Black Lightning. Fox\u2019s Gotham will also have a panel, and SyFy is expected to show a first trailer for its Superman prequel show, Krypton. \nWarner Bros.\nWarner Bros. doesn\u2019t only have DC movies in the pipeline. Its Comic-Con panel will almost certainly include more news on Blade Runner 2049 and the Stephen King adaptation It. Also expected are first looks at Steven Spielberg\u2019s upcoming adaptation of Ernest Cline\u2019s Ready Player One, Roar Uthaug\u2019s Tomb Raider reboot, and the star-studded Ocean\u2019s Eight \u2014 all of which could get trailer premieres. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady Player One\nPhoto: Entertainment Weekly\n\n\n20th Century Fox\n20th Century Fox isn\u2019t saying what to expect at its Comic-Con panel, but it does have a block of time booked off in Hall H, so there\u2019s almost guaranteed to be news. That could mean more details on upcoming films, like Murder on the Orient Express and Kingsman: The Golden Circle; additional info on the very full slate of 2018 X-Men movies: Deadpool 2, New Mutants, and X-Men: Dark Phoenix; or even a first look at the upcoming Predator reboot and the long-awaited adaptation of Alita: Battle Angel. Who knows? The studio might even have something new up its sleeve. \nStar Wars\nWe\u2019re not expecting too much Star Wars news from Disney and Lucasfilm. There\u2019s no panel scheduled for Comic-Con, and given that there was just a new behind-the-scenes video last week, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll be getting any more news from a galaxy far, far away until later this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: CBS\n\n\nStar Trek\nCBS is holding a panel for Star Trek: Discovery, which is set to arrive this fall. We got a first look at the new Star Trek show earlier this year, but with Discovery set to premiere in September and plenty of warning flags, the new series has a long way to go to win back fan trust. A good showing at Comic-Con would definitely be a good step forward there. \nNetflix\nNetflix is increasingly a juggernaut when it comes to original movies and TV shows, and it\u2019s bringing some big names to Comic-Con. The streaming service is showing off two films in San Diego this year: the gritty, Will Smith fantasy cop movie Bright, and the upcoming live-action of the classic anime Death Note. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStranger Things, Season 2\n\n\nAs for the TV front, there should be plenty more on last year\u2019s surprise hit Stranger Things, which returns to Netflix for a second season this fall. \nHBO\nGame of Thrones takes a victory lap\nHBO is running a Game of Thrones panel, but with the show\u2019s seventh season already in swing, expect this to be more of a victory lap for the fantasy epic. That said, HBO is said to be developing no less than five different ideas for possible prequel series, which could get announced at the panel. And there\u2019s always the outside change that George R.R. Martin may have finally finished the next volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. A big Comic-Con panel would be the perfect place to announce The Winds of Winter (although that\u2019s probably wishful thinking on my part).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHBO\n\n\nAlso making an appearance is Westworld, where we should be getting news about the show\u2019s upcoming second season. While it might be too early for a trailer, hopefully HBO will at least give us a release date so we\u2019ll know when we\u2019re returning to the violent delights of the world\u2019s most murderous amusement park. \nTwin Peaks\nIt\u2019s been a... strange run, Twin Peaks. The cult classic returned with a limited run series earlier this year on Showtime, but enthusiasm quickly turned into befuddled confusion over the increasingly meandering wackiness the revived show has put on display. With Game of Thrones now firmly back in the Sunday night spotlight, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what Twin Peaks has to offer at Comic-Con, especially with a prestigious Hall H booking for its panel. \nDoctor Who\nThe Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con will feature long-serving showrunner Steven Moffat and actor Peter Capaldi, who\u2019s played the 12th incarnation of the Doctor over the last few years, saving goodbye to the sci-fi series. We\u2019ll probably get a preview of the upcoming Christmas special (the final episode for both Moffat and Capaldi), but considering the recent announcement of Jodie Whittaker as the incumbent Thirteenth Doctor, there\u2019s a chance that she could show up as a surprise guest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTV continues its Comic-Con dominance\nIn addition to the aforementioned shows, there\u2019s still a ton of other series that will be making appearances at the convention, which has become dominated by television in recent years. The Walking Dead, Rick & Morty, Preacher, Mr. Robot, The Orville, The Magicians, The Expanse, and The Simpsons are just a few of the shows that will have a presence, and they could be bringing news, footage, and other surprises with them.\nVirtual reality and brand activations\nOne of the more interesting things we\u2019re expecting to see at Comic-Con this year is a doubling down on VR and immersive events. With exclusive movie trailers no longer the lure they once were, studios and networks have continued to invest in unique, in-person experiences as a way to engage their fans. We\u2019re expecting to see a wide array of installations and activations, ranging from a re-created Westworld, a Microsoft HoloLens experience for Legion, a Blade Runner VR experience, and a mystery scavenger hunt tied to Mr. Robot \u2014 all of which should put a different spin on the usual convention-going experience.   \n"}
