{"title": "Hulu proves that the Switch is a perfectly good streaming gadget", "content": " \nThis week, Nintendo added a new app to its eStore for the Switch: Hulu. It\u2019s the first major media app to arrive for the device, and it helps to demonstrate the Switch\u2019s potential beyond gaming. \nWhen I picked up my Switch earlier this year, I quickly became a fan of how portable the device was: it\u2019s lighter than its predecessor, the Wii U\u2019s GamePad, and moves seamlessly between living room and anywhere else I\u2019ve brought it. My TV habits \u2014 like many others \u2014 aren\u2019t limited to the living room. I\u2019ve got the Netflix app on my iPhone and iPad, and those are used everywhere the TV isn\u2019t: I\u2019ll frequently throw something on one of those while I\u2019m working around the house, cooking, or eating lunch. But my iPad is one of the original ones, and it\u2019s getting old. And while the Switch\u2019s screen isn\u2019t that much bigger than my iPhone 8 Plus, the slightly larger size is noticeable. One downside of watching TV from your phone is also that it\u2019s not all that uncommon to get a push notification while I\u2019m watching something.\nSince I\u2019ve added Hulu to my Switch, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s an ideal device for watching the various shows that I\u2019m working to catch up on. My wife and I often watch something during dinner, and while we don\u2019t usually take 40 minutes to eat, the Switch\u2019s design makes it stupidly easy to dock and start back up, without having to fire up another device, and another app. The Switch\u2019s Hulu app itself works decently \u2014 it\u2019s fairly responsive, though it has frozen up on me a couple of times. The UI is similar to the Xbox and iOS apps. If there\u2019s any downside to the app, it\u2019s that you need both Joy-Con controllers to make it work \u2014 the touch screen doesn\u2019t work here. Obviously, battery life is an issue here, too. You can use the Switch to watch a couple of episodes, but it\u2019s not exactly something I\u2019d use out of the house, say, on a long road trip.\nMy colleague Ashley Carman opined the other day that the Switch\u2019s kickstand is bad, and I would agree with her when it comes to gaming. But using the Switch as a streaming device, where I don\u2019t actually have to touch it or use the controllers, is where the kickstand redeems itself. It props the device up at the right angle to watch, especially when I\u2019m standing at a counter or sitting at a table. \nThe Switch as a streaming device, in addition to gaming, is a natural next step. Although only Hulu is available now, it shouldn\u2019t be long until other apps like Netflix make their way onto the device, which will make the Switch an even more powerful entertainment gadget. \n"}
