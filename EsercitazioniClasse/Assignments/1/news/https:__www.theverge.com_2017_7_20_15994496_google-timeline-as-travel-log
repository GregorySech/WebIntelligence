{"title": "My favorite travel logging app is also Google\u2019s most controversial feature", "content": " \nIt\u2019s summer in the northern hemisphere, which means it\u2019s a popular time for people to get outside more, go on vacations, and \u2014 if you\u2019re obsessed with the internet \u2014 chronicle just about everything you\u2019re doing. Facebook and Instagram have evolved from social networks to time capsules of our lives, but they\u2019re slowly losing popularity as young people move away from Facebook and keep fewer photos on Instagram. But that\u2019s ok because I found a better solution.\nLast month I went on a long weekend trip with my girlfriends. It was our first travel together eons, so it was something I wanted to log. But I also didn\u2019t want to spend time actively writing things down in order to maximize my time engaged with the group. For years, I\u2019ve resorted to jotting places I went each day into my Google Calendar, as that\u2019ll usually trigger memories of time spent there. Alas, our days were so packed I wouldn\u2019t have had time to do any logging anyway.\nWhen I got back I still wanted to fill out my calendar, so I went through my Google Maps location history to get a refresher on where we went. As it turned out, my recorded location history was exactly the kind of background travel logging I was looking for.\nWhen traveling in a new city, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be using Google Maps to get around, so it was neat to see each day laid out in a timeline, from how long we waited for a table for brunch to how much time I spent on the road driving us to a hike. It also brought in geotagged photos I took, appropriately illustrating how each day unfolded.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to think that I have a pretty good photographic memory, so when I see that Google noted that we left the Spice & Tea Exchange store at 5:59PM, I\u2019m able to recall how we ran back to the car frantically thinking we needed to refill the meter, only to learn that in Asheville, metered parking is free after 6PM. It\u2019s instances like these that jog the silly memories, reminding me of the time spent with my friends captured in tiny moments.\nAnd while it\u2019s definitely fair to feel creeped out by the amount of data Google has about where you go, how long you\u2019ve been there, and what photos you take, I\u2019ve come to accept that this is what I\u2019ve agreed to in exchange for a \u201cfree\u201d service. Information about places I\u2019ve visited is not that personal to me, but I can understand why others would not want Google to be passively tracking their whereabouts in the background. \nMaybe Google Timeline isn\u2019t for you, but for me, having a device that goes everywhere I do is an easy way to create an automatic album of my travels. You can also opt in for Timeline only when you\u2019re traveling.\nWhatever your thoughts are, at least this much is true: whatever is recorded in your Timeline is what\u2019s authentic and it\u2019s what truly happened. And that\u2019s a lot more than I can say about travel logging on Instagram.\n"}
