{"title": "A robot is burning every one of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets so you don\u2019t have to", "content": " \nDonald Trump\u2019s tweets seem to provide some catharsis for the man himself, allowing him to work out some anger at Hillary Clinton, leakers inside his own administration, and FAKE NEWS. But each one is also an opportunity for his opponents to work out their own frustrations, quoting and replying to his messages with their own sick burns. \nIt\u2019s difficult, though, given how often Trump tweets, to think of witty replies to each of his wild statements. That\u2019s where new Twitter account @burnedyourtweet comes in. The account replies to each Trump tweet with a short video showing a robot printing the tweet out and grabbing it with a claw, before setting it on fire and dumping it in an ashtray. \n\n\n.@RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/XESBxMncNv\u2014 Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nThe account is just getting started, but if the president keeps up his tweet schedule, then someone\u2019s going to need to change the ashtray pretty often. It\u2019s not clear who that would be \u2014 nobody has claimed the machine as yet \u2014 although it has got the seal of approval from the internet\u2019s queen of shitty robots. Perhaps it simply coalesced, an artificial intelligence identifying the internet\u2019s strong need for sick Trump burns, and building a device accordingly.\n\n\n.@RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/B0f1v0FkEb\u2014 Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nThe robot also makes no direct comment on each of the tweets in the videos, but the message seems clear. The fact it\u2019s a robot doing the firestarting implies even more derision \u2014 the maker thinks so little of Trump\u2019s words that they won\u2019t even burn them manually. It\u2019s the Platonic ideal of the internet\u2019s own sick burn: a literal burning, performed by cold, calculating machine.\n"}
