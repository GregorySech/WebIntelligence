{"title": "Standalone Google VR headsets coming from HTC and Lenovo", "content": " \nGoogle is working with partners on a standalone VR headset that will support inside-out tracking. The headsets track virtual space with something Google calls \u201cWorldSense,\u201d powered by technology from its Tango augmented reality system. Google is creating a reference design with help from Qualcomm, and it\u2019s also working with HTC and Lenovo for standalone headsets.\nThere\u2019s no release date or price announced on stage, and as with Daydream last year, we\u2019re only seeing an outline of the headset \u2014 which appears alongside a Daydream-like controller. A closer look at the project, published at Backchannel, says that Google has developed a prototype and that Lenovo and HTC will release commercial versions \u201cin the coming months.\u201d It should fall in \u201cthe mid-hundreds range,\u201d apparently comparable to the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive\u2019s $600 to $700 range. Bavor has also published an essay with details on Medium.\n\nThe prototype is described as clunky, but producing a better experience than the Gear VR or Daydream. A rendering system called Seurat allows it to produce high performance with low power, dramatically optimizing 3D graphics.\nThis prototype puts Google in the company of Oculus and Intel, both of whom have showed off early standalone headsets with self-contained tracking systems. It\u2019s also similar to Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality Headset development kits with inside-out tracking. This long-rumored headset follows on the heels of Google\u2019s phone-based Daydream platform, which is also coming to more phones later this year.\n\n\nNew #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU\u2014 Google (@Google) May 17, 2017\n\n\n\n\n"}
