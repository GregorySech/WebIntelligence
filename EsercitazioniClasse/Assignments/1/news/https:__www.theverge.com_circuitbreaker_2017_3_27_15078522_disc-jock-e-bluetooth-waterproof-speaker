{"title": "This could be you enjoying a flying Bluetooth speaker disc", "content": " \nLast week I wrote about a new toy called Thumb Chucks. As far as I can tell, they haven\u2019t taken off. Today I come to you with another toy: the Disc Jock-e. It\u2019s a Frisbee that doubles as a waterproof Bluetooth speaker. As much as I want to hate on this invention, I can\u2019t deny it kind of makes sense? I\u2019m not one for beach sports, I\u2019m more of a lounger \u2014 but I understand that some people enjoy being active when outside. Those people likely want to listen to music, too. Why not use a Bluetooth disc? It would just be a shame if you had to throw it when the beat drops or the chorus is coming up. \nThis could be you:\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure what that app they\u2019re using in the commercial is and whether the Disc Jock-e is actually trying to sell us on some sort of music subscription service. I really hope that\u2019s not the case. Either way, Bluetooth works across device so you shouldn\u2019t have to subscribe to any questionable apps to live your flying speaker dreams.\n"}
