{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s custom Chainsmokers Xbox One S is designed for your inner EDM bro", "content": " \nIn the event that you happen to be in the market for an offensive piece of living room electronics, Microsoft has teamed up with DJ duo The Chainsmokers to design a one-of-a-kind Xbox One S console that turns sound into an \u201cever-changing dynamic light show.\u201d In the true spirit of edgier-than-thou game industry accessorizing, the device is tackier than the most egregious light-up Razer peripheral. \nMicrosoft used 60 miniature pixels to illuminate a multi-layered acrylic display, all powered by a tiny USB-sized microprocessor the company had custom-built for the project. It essentially transforms your Xbox into a multi-colored strobe light you\u2019d find blinding you in the middle of night club, one you may not want to be at because... well, perhaps the DJ is earnestly playing a Chainsmokers song. Microsoft plans to gift the console to one fan who participates in the giveaway on the band\u2019s Twitter account starting today through September 17th. \nNormally, this kind of flagrant marketing display wouldn\u2019t be all that interesting \u2014 especially not with an artist as anodyne and eager-to-please as The Chainsmokers \u2014 except that Microsoft says it plans to continue producing custom Xbox One S consoles in partnership with a \u201ctop personalities from music, sports, television, fashion, art and Hollywood.\u201d While a DJ-inspired Xbox One S that lights up like an off-brand Amazon disco ball is nothing special, one could imagine some pretty neat device concepts for professional athletes or other musicians with a bit more of a refined visual aesthetic. \n"}
