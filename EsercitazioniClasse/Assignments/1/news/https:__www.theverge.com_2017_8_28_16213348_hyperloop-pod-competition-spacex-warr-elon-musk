The teams were tasked with developing a prototype pod to travel down a 1.2-kilometer (0.75-mile) tube, as part of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u2019s vision for a Hyperloop high-speed transport system. The pod that reached the highest maximum speed would be crowned the winner. \n\n\nHyperloop pod run by team WARR pic.twitter.com/ntaMsoxkZE\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 28, 2017\n\n\n\nWARR\u2019s prototype, a lightweight, carbon-fiber pod, comfortably beat submissions from the two other teams, whose members hailed from Switzerland, Canada and the US. The 176-pound WARR pod is powered by a 50kW electric motor and features four pneumatic friction brakes that allow the pod to come to a standstill within five seconds, according to the team\u2019s website. \nThe team from Munich Technical University also won the prize for fastest pod at the first Hyperloop Pod competition in January, when its prototype reached a speed of 58 mph. Musk congratulated WARR in a tweet on Sunday, adding in a subsequent tweet that it may be possible to reach \u201csupersonic\u201d speeds in the test Hyperloop tube.   \n \n\n"}
