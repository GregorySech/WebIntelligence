{"title": "Amazon will pay more developers who make popular Alexa skills", "content": " \nAmazon says it will now pay developers who make Alexa skills with the highest engagements in the US, UK, and Germany. Alexa skills are feature commands you can say to Amazon\u2019s digital assistant such as, \u201cAlexa, ask Fitbit how I\u2019m doing today,\u201d or \u201cAlexa, I\u2019m bored,\u201d which in turn launches the corresponding voice-activated app.  \nDevelopers began getting paid for Alexa skills in the games, trivia, and accessories category in May. Amazon has now expanded payment to include those developing skills in education and reference, food and drink, health and fitness, lifestyle, music, audio, and productivity. Developers can\u2019t charge for skills, and so far there\u2019s no indication of how they\u2019re paid. Amazon says payment depends on the amount of engagement a skill receives. One developer was paid $133, according to TechCrunch, but there was no breakdown of why that amount \u2014 which seems quite arbitrary \u2014 was chosen.\n\u201cAlexa, I\u2019m bored.\u201d\nAmazon says the most engaging skills available for Alexa are designed voice-first, are unique, and make life easier. The company cites Dog Feeder as a unique skill; it helps customers find out if their dog has been fed recently. Those that involve exercise workouts, daily affirmations, or translations can also be popular, with many customers using them on a daily basis, which in turn lifts engagement. Guessing games like Higher or Lower and interactive stories like The Magic Door have also done well, the company notes.\n\u201cSkills that make customers\u2019 lives easier, either by helping them keep track of things or do something easily, can become a daily habit that customers want to use regularly,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. There\u2019s no word yet on if there\u2019s an Alexa skill for making brunch on a Sunday morning, but I definitely have my hopes up.\n\n\n\n"}
