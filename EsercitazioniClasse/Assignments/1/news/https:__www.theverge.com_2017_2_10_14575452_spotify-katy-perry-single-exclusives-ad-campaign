{"title": "Instead of buying exclusives, Spotify lures artists with promises of bigger audiences", "content": " \nSpotify has started to lean on its biggest strength to appeal to big-name artists: its listeners. According to a report from Bloomberg, the company is running a \u201cmonths long promotional campaign\u201d leading up to the release of Katy Perry\u2019s new album \u2014 and they\u2019re doing it for free. The idea is that by putting its many resources into promoting a single album, Spotify can prove its influence in the industry if the album does well.\nAs Bloomberg points out, Spotify\u2019s recently launched creator services division is behind the Katy Perry campaign. The promotional push includes ads on Spotify\u2019s interface, emails to subscribers, links to concert tickets within Spotify, and billboards in Los Angeles and London. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for a billboard,\u201d Martin Kirkup, a partner at the marketing firm that represents Perry told Bloomberg. \u201c[Spotify] offered it.\u201d\nThe campaign is one of several Spotify has recently launched (Shawn Mendes and The Weeknd also reportedly received some promo help) to show how the company can capitalize on its huge userbase in a way that\u2019s appealing to artists. Spotify has far more users than any other streaming service. Last June, the company announced it had over 100 million subscribers and around 40 million of those are paid subscribers. In September, Apple Music had around 17 million subscribers, while Tidal was still hovering around 3 million. \nHaving millions more users helps\nBut despite its massive size, Spotify doesn\u2019t have something both Tidal and Apple Music do: exclusives. Chance the Rapper\u2019s Coloring Book was initially an Apple Music exclusive, and it became the first streaming-only album to make it onto the Billboard 200 charts. And Drake, whose track \u201cOne Dance\u201d has been the most-streamed song on Spotify for months, notably released that song\u2019s full album as an Apple Music exclusive. \nAside from exclusives, Spotify has also been sidelined by major artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift (Beyonc\u00e9 released her album Lemonade as a Tidal exclusive, while Swift removed all of her albums from Spotify in 2014 over the royalties Spotify gives rights holders).\nSpotify has gradually begun to respond to these threats to its model. Last August, Troy Carter, Spotify\u2019s global head of creator services, said that exclusives were \"bad for artists, bad for consumers, and bad for the whole industry.\" As for the issue of royalties, Carter told Bloomberg he doesn\u2019t really think that matters anymore. \u201cThe argument over ad-supported vs. premium, and whether Spotify pays or not, I think it\u2019s gone,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Spotify doesn't want to fight for exclusives or offer the best royalties, then raw data may be its best bet. Spotify's reach is impressive. It's millions of users don't just listen to the service, but see the ads and promotional playlists scattered across it. If you use Spotify today, almost all of the ads you\u2019ll see will be for Katy Perry\u2019s new single, \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d \u2014 even if you\u2019ve never listened to a Katy Perry song in your life.\nSpotify\u2019s plan seems to be working. This was recently demonstrated by Ed Sheeran\u2019s release of two new singles simultaneously last month. Both \u201cShape of You\u201d and \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d broke Spotify\u2019s previous record for streams within a 24-hour period with more than 6 million streams each. (The previous record-holder was One Direction\u2019s \u201cDrag Me Down,\u201d with around 4.7 million streams). \u201cShape\u201d also broke Spotify\u2019s record for first-week plays. Both those songs debuted in the Top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 \u2014 with \u201cShape\u201d becoming Sheeran\u2019s first-ever No. 1 debut, and \u201cCastle\u201d in the No. 6 slot. This wasn\u2019t all Spotify\u2019s doing (Apple Music doesn\u2019t make its streaming numbers public), but Sheeran\u2019s mutually beneficial relationship with Spotify certainly helped. \nListen to Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry\nAs Musically points out, when Sheeran announced his new singles on Twitter, he linked to a widget that listed both tracks on Spotify before Apple Music and iTunes. Acknowledging that the lineup in this widget is probably not a coincidence, it seems like Sheeran and his label wanted to push listeners toward Spotify. \nSo Sheeran pushes listeners to Spotify, and Spotify pushes listeners to Ed Sheeran. \u201cShape of You\u201d is currently sitting atop Spotify\u2019s Global Top 50 playlist and its United States Top 50 playlist. Right now, on Spotify\u2019s Today\u2019s Top Hits playlist, \u201cShape of You\u201d is in the No. 2 position. In the No. 1 slot? Katy Perry\u2019s newest single.\n\n\n"}
