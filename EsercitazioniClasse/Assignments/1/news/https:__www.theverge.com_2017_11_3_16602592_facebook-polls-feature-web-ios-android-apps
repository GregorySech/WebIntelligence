{"title": "Facebook rolls out GIF-supported polls feature to web and mobile apps", "content": " \nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to ask your Facebook friends really important questions, like \u201cshould I have chicken nuggets, or actually cook adult food for dinner?\u201d now you can in poll form. Today, Facebook has rolled out a GIF-supported poll feature that allows users to post votable questions as a new status on both the web and iOS and Android apps. You will also be able to add GIFs and photos as responses, too, instead of just plain old boring text.\nTo create one, just hit compose post, or click on the \u201cwhat\u2019s on your mind\u201d section. Below the text box will be a button that says \u201cPoll,\u201d as well as other options. Then you can type in your question in the text box with two options for answers. There\u2019s no limit to how long your question can be, but your responses are limited to 25 characters.\nTo add a photo or GIF, as your answer, hit on the camera or GIF icon in the option line for responses. You can add a duration for how long you want your poll to be open, with options for one day, one week, custom, or never. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move follows Instagram which added polling stickers to its Stories feature just last month. Twitter also has a polling feature, but allows for up to four response options, instead of Facebook\u2019s two. \nFacebook has experimented with polls in the past: the feature perviously existed as far back as 2007 for advertisers and marketers, and was available in Groups and Events for polling members / attendees. Like the latter version of the poll feature, today\u2019s GIF-supported polls are not anonymous; your answers will be recorded and displayed for the poster to see, just like on Instagram.\n"}
