{"title": "Marvel just joined Comixology\u2019s Unlimited subscription service", "content": " \nMarvel comics fans will now be able to dive into old and new titles starring their favorite characters on Comixology for just a few bucks per month. io9 reports that Marvel has hopped aboard the Comixology Unlimited subscription service, giving subscribers access to many of the company\u2019s best comic book arcs.\nComixology Unlimited, the digital comics company\u2019s Netflix-style subscription service, launched last year, giving readers access to work from a variety of indie imprints like Dark Horse, Image, and Boom Studios. However, the Big Two imprints, Marvel and DC, were conspicuously absent from the initial rollout. Now, a year later, Marvel is offering readers the ability to \u201cborrow\u201d books like the first arc of Darth Vader and the first issue of America. Here\u2019s the sampling of the titles now available through Unlimited:\n\nAll-New Wolverine (2015-) #1-#10\nAmazing Spider-Man Vol. 1.1: Learning To Crawl\nAmazing Spider-Man Vol. 3: Spider-Verse\nAmerica (2017-) #1\nBlack Panther: Who Is The Black Panther?\nBlack Widow (2014-2015) #1-#12\nCable & Deadpool Vol. 1: If Looks Could Kill\nCivil War\nElektra (2017-) #1\nFantastic Four Special 2005 #1\nGamora (2016-) #1-#3\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1: Cosmic Avengers\nGuardians of the Galaxy: New Guard Vol. 1: Emperor Quill\nInvincible Iron Man (2008-2012) #1-#12\nIron Fist (2017-) #1\nMs. Marvel Vol. 1: No Normal\nRocket Raccoon (2016-) #1-#2\nRunaways Vol. 1: Pride and Joy\nShe-Hulk Vol. 3: Time Trials\nSpider-Gwen Vol. 1: Greater Power\nStar Wars Vol. 1: Skywalker Strikes\nStar Wars: Darth Maul (2017-) #1\nStar Wars: Darth Vader Vol. 1: Vader\nX-23 (2010-2012) #1-#16\nX-Men Prime (2017) #1\n\nAnd, since Comixology is an Amazon company, Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime Reading are also getting Marvel collections as part of the partnership:\n\nAstonishing X-Men Vol. 1: Gifted\nSpider-Man Vol. 1: Brand New Day\nNew Avengers Vol. 1: Breakout\nDeadpool Vol. 1: Secret Invasion\nStar Wars Vol. 1: Skywalker Strikes\nThor by J. Michael Straczynski Vol. 1\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier Vol. 1\nHawkeye Vol. 1: My Life As A Weapon\nPatsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!

That service costs $9.99 a month, and lets fans read Marvel\u2019s entire digital library of over 17,000 titles up until six months prior to the current week. That\u2019s probably the better option if you\u2019re a Marvel devotee, but if you\u2019re content to have a taste of some of the House of Ideas\u2019 biggest and best stories while also having the option to dive into critically acclaimed series like Image\u2019s Saga for free, Comixology Unlimited is a pretty sweet deal.\nCorrection 12:05pm ET: A previous version of this article stated that the above Marvel titles were a complete list of what is now available on Comixology Unlimited. That was incorrect; it was only a selection. The article has since been updated, and we regret the error.\n"}
