{"title": "Google\u2019s Pixel 2 phones are the first to use built-in eSIM technology", "content": " \nYou\u2019ll be able to use Google\u2019s newest smartphones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, without needing to pop in a SIM card, the company announced today. As long as you\u2019re a Project Fi subscriber, Google will use the devices\u2019 built-in eSIMs to authenticate your cellular account. Prior to today, no smartphone has ever used the eSIM standard. The relatively new technology has typically been reserved for LTE-equipped tablets, smartwatches, and other cellular wearables. \n\u201cThis means you no longer need to go to a store to get a SIM card for wireless service, wait a few days for your card to arrive in the mail, or fumble around with a bent paper clip to coax your SIM card into a tiny slot,\u201d writes Joy Xi, a product manager for Project Fi, in Google\u2019s official blog post on the subject. \u201cGetting wireless service with eSIM is as quick as connecting your phone to Wi-Fi.\u201d  \nXi says users should see the option to use eSIM to connect to the Fi network on all Pixel 2 devices purchased through either the Google Store or through Fi itself. If you\u2019re already a subscriber, Xi says you\u2019ll simply turn on your new Pixel 2 device, tap the SIM-free option during setup, and Google will \u201ctake care of the heavy lifting.\u201d \nSwitching SIM cards can be quite obnoxious, especially if you happen to be moving between devices regularly, either out of habit or for work, and happen to need SIM adapters to make it all work. So it\u2019s nice to see Google embracing eSIM tech on its own network, a process it says it\u2019s piloting with Pixel and Fi for now. Down the line, \u201cWe look forward to sharing what we learn and working together with industry partners to encourage more widespread adoption,\u201d Xi writes. A SIM-less future would be nice indeed. \n"}
