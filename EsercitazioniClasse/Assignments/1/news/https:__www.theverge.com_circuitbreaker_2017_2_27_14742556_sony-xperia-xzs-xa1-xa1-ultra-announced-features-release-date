{"title": "Sony's 'super mid-range' XA1 and Xperia XZs flesh out its 2017 phone range", "content": " \nSony\u2019s just-announced XZ Premium isn\u2019t the company\u2019s only new smartphone debuting here at Mobile World Congress. Along with the Premium, billed as Sony\u2019s \u201cmost ground-breaking smartphone to date,\u201d three other phones are also being unveiled today. The first and most interesting is the Xperia XZs, which features the exact same, new 19-megapixel Motion Eye camera system that\u2019s found in the XZ Premium. It can do the 960-frames-per-second slowmo. It\u2019s got the same Predictive Capture feature that\u2019s meant to prevent you from missing fleeting moments. And since it captures larger pixels, Sony says low light performance has improved as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXperia XZs\nSony\n\n\nSo the XZs has the same camera as XZ Premium \u2014 though we can\u2019t assess Sony\u2019s grand talk until we possess both phones. What the XZs doesn\u2019t have is the flashy 4K HDR display. Instead, it\u2019s got a 5.2-inch 1080p screen (also with 2.5D curved glass running over the top. Instead of glass on both sides, the XZs has a metal back, which a fair number of people might prefer once seeing all the fingerprints and smudges that instantly dominate the XZ Premium. \nSony\u2019s outfitted the XZs with a Snapdragon 820, a few generations removed from the still-new 835 processor it managed to procure for the Premium. But the XZs carries on other Sony signatures like water resistance. The XZs will launch beginning in April, with pricing info coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXperia XA1 Ultra\nSony\n\n\nRounding out the company\u2019s early 2017 phone lineup are the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Sigh. Sony\u2019s really got to rethink this naming strategy. Both are powered by Mediatek Helio P20 processors and feature edge-to-edge displays (albeit with sizable top and bottom bezels). The XA1 has a 5-inch 720p screen, so it\u2019s not going to be a pixels-per-inch champion. The XA1 has a 1080p display, but it\u2019s a much larger 6-inch panel. Both devices have a 23-megapixel f/2 rear camera lens, though they differ when it comes to the selfie cam. The XA1 has an 8-megapixel front camera, while the XA1 increases that to 16-megapixels and adds optical image stabilization for the vloggers in this world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXperia XA1\nSony\n\n\nBoth phones include \u201cXperia Actions,\u201d a new software feature that Sony claims can learn user habits and automatically change settings and manage apps according. An example from the company\u2019s press release says: \u201cwhen you go to bed your Xperia can learn your bedtime routine and automatically adjust the screen brightness and call volume.\u201d The XA1 and XA1 Ultra will be released starting this spring in white, black, pink, and gold. Pricing info will follow soon. \n"}
