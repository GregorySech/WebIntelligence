{"content": " Welcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review originally appeared in conjunction with 1922\u2019s premiere at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. It is being reposted to coincide with the film\u2019s Netflix release.2017 has been a banner year for Stephen King adaptations, but the batting average hasn\u2019t been so hot. It is easily the best of the bunch: in spite of its \u201cmore, and then much more\u201d aesthetic, it hit big with audiences, and is now reportedly the highest-grossing horror film of all time. And Netflix\u2019s Gerald\u2019s Game does a startlingly impressive job of drawing out the novel with memorable performances. The Dark Tower, on the other hand, was a confused, generic would-be series-launcher, and Spike TV\u2019s The Mist and the Audience Network\u2019s Mr. Mercedes series have both been accused of stretching out their stories until their energies get lost along the way.That criticism highlights the problem with virtually all of 2017\u2019s King adaptations: they aren\u2019t out to tell simple, direct stories. It is the first half of a two-film package, Dark Tower was planned as one installment in a sprawling film-and-TV cinematic universe, and Mr. Mercedes is in a position to continue its stories if the ratings justify the expense.  So was The Mist, but Spike TV eventually cancelled it.  Which is why 2017\u2019s latest King adaptation, Netflix\u2019s feature film 1922, comes as such a comparative relief. It isn\u2019t trying to lay the foundations for a grand, cosmic universe. It isn\u2019t trying to build characters who can sell their own merch and carry their own spin-offs down the road. It\u2019s just a simple, single self-contained horror story.It\u2019s also a phenomenally grim one, as King readers can already attest.What\u2019s the genre?Gothic heartland horror. The exact nature of that horror is ambiguous, and left up to the viewer more than it is in King\u2019s novella, but regardless, it\u2019s a gory tragedy in the most classical sense.What\u2019s it about?Thomas Jane was hilariously awful in the King adaptation Dreamcatcher, but he acquits himself memorably here. He stars as Wilfred James, a farmer grimly clinging to his family land in 1920s Nebraska. His wife Arlette  Molly Parker of Deadwood and House of Cards fame  has recently inherited a significant plot of farmland, which she wants to sell so the family can move to Omaha, \u201cor even St. Louis!\u201d Wilf, however, is disgusted by the idea of city living. He has his entire life planned out: work the farm, hang on to what he has, live without what he doesn\u2019t have  indoor plumbing, for instance , and pass his farm on to their 14-year-old son Henry  Dylan Schmid  when he dies. Arlette\u2019s plan to sell her acreage to a hog-farming combine would pollute his land, and giving in to her plan would mean either living in the city, or divorcing her and inevitably losing Henry to her custody. So Wilf quietly plans to murder Arlette, and to bring Henry in on the act to assure the boy\u2019s silence and lock him to the land. What\u2019s it really about?Consequences and guilt. 1922 is essentially a Midwestern riff on Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Tell-Tale Heart, with its own considerable twists: Wilf doesn\u2019t hack up his wife or bury her under the floorboards, and he isn\u2019t caught because he loses his mind in front of friendly cops. But the movie opens with him sitting down in a hotel room to write his confession, and as the film progresses, it becomes clear that as locked in one place as he is, he\u2019s never managed to outrun his shame. This is a story about conscience and sin, and the way murder tarnishes the soul. This is a fairly heady idea for a film made in a country where our films, TV shows, and video games all routinely feature heroes killing anyone marked as a \u201cbad guy.\u201d 1922 screenwriter and director Zak Hilditch doesn\u2019t entirely draw out the theme, not as much as King did, but he certainly lets the audience know exactly how Wilf\u2019s crimes poison his life and his planned future.NetflixIs it good?It has its problems, though they mostly stem from King\u2019s source material. Hilditch sticks closely to King\u2019s narrative, apart from a surprising change in the literal last second of the story. But that means he inherits King\u2019s plot structure, which among other things has a considerable amount of the story only being revealed through a sort of magical vision, and only after the fact.On the other hand, Hilditch doesn\u2019t take as much time as King did in laying out the characters. Like The Tell-Tale Heart, the film version of 1922 races toward the mechanics of the murder without spending enough time on establishing who the protagonist is, and whether murder is naturally in his makeup, or he has to struggle his way toward it. Like virtually all the King adapters who respect his strikingly individual storylines instead of radically rewriting them into something more generic and obvious, Hilditch keeps some of King\u2019s actual language, turning it into a voiceover where Wilf explains his inner thoughts. But that alone doesn\u2019t go far enough toward explaining who Wilf is, or why his story should matter to viewers. He\u2019s a much more quickly sketched character here than he is in King\u2019s story, and that hurts the momentum. But Jane\u2019s lean, hungry, squinting portrayal goes a long way toward filling in the blanks. In a post-screening Q&A at Fantastic Fest, Jane said he worked with a vocal coach to get down the strange drawling accent he uses in the film \u2014 a Nebraska accent derived from period recordings, before mass media and worldwide communication started easing the variety and color out of regional speech patterns. It\u2019s a highly specific choice, much like the way Jane occasionally punctuates his words with derisive spitting, or the lizardy, narrow-eyed way he watches and judges the world around him. He\u2019s a powerful central figure, and his role here covers a range he hasn\u2019t always achieved well, from anger to affection to determination to stark terror.Schmid and Parker also do impressive work, with Parker in particular making conscious choices to sand some of the most uncomfortable edges off Arlette, making her strong rather than shrill. And Hilditch does sometimes let the story stretch out into the laconic fireside story it needs to be; he focuses on sunsets and cornfields, on the farm that\u2019s Wilf\u2019s entire world. He brings down the weight of time passing in a way that\u2019s crucial to the story. And when the shocks start, they\u2019re both well-timed and memorably staged. He has an eye for horrifying imagery. King\u2019s novella centers in part on an image Wilf can\u2019t get out of his head, and when Hilditch puts it on the screen, it\u2019s easy to see why Wilf can\u2019t shake it. 1922 gets rushed in both the first and the third act, and it achieves its best moments in the middle going, with character work between Jane and Schmid. But at its best, it\u2019s a reminder that King\u2019s biggest strengths lie in his unparalleled ability to build tension, create atmosphere, and tell a direct and brutal story, not in his ability to launch profitable many-branched franchises.What should it be rated?It\u2019s bloody and disturbing, but also reasonably circumspect about most of the violence. PG-13 seems reasonable. How can I actually watch it?1922 debuted on Netflix on October 20, 2017.", "title": "Netflix\u2019s 1922 is a reminder of what Stephen King does best"}
