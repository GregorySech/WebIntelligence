{"title": "The Republican tax plan could financially devastate graduate students", "content": " \nKathleen Farley, a graduate student in biological sciences, paid $2,824 in taxes on her stipend of $25,969 last year. If President Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan takes effect, she calculates that she\u2019ll have to pay $5,174 \u2014 almost double what she\u2019s paying now. The unexpected financial burden might force her to drop out of Rutgers University-Newark. \u201cIf you walk away, you have nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI would have just lost four years.\u201d\n\u201cIf you walk away, you have nothing.\u201d\nFarley is one of the thousands of graduate students who would be hit especially hard by Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If it were to pass unchanged, roughly 145,000 graduate students could be responsible for suddenly paying taxes on the thousands of dollars in waivers that cover their tuition, but that never appear in their bank accounts. A House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman told The Verge in an email that \"the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is focused on providing tax relief,\" but then confirmed in a subsequent response that the bill would do the exact opposite for graduate students by taxing their tuition reductions: \"This compensation would no longer be excluded from taxable income.\u201d\nAcademic research relies on PhD students. They\u2019re more like apprentices who teach and conduct research than like students in school. Many are paid a small stipend to live on, and their tuition is also typically waived by their university or paid by their faculty advisor\u2019s grants. Right now, those tuition waivers aren\u2019t taxed. But one terse line in the proposed tax bill could change that by taxing these waivers as additional income. \u201cThis is a fake number that is suddenly becoming real, and that\u2019s why people are panicking,\u201d says political scientist Robert Paul Musgrave at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \n\u201cThis is a fake number that is suddenly becoming real.\u201d\nSome, like Farley and fellow Rutgers student Nicole Dykstra, suspect they\u2019ll have to drop out if the bill passes. \u201cThe new proposal will be a sudden, unforecasted expense for us,\u201d says Dykstra, an Army Reservist who served in Iraq with the National Guard. Dykstra currently splits her time between Connecticut, where her husband works and lives with their six-year-old son, and New Jersey, where she\u2019s spent more than two years working towards her PhD. \u201cIf I were to leave right now, I would leave empty handed.\u201d \nThe unexpected increase in taxes could change the rules mid-game for current graduate students, more than half of whom made less than $20,000 during the 2011-2012 academic year, according to the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources. Students who started PhD programs understanding that they may not make much money for the next four to eight years could now have to face going into unanticipated debt. \nFor Taryn Black, a PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle, the new proposal more than doubles the taxes on her stipend of $29,592, from roughly $1800 to $4,230 per year. It might be enough to drive Black, a geoscientist, into the private sector. \u201cI love what I do but I\u2019m not going to go into debt for a job,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be forced out of it because our government thinks that I should pay taxes on my ability to even have this education, it\u2019s really frustrating and it would be really disappointing.\u201d \n\u201cIt essentially dismantles the entire system.\u201d\nGraduate students are the cheap engine of academic research. By driving prospective students away, \u201cit essentially dismantles the entire system,\u201d says Claus Wilke, a computational biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. When students ask him if they should accept a graduate school\u2019s offer, he tells them there\u2019s a simple rule of thumb: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to pay tuition, and your living costs should be covered. If that cannot be guaranteed, then the PhD program isn\u2019t really worth it,\u201d Wilke says. \u201cIf this tax law went through then essentially every PhD program in the US would not meet this bar anymore.\u201d\nThe damage could reach farther than this generation of PhD students: \u201cWhen you attack higher ed, you also attack the ability to have a functioning country \u2014 your teachers are coming out of higher education, your policy makers, your doctors, the people who are designing your infrastructure and your airplanes,\u201d Farley says. \nGraduate education in the United States isn\u2019t perfect, of course; students are training for a dwindling supply of academic jobs and many consider themselves under-compensated for valuable work they perform. Roughly 12 percent of PhDs already graduate with more than $70,000 in debt from student loans for college and graduate school, The Atlantic reports. \u201cReform is necessary,\u201d says Farley, who\u2019s active in the Rutgers graduate student union. \u201cBut a system that breaks and breaks everyone with it isn\u2019t the ideal way to reform.\u201d\n\u201cA system that breaks and breaks everyone with it isn\u2019t the ideal way to reform.\u201d\nMusgrave doesn\u2019t think that the tax increase will ultimately fall to graduate students, but to universities. \u201cUniversities will be weakened in one way or another as they seek to get out from under this mandate,\u201d he says. One possible workaround could be for universities to cut the tuition bill by reducing the number of units graduate students are required to enroll in. Another could be to raise student stipends to cover the tax hike, which would make graduate students more expensive to employ. That could hit public universities especially hard, since they might be less financially and legally able to maneuver by reducing tuition costs, Musgrave says. \u201cIf the best people aren\u2019t going to come to your university because they\u2019ll be bankrupted by doing so, you\u2019ll lose not only your graduate students but also your faculty,\u201d he says. \nIt\u2019s also possible that the tax bill could still change. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a draft at this point,\u201d says Robert Kelchen, an expert in higher education finance at Seton Hall University. The senate will draft its own bill, and both bills will have to make their ways through committees. But Kelchen suspects that the higher education provisions will stay in the House\u2019s bill through the revision process. \u201cIf they take away some of these cuts to education, that messes up the math for the rest of the tax bill,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd frankly the higher education lobby isn\u2019t as strong as some of the other lobbying groups.\u201d \nMany of the students view the tax bill as an attack on higher education. But Patrick Thomas, director of the tax clinic at the University of Notre Dame, suspects that something less malicious, but equally insidious may be behind it: a screw up. \u201cI almost get the sense that this provision with respect to graduate students was unintentional or an oversight,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine enacting such a large policy change, that affects so many individuals and so many institutes of higher education without somehow talking about it,\u201d he says. But, he adds, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s me being hopeful.\u201d\nUpdate November 7th, 4:30PM ET:  Updated to include a quote from a House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman.\n\n \n\n"}
