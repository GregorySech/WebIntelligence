{"title": "Stephen King\u2019s It is the rare monster movie with too much monster", "content": " \nIn the broad plot details, Andr\u00e9s Muschietti\u2019s 2017 Stephen King adaptation It is astonishingly close to Rob Reiner\u2019s 1986 Stephen King adaptation Stand By Me. In both movies, a group of pre-adolescent kids run around the outskirts of a small town, bonding during the long summer days and nights. In both movies, one of those kids has a terrifying abusive father; another has recently lost a brother, and his shell-shocked parents have mostly abandoned him to his own devices. \nThe child protagonists in both Stand By Me and It are outcasts and nerds, largely ignored and forced to find comfort in each other. They\u2019re all hunted by a pack of ferocious, dangerous bullies \u2014 bigger kids who are bored with their sleepy town, and victimize other people for entertainment. Both groups of kids set out to look for a corpse, and along the way, they become each other\u2019s emotional support, with all the idealized intensity and simplicity Stephen King always puts into evoking childhood. And both films are openly coming-of-age stories, about the last days of innocence before unwanted adult realizations and responsibilities set in.\nBut only one of these movies has the kids facing a shape-shifting killer clown.\n\nIn Stand By Me, the only real monster is death itself \u2014 the sudden understanding, brought on by a child\u2019s corpse, that childhood doesn\u2019t last forever, and even kids can die. In It, the child corpses pile up early and often, and an understanding of death is baked into the world \u2014 especially into the town of Derry, Maine. The film\u2019s first death occurs in its opening sequence, as a horrifying clown calling himself Pennywise (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) lures a little boy named Georgie Denbrough into a fatal trap. Months later, Georgie\u2019s brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, from St. Vincent and Midnight Special) has become obsessed with finding Georgie\u2019s body, and he leads his friends Ritchie (Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), and Stan (Wyatt Oleff) into trouble as they search the sewers for some sign of the boy.\nOther children have gone missing as well. When the group, eventually dubbing themselves The Losers\u2019 Club, hooks up with town new kid and amateur historian Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), he informs them that Derry\u2019s murder rate is six times the national average, and kids disappear at an even higher rate. One by one, their group \u2014 plus token girl Beverly (Sophia Lillis) and token black kid Mike (Chosen Jacobs) \u2014 encounters Pennywise in different monstrous forms tailored to their personal fears. Soon, they understand that Derry\u2019s adults won\u2019t do anything about It, and it\u2019s up to them to fight back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Warner Bros.\n\n\nThe \u201cencountering Pennywise one by one\u201d dynamic gives It its biggest problems. Director Andr\u00e9s Muschietti and his writers (Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman) stick close to King\u2019s massive 1,200-page novel, porting in his dialogue where they can, and adding in-jokes and Easter eggs to acknowledge where they skim over King\u2019s bigger, harder-to-convey elements. They ditch the vision-quest encounters with the cosmic turtle who created the world, but as a wink-wink move for audience members in the know, they throw in visual and verbal turtle references. They also drop the ridiculous child-orgy, while acknowledging the themes of rite-of-passage and sealed personal intimacy behind it.\nBut inevitably, slimming the story down to a 135-minute run time involves cutting a lot of individual character time, to the point where several of the Losers blend together. Some abrupt, confusing edits suggest a longer version of the story where the more neglected protagonists get more screen time, but as it is, Stan\u2019s entire characterization is \u201cJewish kid with bar mitzvah approaching,\u201d and Mike\u2019s is \u201cblack kid who lives on a farm.\u201d\nAnd not knowing all of these characters well means not understanding what scares them, and why it should scare the audience, too. Beverly is one of the better-developed Losers, and her fear of puberty and menstruation \u2014 driven by her abusive father, who sees her physical development as a threat to his control \u2014 gives It one of its eeriest moments. Her bloody encounter with Pennywise closely recalls images in two other famous King screen adaptations, Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining and Brian De Palma\u2019s Carrie. It\u2019s a primal sequence, scary on its face, but also resonant with personal meaning for Beverly. It shows how It is meant to function, as a window into individual psyches, and into a monster that explores and exploits them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Warner Bros.\n\n\nBy contrast, many of the other It encounters blur by in a repetitive wave of on-screen lunges and screams, provoked by CGI threats and the same imagery over and over. King\u2019s It is a wandering, discursive book that spends plenty of time on the mechanics of what terrifies individual people, and the varied ways they respond to that terror. The idea of a shape-shifting monster that taps into its victims\u2019 fears is unbeatably personal and flexible. Both King and Muschietti use it to great effect, haunting the characters with jittery walking corpses and a twisted Modigliani-style painting come to life. But there are seven kids in the Losers\u2019 Club, and all seven of them have to have jump-scare-filled personal encounters with Pennywise. Then they start hunting It, and It isolates them and victimizes them separately again, with diminishing returns for both It and the audience. After a while, there\u2019s just too much monster charging mindlessly at the screen, and not enough time to process the characters\u2019 reactions, or to distinguish one curiously failed attack from the next.\nBut It has two major saving graces: Muschietti\u2019s eye for striking images is one of the film\u2019s core assets, and his ghost story Mama often comes to mind throughout It. Unlike most monster movies, which withhold their central critters until the end to build up suspense and mystery, Muschietti put Mama\u2019s monster on-screen early, and trained viewers to fear her for her unsettling eeriness and malice. He does the same with Pennywise, leaving any sense of mystery and dread out of the film, but replacing it with sharp shocks and Uncanny Valley creepiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Warner Bros.\n\n\nAnd the convincing child cast carries the film when the scares start to feel redundant. Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sophia Lillis are particular standouts \u2014 as the smart, fat kid with a crush, he\u2019s surprisingly tender and nuanced, and as the tough girl with an unpleasant secret, she\u2019s close to heartbreaking. But all seven of the central children are well-cast and give strong performances, and seen through their eyes, Pennywise seems like a real threat \u2014 a childhood nightmare improbably manifested in the real world \u2014 instead of like the faintly goofy, try-hard boogeyman he could so easily be. \nStill, it\u2019s easy to wish for a more Stand By Me-like approach to It. Rob Reiner\u2019s King adaptation is far from perfect, but without a monster haunting the kids, it has much more leisure time to explore their personalities and problems, to dig into their individual relationships and show how not all friendships are created equal. Both films take up King\u2019s obsession with nostalgia and the past, with the connections between youthful trauma and adult behavior, and with the abrupt, startling exact moment when childhood ends. It does all these things bigger, louder, and spookier, with the equivalent of a sustained shriek at the audience. But even the loudest shriek stops being scary after two hours. Muschietti is already planning a sequel \u2014 the second half of King\u2019s book, heavily foreshadowed in this film, where the scattered Losers return to Derry to face Pennywise as adults. With any luck, that half of the story will take a little more time to breathe in the fears it evokes, and take the time to appreciate their impact as much as their imagery.\n"}
