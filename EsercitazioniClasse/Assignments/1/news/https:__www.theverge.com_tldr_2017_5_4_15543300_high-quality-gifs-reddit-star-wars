{"title": "GIF-making subreddit donates its landing page to Star Wars Day prank", "content": " \nr/HighQualityGifs is a subreddit honoring really good GIFs, and in particular the days when GIFs were made, as a mod writes \u201cone frame at a time in MS Paint.\u201d It has, unfortunately, been forced to realize its irrelevance in the age of Giphy. But it has also been forced to celebrate Star Wars, because today is May 4th.\nSo, the whole subreddit has been redesigned into a Star Wars opening credits scroll, with text flying over the real (clickable) front page of Reddit. It moves too fast to read the whole thing on your first try, so you\u2019ll have to refresh a few times to get the whole message. But the gist of it is: everyone knows how to make GIFs with one of dozens of easy-to-use programs, and it\u2019s cool but it sucks. \n\u201cyou probably don\u2019t remember dancing baby.\u201d\nMost of the message is a tirade against Reddit newcomers, the type of user who can be dissed for having \u201cdefault sub friends\u201d (people who subscribe only to the default subreddits that Reddit subscribes every new account to), not remembering \u201cwhen 500KB was a large file size,\u201d and being a \u201cDaily Show watching son of a bitch.\u201d \n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember dancing baby, coming soon GIFs, dancing banana, or Netscape\u2019s loading GIF either... You got no reputation here, you got no name,\u201d the litany continues. But it ends on a nice note: please hang out anyway. \u201cI hope you stay here and learn our ways.\u201d\nIn honor of the high-quality GIFs of yesteryear, here\u2019s a low-quality GIF of r/HighQualityGifs. In honor of Star Wars, here\u2019s Star Wars kind of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresumably the subreddit will go back to normal tomorrow, unless it\u2019s planning to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.\n"}
