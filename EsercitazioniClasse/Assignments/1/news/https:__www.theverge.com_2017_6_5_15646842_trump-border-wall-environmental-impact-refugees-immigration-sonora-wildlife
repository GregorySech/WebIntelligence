{"title": "Trump\u2019s border wall threatens people and wildlife in the Sonoran Desert \u2014 and no law can stop it", "content": " \nWhen Brendan Lenihan was in the Border Patrol between 2006 and 2011, he spent a lot of time in a mountainous basin and range landscape that envelops borderland communities in southern Arizona. On both sides of the border, twisted mounds of creosote and tall saguaro cactus dominate the flat, dusty expanses that stretch between the jagged lines of mountains that jut up dramatically against the sky. It\u2019s dry, hot, and drab, and seemingly everything is covered in thorns. But the desert is always good for a surprise, like the bright green slashes of willow and cottonwood-lined creeks that cut across the landscape, or the amber pockets of grassland meadows that yield firework displays of orange and yellow wildflower blooms in the spring.  \n\u201cI just stepped over the wires laying on the ground, and I was in Mexico.\u201d\nOnce, while Lenihan was out on a patrol near Sasabe, Arizona, a tiny town next to the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, \u201cI walked across a four- or five-strand cattle fence that I thought was just from some ranch in the US,\u201d he said. The fence was knocked down, as Lenihan recalled, \u201cso I just kind of stepped over the wires laying on the ground, and I was in Mexico.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize it until his faulty GPS device rebooted, and he stepped back over the line.\nUnlike in South Texas, where the international border follows the Rio Grande River, there\u2019s no natural feature along Arizona\u2019s 370-mile southern edge to define where the US ends and Mexico begins. Pedestrian and vehicle fencing built during the border-construction boom of the mid-2000s cuts through the scrub along some stretches. Currently, about 700 miles of the 2,000-mile-long border is marked with some kind of barrier.\nThat may change. With the executive order signed on January 25th, President Donald Trump took the first steps toward making good on his oft-repeated campaign promise to build a wall across the entire 2,000-mile-long border. The Department of Homeland Security will first focus on about 100 miles of \u201chigh priority\u201d stretches of the border that are near cities, including areas south of Tucson. \nLenihan\u2019s accidental crossing into Mexico is understandable: The land on either side of the border is the Sonoran Desert. A biodiversity hot spot, the desert is indifferent to human divisions. So Trump\u2019s proposed wall will cut across numerous mountain ranges, arroyos, rivers, and communities, including the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which abuts 62 miles of US-Mexico border, and includes about 2,000 tribal members who live in Mexico. \nTrump\u2019s proposed wall will cut across numerous mountain ranges, arroyos, rivers, and communities\nAll told, public and tribal lands comprise nearly 80 percent of the state\u2019s border, and there are 4.3 million acres of designated wilderness in this part of the state. The area is home to a host of endangered species, from the handful of American jaguars living at the far northern end of the big cat\u2019s range, to the diminutive cactus ferruginous pygmy owl. But even public land and animals protected by the federal government are not shielded from the wall.\nIn April, the Center for Biological Diversity and Arizona Congressman Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, a Democrat, sued the Trump administration over the executive order. The suit argues that DHS hasn\u2019t conducted the requisite environmental analysis for its enforcement activities required under the National Environmental Policy Act. But unlike other federal lawsuits brought against the administration over the president\u2019s executive orders, like the travel ban, the CBD case is likely to fail. \nThanks to a 2005 law, the DHS has the authority to waive any and all laws, except for the Constitution, in the name of border barrier construction. The Trump administration can disturb human remains, desecrate sacred sites, destroy wildlife habitat, foul air and water, and bring new development to the second largest tract of wilderness in the lower 48 \u2014 and all with near complete impunity.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he joined the Border Patrol, Lenihan started his professional life in what is essentially the family business: the National Park Service. His archaeologist father, Daniel Lenihan, started NPS\u2019s Submerged Resources Center, leading teams of scuba divers who map shipwrecks in national parks around the country; his mother also worked for NPS in Santa Fe before she had her two sons. \nLenihan grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but the family spent time bouncing around from park to park, staying in rangers\u2019 houses or cabins around the country, playing with the kids of other Parks Service families. Later, both brothers spent time on their dad\u2019s team, and Lenihan dove to the sunken hull of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor, and the wreckage of one of the ferries that carried immigrants to and from Ellis Island. During the spring and summer of 2006, he served as a law enforcement ranger at Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California, doing search and rescue operations in the backcountry and making sure no one was growing weed on public land.\n\u201cIllegal immigration fascinated me.\u201d\nLenihan saw a recruiting ad for the Border Patrol, which went on a hiring spree in the mid-2000s. Between growing up in New Mexico and a love of Cormac McCarthy novels, Lenihan knew the draw of the desert, and he thought that serving in CBP would be a great adventure. \n\u201cIllegal immigration fascinated me,\u201d Lenihan said, \u201cand I wanted to know what was really going on in the deserts of Arizona and New Mexico and Texas. I wanted to see it for myself.\u201d \nBeing out on a patrol in the mountainous desert \u2014 where you might stumble upon massive golden eagles nesting in the craggy peaks, and herds of hog-like javelina regularly come rushing out from the scrub \u2014 \u201ccan be very quiet and very desolate, and it was a very nice place to commune with nature,\u201d Lenihan said. But there\u2019s no mistaking the Sonora of southern Arizona with the desert national parks Lenihan grew up visiting. Border Patrol has carved these public lands with 12,000 miles of illegal off-road tracks. (The roads are not permitted and located in wilderness areas, where development is restricted.) Both smugglers and migrants leave more than a trace, too, with an estimated 2,000 tons of trash pulled out of the parks every year. Looking out at the rugged mountains, Lenihan said you can sometimes see bits of broken glass shimmer like tinsel in the harsh light.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a lot of appreciation for America's best idea,\u201d said Lenihan, who just finished his last semester of law school at the University of Arizona. He strongly believes in protecting public lands for future generations to enjoy. But when it comes to the border, his Parks Service and Border Patrol work has left Lenihan torn between their philosophies of conservation and enforcement.\n\u201cThe border wall is fundamentally a human rights issue.\u201d\nOnce, he was walking down a trail about 15 miles north of the border when he came across the starkest reminder of the harsh environment and the risk migrants take trying to cross it: a human skull, with the rest of the body sitting under a mesquite tree nearby. \u201cI was just enjoying myself, and I was kicking rocks, and I almost went up to kick it \u2014 I thought it was just a white stone,\u201d he said. Last year, there were 170 migrant deaths in the Arizona desert, according to Humane Borders. Many of the deceased are unidentified, and only skeletal remains were found.\n\u201cThe border wall is fundamentally a human rights issue \u2014 it restricts the free flow of people,\u201d said Tucson resident Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham tribal member. What makes the ecology of the desert so singular, with its host of plants and animals adapted to the heat and drought, can make that restriction lethal for humans. For nearly a decade, Wilson put water out for people trekking north from the border through the Baboquivari Valley \u2014 one of the deadliest areas in southern Arizona. Despite the risk, the route is frequented by migrants; there\u2019s even a Mexican bottled water brand named for it. The label shows the craggy silhouette of the nearly 8,000-foot Baboquivari peak jutting up above the surrounding range, the granite mass a beacon guiding migrants toward the north. \nThe north\u2013south valley, which runs along the reservation boundary and marks the western edge of the Tucson CBP\u2019s patrol area, has its own pockets of natural water, where creeks run under the bent boughs of sycamores and live oaks. The cool shade of places like Brown Canyon, on the east side of the mountain range, are a respite for desert wildlife, attracting big cats like mountain lions and even the occasional jaguar. Both species range widely, and are among the many animals that regularly cross back and forth across the border \u2014 behavior that Trump\u2019s wall would end. All told, border-wall construction threatens the habitat of 111 endangered species, according to a survey conducted by Outside last year. \nBorder-wall construction threatens the habitat of 111 endangered species\n\u201cWe don't even really have the science to make sure what the overall impacts are from a biological perspective,\u201d says Randy Serraglio, a southwest conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. One study found that the endangered cactus ferruginous pygmy owl \u2014 which bears a striking resemblance to The Sword in the Stone\u2019s fussy cartoon owl, Archimedes \u2014 won\u2019t fly up over the 30-foot wall. (The owl rarely flies higher than 4.5 feet.)\nThe wall also adds to the existing divisions of the landscape \u2014 which can trap animals in areas with little food or few mates. Mexico\u2019s Highway 2, which runs just south of the border, already presents a significant barrier to Sonoran pronghorn, a diminutive antelope subspecies. The pronghorn were nearly wiped out a decade ago, and were preserved through a captive breeding program. The wall, while not as deadly for them as the road, will further isolate the Arizona herd from animals south of the border.\nIf the wall proves disastrous for native species, it\u2019s worth remembering there are other ways of looking at the border. \u201cThe border should be treated as a zone to manage and steward \u2014 not seal,\u201d Lenihan wrote in a legal paper published last year in The Arizona Journal of Environmental Law and Policy. \u201cA well-managed, low-risk environment on the border is a realistic and respectable objective.\u201d Managing the border differently would make it possible to bring some of the Park Service mentality to the area: \u201cThat goal leaves room for another American value that defines this country \u2014 the stewardship and preservation of our nation\u2019s most precious natural treasures.\u201d\n CBP can\u2019t help but leave a trace out in the desert\n\u201cI think a lot of these land-management agencies understand that the border patrol isn't intentionally trying to damage the natural environment,\u201d Lenihan said, while acknowledging that CBP can\u2019t help but leave a trace out in the desert. So for him, it\u2019s about figuring ways to limit that impact \u2014 and the best way to do so, in Lenihan\u2019s opinion, is through staffing and technology, not a wall.\nEnvironmental and human rights organizations agree that a wall will only exacerbate the border\u2019s problems, but they see an increased technological footprint along the border \u2014 a \u201cvirtual fence\u201d approach built around surveillance towers, remote sensors, and other monitoring systems \u2014 as part of the larger problem of militarization. \u201cPeople are part of the environment, so human rights problems on the border and environmental problems on the border have the same source,\u201d said Dan Millis, the Sierra Club\u2019s borderlands program coordinator: militarization, wall construction, and border patrol operations that are not sensitive to human rights or the environment. \nIf jaguars and bighorn sheep and mountain lions and pronghorn likely won\u2019t cross the wall, it\u2019s clear to Lenihan who will. \u201cThe people who I have met, who I have arrested, when I see the willpower that they have to want to reunite with family members, or when I see the willpower to find a job or to escape something horrible in their home country \u2014 that kind of willpower isn't going to be\u2026\u201d Lenihan paused. \u201cA wall isn't going to stop that.\u201d\nCorrection: The original version of this story mis-identified Mike Wilson, the Tohono O\u2019odham tribal member. His first name is, indeed, Mike. We regret the error.\n"}
