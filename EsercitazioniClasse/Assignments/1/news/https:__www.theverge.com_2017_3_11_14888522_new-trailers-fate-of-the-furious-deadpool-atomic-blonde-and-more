{"title": "New trailers: Fate of the Furious, Deadpool, Atomic Blonde, and more", "content": " \nEveryone's been freaking out about Jordan Peele's Get Out for a couple weeks now, but you'll have to excuse me for doing it again here because I just saw it last weekend and, yeah, it's just as fantastic as everyone's saying: scary, smart, hilarious, and surprisingly thrilling.\nPeele tweeted that you have to see the movie \"with the theater energy\" or \"you'll miss the full intended experience.\" And he's definitely right \u2014 the movie is designed to elicit communal cheers, shrieks, and laugher. After one point in the movie, the audience I was in began laughing at itself for getting so freaked out about a simple scare. That all said, The Outline has a very good piece on why different theaters could deliver very different experiences, which I'd encourage you to read if you're planning to see it.\nCheck out 11 trailers from this week below.\n\nThe Fate of the Furious\nReferences to family: 3Grenades caught: 1Torpedos caught: 1Cars wrecked: all of them.\n\nDeadpool 2\nUm, NSFW.\n\nAtomic Blonde\nI'm pretty sure the pitch for this was \"John Wick, but we get Charlize Theron instead.\" (Like, seriously, it's directed by a guy who co-directed John Wick.) The film looks good in all the ways that John Wick looks good, but I will also drop a link here that I think may be interesting further reading. The film comes out July 28th.\n\nThe Get Down\nNetflix's big and elaborate series about the 1970s music scene in New York is returning for the second part of its first season. Though production was reportedly pretty rocky, reviews were generally positive of its first episodes. You've got a month to catch up \u2014 the rest of the season comes out on April 7th.\n\nRough Night\nFrequent Broad City writer and director Lucia Aniello is behind Rough Night, which starts out looking like a raunchy comedy about a bachelorette party but takes a much more ridiculous turn after the women accidentally kill a guy. Scarlett Johansson stars alongside Kate McKinnon, Ilana Glazer, Jillian Bell, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz. It comes out June 16th.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale \nIt certainly seems like Hulu has something exciting on its hands with The Handmaid's Tale, and so far it hasn't been eager to spoil much. This week, we got another very short look at the upcoming series and its stylish, moody look. It comes to Hulu on April 26th.\n\nMost Hated Woman in America\nNetflix is featuring one heck of a strange and wild story in Most Hated Woman in America. The film is about Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who led the charge against prayer in public schools, became an activist for atheism, and was eventually kidnapped \u2014 which seems to be the part of her life being explored here. The film comes out March 24th.\n\nLady Macbeth\nEvery trailer for Lady Macbeth looks more and more chilling. The film is an adaptation of an 1800s Russian novel about a woman forced into marriage who eventually decides to do something about it. And it appears to turn pretty dark. The film comes out April 28th in the UK and July 14th in the US.\n\nLittle Boxes\nA couple and their 6th-grade son deal with the strangeness and not-so-subtle racism of a small town in Little Boxes. From this trailer, the film looks eccentric, cringe-inducing, and full of energy. It comes out April 14th.\n\nLive Cargo\nLive Cargo got some warm reviews out of Tribeca last year, and I'm really loving the look of it from this first trailer. It\u2019s a moody piece about a couple on a vacation of sorts who get caught up in some criminal schemes on a remote island. At least check it out for the great visuals. The film comes out March 31st.\n\nGeostorm\nImagine The Day After Tomorrow, but also that movie where The Rock takes on an earthquake, and also Twister, and also basically every natural disaster movie packed into one. Sound good?\n"}
