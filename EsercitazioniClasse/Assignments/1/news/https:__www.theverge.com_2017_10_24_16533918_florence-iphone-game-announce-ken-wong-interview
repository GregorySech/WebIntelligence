{"title": "Florence is a game about love from the designer behind Monument Valley", "content": " \nLate last year, Annapurna \u2014 the film production company behind movies like Her and American Hustle \u2014 announced that it was getting into games with a new interactive division, with a slate that included the next release from Ken Wong, lead designer on the original Monument Valley. (Wong had just recently set out to launch his own studio, called Mountains.) Now Wong is finally ready to reveal the studio\u2019s first release: Florence, a visual novel about relationships and love. While it may look quite a bit different than the impossible architecture Wong is known for, the two games share at least a few ideals in common. \u201cIt\u2019s designed for an audience that doesn\u2019t play games a lot,\u201d says Wong, \u201cand maybe feels some trepidation about playing games.\u201d\nFlorence tells the story of 25-year-old Florence, who is stuck in a familiar routine, with a life that revolves around work and wasting time on social media. The game follows her budding relationship with a young cellist, as the two grow closer and go through the highs and lows of falling in love. It\u2019s described as a \u201cshort narrative game,\u201d inspired in large part by slice-of-life graphic novels. Florence is divided into a series of chapters, each of which plays differently, with game mechanics designed around the particulars of the scene, whether it\u2019s flirting or fighting.\n\u201cI\u2019m still very interested in making games for a broad audience.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a structure that sounds reminiscent of What Remains of Edith Finch, a game that similarly introduced a range of interactions to tell a number of short, very distinct stories. Wong describes Florence as being \u201clike a collection of mini-games where in every chapter we\u2019ve designed custom gameplay around trying to evoke the emotions of the different stages of a relationship.\u201d\nFor Wong and the rest of the team at Melbourne-based Mountains, a studio that is currently home to four creators, the journey to Florence started with deciding who they wanted to make games for. \u201cI wanted to continue some of the threads that we\u2019d been talking about at [Monument Valley developer] Ustwo,\u201d Wong says. \u201cI was interested in making non-violent games. I think violent games are great, I grew up with them, but there are enough of those in the world. And I wanted to explore what kind of stories and what kind of dynamics we can get without resorting to violence. I\u2019m still very interested in making games for a broad audience, especially people who don\u2019t normally play games.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimbing a new mountain\nIn addition to making a new game, Wong has also spent the past year and a half creating a new studio. And much of that time, he says, was spent figuring out the kind of culture he wanted to impart of the fledgling team. \u201cI took this opportunity of starting a studio from scratch to say: we\u2019re going to put people first, we\u2019re going to put the emphasis on having a healthy lifestyle and communicating well, and making sure that everybody is taking care of themselves and looking after each other,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the best way to make games.\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason the game will be coming to mobile. Though the studio is keeping many details secret for now, Florence will be launching sometime next year, and will be available on Apple devices. In many ways, it\u2019s a continuation of the work Wong did on Monument Valley. It was a game that managed to reach a massive, mainstream audience \u2014 it\u2019s been downloaded more than 30 million times to date, and was even featured in an episode of House of Cards \u2014 thanks to a combination of platform, distinctly beautiful visuals, and approachable gameplay. With Florence, Mountains is trying to do something similar. It has an art style that looks like a moving comic book, and interactions that don\u2019t need to be explained through lengthy tutorials. Of course, the popularity of Wong\u2019s past work also means some comparisons will be inevitable, no matter how different the two games end up being.\n\u201cWe have this big spectre of in some ways following up Monument Valley,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously, my three new team members were not on the Monument Valley team, but it did feel like the shadow of Monument Valley helped start the studio and in some ways this would be talked about in comparison to that. There were a lot of things that I was thinking about, in terms of what would be exciting to work on, and a lot of that comes from the touchscreen and the mobile platform. Just like with Monument Valley, I think that designing a great game means acknowledging the platform you\u2019re on and all of the dynamics of it.\u201d\nThere are other similarities. While Monument Valley was best-understood as a puzzle game, it also told a story, using sparse dialogue and short sequences to build a narrative. Florence is a more story-focused experience, but it similarly pares things back a great deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t have words in the game,\u201d says Wong. \u201cThere\u2019s no dialogue or narration. It plays out a bit like a comic without words, which I\u2019m a fan of, but also a but like a silent movie or a music video, where you\u2019re going to be reading a lot into body language and how these characters move throughout the world and looking through their possessions.\u201d\nFor the team at Mountains, mobile was the perfect avenue for this kind of game, where they can potentially reach an audience that might not otherwise care about games, but is maybe intrigued by this app that looks like a comic book about love. \u201cI think mobile is still untapped,\u201d says Wong. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity for different experiences. You look at Pok\u00e9mon Go, or the recent blossoming AR experiments. The kinds of genres you get on mobile are so different. For me it\u2019s a really rich design space, where I think I can contribute to making games that haven\u2019t been made before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
