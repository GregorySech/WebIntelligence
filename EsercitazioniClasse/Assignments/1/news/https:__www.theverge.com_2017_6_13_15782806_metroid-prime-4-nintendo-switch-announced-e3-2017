{"title": "Metroid Prime 4 is coming to Nintendo Switch", "content": " \nTake a deep breath: Nintendo is actually making a new Metroid game. At its E3 spotlight today, the company officially unveiled Metroid Prime 4, the latest entry in the beloved sci-fi exploration series. Unfortunately, outside of the name and the fact that it\u2019s coming to Nintendo Switch, we know nothing about the game itself.\nThe new game will mark the first entry in the Prime series in a decade, as the original trilogy concluded with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the original Wii in 2007. The Prime subseries debuted on the GameCube in 2002, and was especially notable for successfully translating the iconic, moody exploration of the original Metroid games into a three-dimensional, first-person experience.\nHowever, since the Prime trilogy wrapped up, it\u2019s been tough times for Metroid fans. The most recent game in the series \u2014 Metroid Prime: Federation Force on 3DS \u2014 was a mostly forgettable shooter that had little of what made the series so iconic in the first place.\nNo release window has been announced for Prime 4, but given the sparse details available, the game is likely still fairly early in development.\n"}
