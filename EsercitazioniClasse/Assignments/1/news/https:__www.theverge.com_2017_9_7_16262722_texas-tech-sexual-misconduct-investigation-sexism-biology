{"title": "When Texas Tech investigated sexist behavior, it found no one to blame", "content": " \nAfter The Verge reported last October that Texas Tech University\u2019s biological sciences department was allegedly a hostile environment for female students, the Texas Tech administration launched an official investigation. Although the investigation was completed last spring, the university only publicly released the findings last month. To the dismay of many biology students and faculty, officials essentially exonerated the department of charges of sexism and sexual harassment.\nOfficials essentially exonerated the department\nThe findings, which many see as whitewashed, dashed many hopes that the biology department at Texas Tech might be turning a corner in its long history of alleged sexist attitudes. The investigation was launched after the department chair, Ronald Chesser, had been caught on video making sexist remarks at a October 2015 retirement party. The party was for Robert Baker, a famed mammalogist whom some students called a \u201cdirty old man\u201d for his alleged decades-long habit of sexually harassing both graduate and undergraduate students. Another faculty member, Lou Densmore, had allegedly hosted sex-themed Christmas parties at his home, which some students felt pressured to attend. But while Chesser was formally suspended from his post for several months during the investigation, last April the department\u2019s several dozen faculty voted two-to-one to reinstate him.\nTo make matters worse, during a hastily organized meeting with students last May, John Zak, a biologist and associate dean who acted as interim chair after Chesser\u2019s suspension, seemed unaware of the university\u2019s formal procedures for reporting sexual harassment. To the students\u2019 amazement, he reportedly said that they should take complaints either to Chesser, to Densmore (who is currently the graduate advisor), or to Zak himself.\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that students are afraid to speak up.\u201d\n\u201cMany of the graduate students are upset and worried that everything is going to be swept under the rug,\u201d says Marina Fisher-Phelps, a graduate student who just received her PhD from the department this summer and has now left Texas Tech. \u201cWe are very angry about this. The biggest problem is that students are afraid to speak up because of repercussions within the department and in our future careers.\u201d A number of current and former biology students told The Verge that they did not cooperate with the investigation, which was carried out by Texas Tech\u2019s Office of General Counsel and its Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), because they feared retaliation.\nThe students \u201care all terrified of the consequences,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\nA dark, disgusting joke: Megalabia\nLast October, The Verge reported on an alleged pattern of sexism and sexual harassment in Texas Tech University's biological sciences department. The report included details of sexist remarks that were made at a retirement party for the well-known mammalogist Robert Baker in October 2015 (see main text.) Those remarks, captured on video, were the main instigator for an investigation the university subsequently carried out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMegalabia\u201d parody paper\n\n\nBut at the time, this publication was unaware of a highly sexist parody scientific paper that was also distributed at the retirement event. The paper was published under the supposed auspices of the \u201cIllusional Papers,\u201d a comic reference to the \u201cOccasional Papers\u201d published by Texas Tech\u2019s Natural Science Research Laboratory (NSRL), to which several biology faculty also belong. The title, \u201cEvolutionary Origin, Natural History, Biogeography, and Phylogenetic Relationships of a New Species of MEGALABIA,\u201d was a crude but elaborate joke about female genitalia, and its text and illustrations riffed on that theme. The paper described new sightings of \u201cMegalabia\u201d \u2014 depicted in a drawing as a naked human female with long curly hair and wings\u2014and described the anatomical structure of its supposed genitalia in detail. \nThe first author of the paper is listed as Robert Baker, with current biology department chair Ronald Chesser as second author, followed by several former biology students as coauthors. The paper was reportedly made available on a table near the entrance to the auditorium, and Robert Bradley \u2014 a senior Texas Tech mammalogist and associate chair of the department, who emceed the event \u2014 drew the participants\u2019 attention to it and urged them to take copies, according to sources who attended the retirement party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection of the \u201cMegalabia\u201d parody paper\n\n\nBradley did not respond to repeated requests to explain the origins and purpose of the Megalabia paper, and why it was distributed to an audience that included both adults and young children; nor have other university officials responded to repeated questions about it. However, a comment from a pseudonymous editor of the paper, appended to the end of it, notes that it is \u201ca long-lost article that documents the Baker years at their finest.\u201d\nAs it turns out, the Megalabia paper does help chronicle the long history of sexism among some department students and faculty. According to one of the \u201ccoauthors,\u201d Craig Hood, a former Baker graduate student now at Loyola University in New Orleans, the paper was originally prepared in 1982 in what he and others thought at the time was a joke. \u201cI did play a big role in creating it,\u201d Hood admits. But, he adds, \u201cthat was a wrong thing to do, and also inappropriate.\u201d Hood also contends that neither Baker nor Chesser were involved in creating the paper, although it clearly had remained in the institutional memory of the biology department for more than three decades. \u201cI heard that some kind of copy of it was going to be there, but I wasn\u2019t part of making that happen,\u201d says Hood, who did not attend the retirement party himself. According to a source familiar with events, the original paper was reproduced at the NSRL and given a new date of October 17th, 2015, the day of the retirement party.\nUniversity officials have not responded to numerous requests for comment on the Megalabia paper, nor to questions about whether they were aware of it during their investigation. Chesser, for his part, disavows all responsibility for it. \u201cI was appalled to see my name added to the document,\u201d he says. Perhaps a new, independent investigation could determine exactly who was responsible for its preparation, and why this grossly sexist exhibit was thought fit to hand out to members of Texas Tech\u2019s biology department and their families.\n\n\nThe university\u2019s exoneration of its biology department comes even as new evidence has emerged about ingrained sexist attitudes among some of its faculty, including the distribution of a parody scientific paper at Baker\u2019s retirement party heralding discoveries of a primate dubbed \u201cMegalabia,\u201d a crude reference to female genitalia (see sidebar.)\nThe Verge\u2019s own investigation into charges of sexism at Texas Tech took place last year. Our inquiry began with allegations that Miguel Pinto, a researcher formerly at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) in Washington, DC, had sexually assaulted a NMNH student. Pinto had done some of his graduate work in Baker\u2019s lab, and had been disciplined in 2008 for sexual misconduct with an undergraduate while there. Zak, who was department chair at that time, let Pinto off with a verbal warning, and took no other action. (The NMNH later banned Pinto from working in its labs, shortly after The Verge\u2019s report appeared. ) \nAs a result of The Verge\u2019s report, which included video excerpts of sexist remarks made at Baker\u2019s retirement party, Texas Tech launched an investigation into three related issues: the allegations of sexism and sexual harassment against Baker; the overall claims of gender bias in the biology department; and the content of the video of Baker\u2019s retirement party.\nThe university\u2019s investigation almost completely exonerated both Baker and the department. A summary of the findings, posted on the biological sciences department website and attributed to Texas Tech\u2019s president, Lawrence Schovanec, explained why. \u201cThe inquiry did not reveal any formal or informal allegations of a sexual nature against Dr. Baker,\u201d the report concludes, \u201cnor did anyone come forward with anecdotal information of inappropriate sexual conduct by Dr. Baker\u2026\u201d As for whether or not there was \u201can atmosphere of gender bias in the Biology Department,\u201d the inquiry found in the negative other than \u201ca very few remote isolated statements that were addressed at the time they were made..\u201d The report did not elaborate on those episodes, nor did it make any mention of Densmore and his alleged parties.\nThe investigators did conclude that the remarks at the retirement party \u2014 by Chesser and a former Baker graduate student  \u2014 were \u201cinappropriate and offensive.\u201d However, the investigators said, they \u201cdo not reflect an atmosphere of sexual bias in the Biology Department, nor do they reflect a pattern of inappropriate sexual bias, conduct, or attitudes by either Dr. Baker or the speakers on the video.\u201d\nAlthough students and faculty have known about these conclusions for months, Texas Tech officials only released the findings publicly on August 14th, after being made aware that The Verge planned to follow up on the first story. The university may have absolved the biology department and its faculty of wrongdoing, but as a result, new sources have emerged to testify to the department\u2019s sexist history, as well as to the cavalier attitude with which they say the university has treated student concerns. Moreover, the grossly sexist \u201cMegalabia\u201d parody paper distributed at the retirement party was apparently ignored by the university investigation.\nThough Texas Tech says its biology department doesn\u2019t harbor sexist attitudes, plenty of current and former members of the department disagree. On October 29, for example, less than a week after the article\u2019s publication, mammalogist Adam Ferguson, a former graduate student in the department who is now collection manager for mammals at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, posted his own thoughts on his public Facebook page:\n\u201cThere is not a mammalogist out there that does not know Baker treats female scientists differently than male scientists, despite what he and Chesser say in the article. Everyone at [Texas Tech] sure knew it, including male and female faculty and students, but, we all chose to ignore it or laugh it off.\u201d Ferguson added that he \u201csaw firsthand and spoke with several students about instances of inappropriate behavior, behavior that goes beyond back rubs and awkward hugs, but I chose to do nothing.\u201d\nFisher-Phelps, the outgoing graduate student, describes her own experiences with Baker. \u201cHe liked to unnecessarily touch female graduate students, including myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI also saw him do this with female undergraduates. He also liked to talk about women in a sexual way. I was in a meeting with him and he started talking about this female scientist he knew. How gorgeous she was and how if she wore this red dress to a meeting with him, he knew that \u2018it was on.\u2019\u201d\nAnother former graduate student, who asked not to be identified, recalls being at a scientific meeting with Baker and walking by him at one point. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hello, big tits,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cHe thought that was okay.\u201d On other occasions, she says, Baker, who is married, would ask \u201cWhen are you going to run away with me?\u201d\nThis same former student describes the \u201chugs\u201d that Baker was notorious for giving to both graduate and undergraduate females. \u201cHis motive was to press his body firmly against a female student, lingeringly, so he could feel her body more thoroughly. We all knew why he did it. It made women uncomfortable, but what are you going to do? Baker wielded much power in the circle of mammalogy and in the biological sciences department. You did not cross him.\u201d\n\u201cYou did not cross him.\u201d\nBaker, in an interview last year, denied all of the allegations concerning him, including charges that he hugged students in an inappropriate way. The Verge reached him again by telephone at his home in Lubbock, 10 days after the university posted the findings of the investigation on the biological sciences website. Baker said that no one at Texas Tech had yet told him that the investigators had exonerated him of wrongdoing. Asked to respond to the new round of allegations, Baker would not confirm nor deny that he had commented on the size of women\u2019s breasts or deliberately pressed women\u2019s bodies to his own. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he answered. Baker said that he was unaware that he had made women uncomfortable and \u201cnever tried to do that.\u201d He insisted that he had \u201ctreated all the women equally\u201d and \u201calways tried to look out for them\u201d and help them advance in their careers.\nBeyond Baker, there\u2019s also Densmore\u2019s sex-themed Christmas parties, which both students and faculty attended. These allegedly involved exchanges of sex toys and other kinds of erotica. One former student describes the first time she attended. \u201cI had the idea that it would be gifts that were maybe off-color or mildly sexual in a funny way, but it was really, really raunchy,\u201d she says. Another former student says, \u201cAt first I felt privileged to be invited, but after a while it became very uncomfortable for me and other women I knew.\u201c She and others explained that the parties reinforced the sexist culture in the biological sciences department, which also included habitual posting of photos from Hustler, Playboy and other magazines by graduate students in biology halls and labs. \n\u201cIt was really, really raunchy.\u201d\nAlthough three individuals have now told The Verge that they attended the parties, Densmore denies that they took place. \u201cI have had no \u2018sex-themed\u2019 parties at my home, nor have I attended any,\u201d he says.\nMeanwhile, on November 23rd a group of 16 Texas Tech biology faculty members sent an open letter to this reporter, expressing their unhappiness with the sexist remarks on the video. \u201cThe lighthearted portrayal of sexual harassment in this video is appalling and antithetical to our beliefs about how faculty should treat students or any other members of our community,\u201d the faculty wrote. \u201cThe fact that the offensive statements were intended as jokes does not reduce their offensiveness.\u201d\n\n\nVideo from Robert Baker\u2019s retirement party\n\nIn an email accompanying the letter, Sean Rice, an evolutionary biologist who organized its preparation, suggested that more of the department\u2019s 41 faculty members would have signed it but that \u201csome members of the faculty, especially those without tenure, might reasonably feel uneasy about signing a statement of this sort.\u201d (Only one of the biology department\u2019s 11 women signed the letter.)\nIt became clear that the investigators would have difficulty getting witnesses to talk to them\nFor its original story, many current and former students and faculty talked to The Verge about the long history of sexism in the biology department. But as the university\u2019s inquiry got under way, it became clear that the investigators would have difficulty getting witnesses to talk to them. Early in the process, Texas Tech\u2019s vice chancellor and general counsel, John Huffaker, contacted me, asking me to encourage my confidential sources to talk to his team. Although I agreed to post this request on my personal blog, I also pointed out that I could not in good conscience directly suggest to sources who feared retaliation that they put themselves in danger. Huffaker\u2019s request is noted in the university\u2019s public statement, along with an ambiguous comment suggesting that no one volunteered to be interviewed.\nThe email trail of the investigation\u2019s progress raises serious questions about just how hard the investigators really tried to talk to potential witnesses. Although the university\u2019s public statement claims that investigators sent \u201cmultiple requests\u201d to \u201cBiology Department faculty, staff, and graduate students to be interviewed as part of the inquiry,\u201d students and faculty told The Verge that the requests were minimal and only came very late in the investigation. Thus on January 27th, Victor Mellinger, Texas Tech\u2019s deputy general counsel, sent an email addressed to biology faculty and staff describing the investigation and asking anyone \u201cwho may have relevant information, or who may know someone having such information,\u201d to either contact him or Charlotte Bingham of the university\u2019s EEO Office no later than February 3rd. An identical email from Mellinger did not go out to the department\u2019s graduate students until January 31st,  with the same February 3rd deadline.\nThe grad students, who are the most important targets and witnesses of alleged sexual harassment, say they were given only three days to come forward. Moreover, students say, this January 31st email from Mellinger was the first time they were told that they could provide information confidentially. Although Mellinger\u2019s email stated that a February 3rd deadline had been set \u201cin order for us to complete the inquiry as quickly as possible,\u201d it did not explain why the investigators were suddenly in such a hurry.  \nThe grad students were given only three days to come forward\nNor is there any evidence that the investigators tried to contact former members of the department, including Baker\u2019s students, even though the allegations included episodes that went back many years. Since the investigation was made public on August 14th, The Verge has spoken to several former graduate students, all easily reached at their current institutions. None had heard from investigators. \u201cI was not contacted during the investigation,\u201d said one former Baker student. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was one. I don\u2019t recall anyone I know mentioning it either.\u201d\nBut Huffaker insisted in an email to The Verge that the investigation \u201cwas done in an appropriate manner.\u201d Huffaker contested the statement of the students that they were not made \u201caware of the possibility of talking to\u201d the investigators before January 31st,  insisting that they were \u201cinvited to provide information in the fall of 2016, and several comments were received in the fall.\u201d Huffaker declined, however, to make emails or other documentation available that would back up this claim, despite being informed that The Verge was already in possession of a number of emails provided by both students and faculty. Huffaker also declined to answer questions about why former students in the department were not contacted, and questions about the Megalabia paper and whether the investigators had known about it. He did, however, say that his office was still interested in hearing from faculty, staff or students who had \u201cconcerns\u201d about the biological sciences department.\nBy early April, the investigation was formally completed, and the administration presented the results to biology faculty in a meeting on April 6th. According to faculty present at the meeting, the results were similar to those reported in the public statement last week, with one addition: while the faculty were told that there was no evidence of serious misbehavior by Baker, the investigators did report that he was sometimes \u201ctoo familiar\u201d with female students and hugged them too often.\nSeveral scientists present at the meeting pointed out the investigation wasn\u2019t persuasive\nSeveral scientists present at the meeting pointed out the investigation wasn\u2019t persuasive, says one faculty member who asked not to be identified. That\u2019s because vulnerable students had not been given clear-cut promises of confidentiality or protection from retaliation \u2014 a concern the students themselves have expressed. Even when reassurances were offered, some students say, they were not believed. University officials were evasive when asked if and when the conclusions would be published, raising further doubts that the administration really wanted to get at the truth, say sources in the department.\nDays later, the faculty was asked to hold a secret vote on whether Chesser should be reinstated. The results, announced to the faculty on April 12th, were 23-to-13 in favor of reinstatement, and Chesser resumed his duties as chair the following day. This came as a keen disappointment to those who felt that, as one faculty member put it, the video was \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d (It also came as a surprise to many students, who found out when they received an email from the department hailing the \u201cGood news!\u201d) But he and some others speculate that many faculty did not want to have to search for a new chair, especially since Chesser had only recently been appointed to the post. In fact, faculty and student sources in the department told The Verge, Chesser\u2019s suspension was actually a sham, as he reportedly continued to sign documents and work from the department chair\u2019s office during most of the time that Zak was supposedly acting as interim chair.\nAnother faculty member, who asked not to be identified, says that some senior members of the department actively discouraged colleagues from speaking out about the video. \u201cWhile many felt that the content of the video constituted a damaging statement about our department, others thought it was no big deal and would quickly blow over,\u201d this researcher says.\n\u201cThe offensive statements in the video do not reflect an atmosphere of sexual bias\u201d \nBrent Lindquist, the dean of Texas Tech\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences, who bore ultimate responsibility for signing off on Chesser\u2019s reinstatement, told The Verge that \u201cthe offensive statements in the video do not reflect an atmosphere of sexual bias\u201d in the biology department. Lindquist adds that he \u201cdiscussed the inappropriateness of certain content in the video with Dr. Chesser to ensure this does not happen again\u201d and that Chesser has since undergone training about discrimination and sexual harassment.\nWhile the faculty were told about the investigation\u2019s conclusions, students in the department were not. A month later, Zak, in response to questions from students, finally called a meeting for May 8th. He gave students a weekend\u2019s notice and scheduled the meeting at the end of the day on a Monday, a time considered inconvenient by many. Nevertheless about 40 students attended. By all accounts it was not a happy occasion. \u201cDr. Zak made statements that downplayed the seriousness of sexual harassment and even said that sometimes in life we will encounter people with certain behavioral traits, and that we just need to learn to deal with them,\u201d says Fisher-Phelps. She also described Zak\u2019s apparent ignorance of the university\u2019s sexual harassment reporting procedures, and his advice to take complaints to Chesser, Densmore, or himself. (Zak declined to be interviewed for this article, referring queries to the university\u2019s communications manager.)\nThis account is backed up in detail by a second graduate student who attended the meeting, who asked not to be identified. This student adds that \u201cmost people displayed great dismay when they said there were no findings against Baker, that\u2019s such obvious in-your-face bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cI and many other students were very upset\u201d\nThis same source also confirms that Zak did not tell the students about formal procedures in place at the university, such as Title IX of the US education code and the Texas Tech EEO office, that would bypass department faculty. And in an exchange that the students found particularly galling, Zak explained that sexual harassment training would now be required of everyone in the department, and that graduate students might be denied teaching or research assistantships if they failed to take it. But Fisher-Phelps says that when Zak was asked what the penalties would be for faculty who failed to undergo the training, \u201che laughed and said, well, maybe teach more classes? And laughed again. I and many other students were very upset at this seeming disregard for our concerns.\u201d\nZak\u2019s apparent lack of knowledge about the university\u2019s obligations under Title IX to provide a safe space for students, faculty and employees to report harassment seems very surprising. \u201cIt is certainly concerning to hear that someone in a position of authority, leadership, or responsibility at a university would not be well versed in the way a school handles any issue involving sex discrimination, including sexual harassment,\u201d says Anne Hedgepeth, the interim vice president of public policy and government relations for the American Association of University Women (AAUW.)\nHedgepeth adds that for a university leader to make light of sexual harassment is equally worrying. \u201cThe idea that sexual harassment or sex discrimination is not a big deal reflects really deep mores in our society, a very persistent environment that we see women scholars have to navigate.\u201d\nSage Carson, project manager of the advocacy network Know Your IX, agrees. \u201cThe Department of Education says that employees should be trained about Title IX procedures,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWe see an increase in the reporting of incidents when the policy and guidelines are clearly laid out.\u201d\nChesser wrote several letters, apologizing for his comments in the video\nLast fall, while waiting to learn of his fate as department chair, Chesser wrote several letters to his fellow faculty members, apologizing for his comments in the video. Chesser reminded them of his own long and illustrious scientific career, and defended Baker as a major researcher who \u2014 as he put it in one letter \u2014 never treated his students \u201cwith anything but complete respect...\u201d Chesser insisted that he did not intend his presentation in the video to be anything other than a \u201croast\u201d of his colleague and not a representation of Baker\u2019s own views.\nChesser repeated these sentiments in an email he sent to The Verge on August 14th. \u201cI have been deeply sorry that my comments offended or embarrassed anyone other than Dr. Baker,\u201d he wrote, adding that he \u201ccan guarantee it will not happen again.\u201d\nBut the question remains: If Ronald Chesser\u2019s sexist remarks at the retirement party did not reflect his own views, and if they did not reflect Robert Baker\u2019s views, then whose views did they represent? If Chesser and the university are to be believed, sexism occurred without any sexists in sight. But that doesn\u2019t jibe with the evidence accumulated over the last year, which suggests that  sexism was rife in the Texas Tech biology department, especially among some of its most senior faculty. \u201cSome women did survive the experience, and went on to do great things,\u201d says one former graduate student who spent many years there. \u201cBut to a large extent, it was an old boys\u2019 club.\u201d\nThat might now be changing, as the university recruits younger faculty who are more committed to creating a welcoming environment for all students. The majority of the 16 scientists who signed the open letter criticizing the sexist remarks at Baker\u2019s retirement party are from the biology department\u2019s younger ranks. Unfortunately, however, the senior professors \u2014 including Chesser, Densmore, Bradley, Zak, and until recently, Baker (who still exerts considerable power in the field of mammalogy) \u2014 are still in charge.\nThus, it seems the university\u2019s investigation was na\u00efve and incompetent at best, and a clumsy attempt at a cover-up at worst. In light of a new round of allegations about sexism in its biology department, perhaps the university will finally sponsor a serious investigation \u2014 for example, involving an independent, outside contractor as some other institutions have done \u2014 that will really get at the truth. Only then will students and faculty be able to have confidence that Texas Tech is a safe place for men and women alike. \n"}
