{"title": "Luma is the latest router company to push a subscription service", "content": " \nLuma has become the latest router company to introduce a subscription service in a push to generate steady income from a new breed of mesh routers. The Luma Guardian service is being sold as the \u201cworld\u2019s first personal IT team,\u201d which is a bit of a stretch. It includes a VPN to create encrypted privacy for all attached devices, Webroot SecureAnywhere anti-virus protection for up to three devices, monthly ISP Speed monitoring reports, and priority phone support for subscribers who pay the $5 per month fee.\nMesh routers, like Luma, are usually sold in packs of two or three in order to blanket homes with Wi-Fi. The relatively tiny units are spread around the house to get faster, more stable connections without any dead spots. Eero announced its own subscription model a few week ago, which charges $9.99 per month or $99 per year for a security service with parental controls. \nIt should be noted that router owners could save on fees by installing their own VPN and anti-virus software, and running a periodic ISP speed test. Then again, many would prefer to pay someone else to do it for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuma\u2019s app\nPhoto: Luma\n\n\nMany of the new router companies are backed by venture capital, including Luma. Luma is backed by Amazon, Accel Partners, Felicis Ventures, GV, and others. Subscription plans are one of the most lucrative business models because, let\u2019s face it \u2014 most people don\u2019t purchase a new router very often. And with election and account hacking very much in the news lately, we\u2019ll likely be seeing more and more subscription services marketed by router companies in order to capitalize on those security fears. \n"}
