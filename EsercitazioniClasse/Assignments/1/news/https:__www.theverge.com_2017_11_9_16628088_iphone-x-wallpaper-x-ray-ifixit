{"title": "Here\u2019s a cool see-through iPhone X wallpaper that shows off its innards", "content": " If you\u2019re the proud owner of a new iPhone X but are stumped on which wallpaper to display on that beautiful screen, iFixit has released some pretty nice see-through options. Fresh from its teardown, iFixit has given users two high-resolution wallpaper options, including one that shows what\u2019s inside the iPhone X and another that\u2019s an X-ray version. The standard wallpaper shows the battery cells, haptic engine, and dual camera. You can download them from iFixit\u2019s site. To set them as your wallpaper, save the photo at full resolution then select wallpaper from your iPhone\u2019s Settings menu, tap \u201cchoose a new wallpaper,\u201d then select the photo you saved. You can also select either Still or Perspective  which zooms in slightly so the wallpaper moves when you tilt your device.  Perspective mode is a good way of preventing burn-in, since the pixels of your wallpaper will shift around, rather than being fixed every time you use your phone. "}
