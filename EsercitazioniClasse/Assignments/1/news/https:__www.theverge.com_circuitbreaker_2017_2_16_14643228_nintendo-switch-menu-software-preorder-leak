{"title": "The first look at the Switch\u2019s software comes from a early preorder accident", "content": " \nThe Nintendo Switch launches in just two weeks, and today we finally got our first look at what the operating system and menus of the new console look like, thanks to NeoGAF user hiphoptherobot, who claims that their preorder accidentally shipped early.\nThe three-minute-long video goes through the initial setup of the device and shows off the new minimalist user interface that Nintendo will be debuting with the Switch. According to a post on NeoGAF, hiphoptherobot isn\u2019t connecting the device to the internet to avoid causing trouble with Nintendo for the store he bought it from. \nWithout games or online services, there\u2019s not a whole lot to see, but it\u2019s evident that Nintendo is using a more mature and subdued user interface than some of their previous console\u2019s over-designed menus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default Switch home screen.\nPhoto: hiphoptherobot (VidMe)\n\n\nOther than a simple walkthrough of how to detach the Joy-Con remotes and the knowledge that there are both black and white theme options included by default, the biggest news from hiphoptherobot is that the 32GB Switch only offers 25.9 GB of free space out of the box, with the remainder presumably taken up by the console\u2019s software. While today\u2019s unofficial UI reveal is interesting, it highlights that there\u2019s still a lot we have yet to learn about the Switch before the console\u2019s release on March 3rd. \n\nNintendo Switch: First Look\n\n\n\n\n"}
