{"title": "How to get Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com beta right now", "content": " \nMicrosoft unveiled a new Outlook.com beta yesterday, complete with a refreshed search interface and plenty of GIFs. While the software giant is planning to roll this out in stages, it appears that not many people are seeing the opt-in \u201ctry the beta\u201d toggle yet. If you\u2019re still waiting, there\u2019s actually a quick trick to get in early:\n\nLoad up Outlook.com in a browser as normal and sign into your account\nOnce loaded, navigate to the address part and replace the /owa/ section with /mail/ instead\n\nIt\u2019s as simple as that, and it will even work if you\u2019re an Outlook Premium subscriber. You\u2019ll start to see the \u201ctry the beta\u201d toggle as a result, but it won\u2019t stick if you reload Outlook.com. Navigating directly to https://outlook.live.com/mail/#/inbox should work once you\u2019ve initiated the workaround, though. Don\u2019t untick the \u201ctry the beta\u201d toggle though, as this will permanently remove you from the beta interface, even with this workaround.\nMicrosoft is collecting feedback over at the Outlook uservoice site. New features include an improved conversation view, an updated and faster search interface, GIFs and emoji input, and the ability to tag restaurants in conversations. The new interface looks a lot cleaner than the existing Outlook.com, and it better matches the Mail client for Windows 10. Microsoft is expected to roll this out broadly later this year once testing is complete.\n \n"}
