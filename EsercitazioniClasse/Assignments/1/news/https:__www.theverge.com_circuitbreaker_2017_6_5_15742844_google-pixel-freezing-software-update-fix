{"title": "Google just fixed an annoying freezing bug with its Pixel phone", "content": " \nGoogle today released its monthly security update for Pixel and Nexus devices. The security patch is rolling out over-the-air and can also be downloaded directly if you\u2019re not one for waiting. In addition to bolstering the security of its devices, Android Police points out that Google included a pretty important Pixel software fix in this update: a nasty bug that has resulted in some Pixel smartphones randomly freezing has supposedly been fixed. Well, hopefully.\nA post on Google\u2019s product forums confirms that the fix \u201cshould address many of the freezing issues that have been reported.\u201d Count me as one of the unlucky ones; my Pixel has been completely locking up at unpredictable times \u2014 at least once or twice a day \u2014 for months. And it rarely recovers or snaps out of it, so I usually have to hold down the power button for a hard reset whenever the freezes occur. (Yes, the Pixel\u2019s camera is so good that it makes putting up with this stuff worth it.) Not all Pixel devices exhibit the issue. My colleague Vlad hasn\u2019t encountered it at all, for example.  \nI\u2019m installing the OTA right now, so I\u2019m trying to be optimistic that the freezing will vanish for good. But the company warns that \u201cfreezing and general device performance issues can be caused my many different things\u201d so Google is encouraging users to report back on whether it truly alleviates the problem. \nNow if only Google could improve the Pixel\u2019s Bluetooth performance... \n"}
