{"title": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa adds support for iCloud calendars", "content": " \nAlexa can now remind you about appointments from yet another calendar service: iCloud. Devices including the Echo lineup and other Alexa-enabled gadgets have added support for iCloud calendars as of today. Amazon says that iCloud calendars have been a \u201ctop requested feature\u201d from customers, which makes sense. A whole lot of iPhone and iPad users probably create one when setting up their device out of the box. \nYou can link your iCloud account through the settings section of Amazon\u2019s mobile Alexa app. Once that\u2019s done, you can ask what\u2019s on your schedule for the day \u2014 or tell Alexa to add a new calendar entry. \nWith the addition of iCloud, Amazon now counts five \u201cmajor\u201d calendar services that Alexa works with. They are:\n\nApple iCloud Calendar accounts\nG Suite accounts\nGoogle / Gmail accounts\nOffice 365 commercial customers with Exchange Online mailboxes\nOutlook.com email accounts, including all Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live, or MSN email accounts\n\n"}
