{"title": "Flight of Passage is an incredible immersive ride through the world of Avatar", "content": " \nTheme park attractions don\u2019t normally require real suspension of disbelief. You strap into a vehicle, get swung around a bit, and then you\u2019re off and running to the next line. But when you\u2019re dealing with an entire immersive world, like Disney\u2019s new Pandora: The World of Avatar, that dynamic changes. There has to be a narrative behind the ride, an in-world reason for people to line up when they\u2019ve ostensibly traveled to an alien world known for its lush, exotic landscapes. \nPandora\u2019s flagship attraction, Flight of Passage, might as well be a case study in how to pull off that kind of challenge. It\u2019s a 3D motion simulator ride that lets visitors link to a Na\u2019vi avatar, straight from the core conceit of the film, and take an aerial tour on one of the planet\u2019s wild Banshees. It\u2019s a technological marvel, seamlessly creating the illusion of careening through valleys and soaring past floating mountains. But it\u2019s also a remarkable exercise in storytelling, linking the film to the physical park in its own unique way, resulting in one of the most immersive ride experiences I\u2019ve encountered. \n\u201cHow do we make it feel like every person is truly there?\u201d\n\u201cThere were a number of things that people really wanted to do on Pandora, and one of them was flying on the back of a Banshee,\u201d David Lester, show programmer at Walt Disney Imagineering, tells me on a busy press day. In the world of theme parks, Imagineers are the closest thing you can find to rock stars, and the company has doubled the number of Imagineer groups available to discuss Pandora in order to meet the demand. \u201cEvery decision about how to create this experience, what technology to use, was all designed with that in mind: How do we make it feel like every person engaging in this experience is truly there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first test is patience: you\u2019re going to be queuing for Flight of Passage for some time\n\n\nWith Flight of Passage, that starts with the premise of the park itself. It\u2019s been 100 years since the events featured in the film Avatar, and people now visit Pandora to learn about its exotic plants and wildlife. Years of abuse from humans harmed its fragile ecosystems, however, and a group called the Pandora Conservation Initiative has begun to track the world\u2019s various keystone species \u2014 specific animals or plants that support the ecosystem as a whole. One of those is the Banshee, known to live in Pandora\u2019s floating mountains, and as a result PCI has begin using an updated version of the avatar mind-linking technology to monitor their progress.\nThe ride actually begins long before visitors get anywhere near flying. The entrance to the attraction is essentially a waterfall-laden hiking trail, providing a glorious view of the park\u2019s massive floating mountains and the valley below. Once inside, guests find themselves inside a cave filled with old paintings from Na\u2019vi history, before discovering the remains of an old abandoned building from RDA, the mining company from the film that caused so much havoc in the first place. But as the path winds on, it\u2019s revealed that the bioluminescent jungle has already begun to creep in and devour the ruins, an incredibly detailed landscape that evokes the struggle for dominance between humanity and nature. \nThe queue was designed to accommodate a six-hour wait\nThat\u2019s really just the beginning, because the lines for Flight of Passage are expected to be long. The entire queue was designed to support around a six-hour wait time, if needed \u2014 a mind-numbing prospect \u2013 but it makes the importance of a line as an attraction unto itself even more important. I remember riding Disneyland\u2019s Indiana Jones Adventure in the 1990s, which turned the queue into a puzzle-decoding quest that featured appearances from movie characters and a set that visitors could physically move and interact with. Those elements are no longer active today, but at the time they actually left more of an impression on me than the ride itself because they told the backstory of the entire attraction. Flight of Passage takes that same basic approach, but amplifies it \u2014 particularly when the queue leads guests to the PCI research labs.\nThat\u2019s when it feels like you\u2019re almost literally stepping onto the set of Cameron\u2019s original film. A multitude of small science experiments dominate a workstation in the center of the room, while nearby an amnio tank holds a fully-grown avatar, ready to be brought out of stasis. It\u2019s impressive how much that visual grounds not just the ride, but the entire park. Cameron\u2019s Na\u2019vi were always computer-generated creations, but here they\u2019re recreated perfectly; the avatar\u2019s CG-smooth skin and subtle blue shading turned physical, and totally believable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter snaking through the labs, a few video introductions lay out how audience members will be linked to their avatars, and then they\u2019re led into the ride itself. Avatar technology has evolved to the point where the process can be performed with nothing more than a \u201clink chair\u201d \u2014 basically a bicycle-like apparatus with haptic feedback \u2014 and a pair of \u201cflight goggles\u201d that serve as 3D glasses. \nAvatar linking now requires nothing more than a special chair and a pair of goggles\nThe ride mechanics are similar to Soarin\u2019, Disney\u2019s hang-glider simulator. When it begins, audiences face a gigantic 3D screen, with the chairs pivoting and tilting to recreate the feeling of plummeting down the face of a cliff, or pulling left in a tight corkscrew around a floating mountain. Bursts of wind and sprays of mist enhance the sense of immersion, while visually it appears you\u2019re inside Avatar itself. Audiences first met Pandora and the Na\u2019vi in 3D CG environments, and returning to that kind of world in Flight of Passage feels totally organic.\nThroughput is obviously a priority \u2014 there are eight link chairs per room, two rooms per floor, and several floors for each of the four screens used in the attraction. But the four-minute ride itself is so engrossing you never really have time, nor inclination, to realize you\u2019re doing anything but flying by yourself. \n\u201cWe're illusion designers,\u201d Imagineering executive producer Amy Jupiter tells me. \u201cThe whole thing about individualized flight is that the technology is supposed to fall away. That's our job, to really help you know that you're flying on a Banshee. The first thing that says, \u2018Oh, technology!\u2019 will take you out of that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGenetic sampling\u201d to find your Avatar match\n\n\nWhile the attraction excels at conveying the thrills and adventure of aerial flight, its most magical moments are ones of calm, quiet serenity. After a particularly adventurous turn, my Banshee came to a rest in a dark cave full of bioluminescence (unlike something like Star Tours, there\u2019s only a single track in Flight of Passage). I could hear my Banshee\u2019s belabored breathing as it calmed down, but I could also feel it. The link chairs actually simulate the sides of the Banshees, so you can physically feel their breathing in slight movements between your knees. There\u2019s a comforting intimacy to it, similar to what you experience riding a horse, that bonds you to the \u201ccreature\u201d and makes the illusion come alive in a totally unique way.\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about Flight of Passage isn\u2019t the breathtaking visuals or its ability to simulate the illusion of flight. It\u2019s how it fits into and actually improves the larger experience of the physical park itself. The attraction\u2019s use of the avatar mind-projection premise and its 3D visuals are a direct link to James Cameron\u2019s 2009 film; it\u2019s as if you\u2019re actually experiencing a scene from the movie itself. But because it\u2019s wrapped in the larger conservation narrative of Pandora, it serves as glue that binds the film and theme park together. \nI could feel my Banshee breathing beneath me\nI entered the new land marveling at its flying mountains; I rode Flight of Passage in awe of Pandora\u2019s larger splendor. But I left the attraction with an entirely different context for the physical landscape that surrounded me. The terrain of the Valley of Mo\u2019ara became just that \u2014 a smaller location within this much larger world I\u2019d just seen \u2014 and that impact underscored just how powerful the illusion of immersion can be in a theme park environment.\nTalking to the team at Imagineering, of course, that seems to have been the goal all along. \u201cIt all came from the very beginning. [Imagineering executive] Joe Rohde's and James Cameron's vision for what this experience would be,\u201d Lester says. \u201cIt was challenging to balance all those pieces, but it was also our goal. That's what we do at Imagineering: try to do the impossible.\u201d\n"}
