{"title": "The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes", "content": " \nThe way you think about phone sizes is about to change. Thanks to the new Infinity Display on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the nearly bezel-free design of the LG G6, the standards we\u2019ve used to predetermine if a phone is too big or too small likely won\u2019t hold up for much longer. \nFor essentially the last six years, our understanding of phone sizes has relatively stayed the same. A phone with a 4-inch display was thought of as too small for many, but perfectly sized for some. Anything between 4.7 inches and 5.1 inches \u2014 both the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 fit into this category \u2014 has been considered the sweet spot for the past few years. And then everything over 5.5 inches \u2014 the iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Pixel XL \u2014 has been considered the pocket busters of the smartphone world, too big for many people to realistically consider.\nBigger displays, smaller phones\nBut thanks to these new edge-to-edge displays, we\u2019ve got to readjust our standards as to what is too big to use. Let\u2019s look at the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL, and the Galaxy S8:\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel XL vs. Apple iPhone 7 Plus\n\n\n\n \nSamsung Galaxy S8\nGoogle Pixel XL\nApple iPhone 7 Plus\n\n\n\n\n \nSamsung Galaxy S8\nGoogle Pixel XL\nApple iPhone 7 Plus\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Size\n5.8 inches\n5.5 inches\n5.5 inches\n\n\nDimensions (inches)\n5.9 x 2.7 x 0.31 in\n6.1 x 3.0 x 0.34 in\n6.2 x 3.1 x 0.29 in\n\n\nDimensions (millimeters)\n148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm\n154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6 mm\n158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite having a larger display than both the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus, the Galaxy S8 is notably shorter and more narrow, making it easier to hold. Even when compared to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and the 5-inch Google Pixel, the Galaxy S8 really doesn\u2019t give up much more than a few millimeters in height:\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel vs. Apple iPhone 7\n\n\n\n \nSamsung Galaxy S8\nGoogle Pixel\nApple iPhone 7\n\n\n\n\n \nSamsung Galaxy S8\nGoogle Pixel\nApple iPhone 7\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Size\n5.8 inches\n5 inches\n4.7 inches\n\n\nDimensions (inches)\n5.9 x 2.7 x 0.31 in\n5.6 x 2.7 x 0.33 in\n5.4 x 2.6 x 0.28 in\n\n\nDimensions (millimeters)\n148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm\n143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5 mm\n138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Galaxy S8 is essentially a taller Google Pixel. That\u2019s a staggering change to our concepts of how we must judge phones before we get time to actually hold them. For example, people who are looking for a new midsized phone and are considering the Galaxy S8 \u2014 5.8 inches sounds too big, but is it really?  \nEven the Galaxy S8 Plus with its seemingly massive 6.2-inch display isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility for most people, as it\u2019s nearly identical in size to the iPhone 7 Plus. And thanks to the combination of the edge-to-edge displays, curved screens, and new aspect ratios, the way we measure phone displays is also changing, as my colleague Vlad Savov explains in detail.\nSo as we go forward, with the rumors of an edge-to-edge display on the next iPhone, and the other manufacturers that will follow Samsung\u2019s trend, it may be helpful to think twice and check the dimensions of a phone with a display once considered too big to handle before you write it off. \n"}
