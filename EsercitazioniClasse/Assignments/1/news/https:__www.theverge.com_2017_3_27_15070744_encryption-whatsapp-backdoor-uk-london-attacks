{"title": "UK government renews calls for WhatsApp backdoor after London attack", "content": " \nFollowing last week\u2019s terrorist attack in London, the UK government has renewed a familiar campaign against digital encryption. Echoing criticisms made in 2015 by then prime minister David Cameron after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, UK home secretary Amber Rudd this weekend described the government\u2019s inability to read messages on end-to-end encrypted messaging apps as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d \n\u201ca secret place for terrorists to communicate\u201d\n\u201cWe need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp don\u2019t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with one another,\u201d Rudd said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. \u201cIt used to be that people would steam open envelopes or just listen in on phones [...] but in this situation we need to make sure our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.\u201d \nRudd\u2019s comments were criticized for her apparent lack of technological understanding, but they outline a familiar and global battle between governments and tech firms. After the San Bernardino attack in December 2015, the US government made similar complaints, demanding that Apple de-encrypt an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters. (They later gave up the legal battle and used a purchased exploit instead.) And in Brazil, the government has blocked WhatsApp on a number of occasions for allegedly failing to cooperate with police investigations. \nIn response to Rudd\u2019s comments, security and privacy experts outlined the dangers of introducing backdoors into encrypted apps. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said such a move would \u201cmake millions of ordinary people less secure online.\u201d He added: \u201cWe all rely on encryption to protect our ability to communicate, shop and bank safely.\u201d \nGovernment trying to \u201cuse the moment\u201d\nThe former cyber security chief of the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defense, Major General Jonathan Shaw, also criticized the move, suggesting that ministers\u2019 motivations were opportunistic. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program, Shaw said the government was trying to \u201cuse the moment\u201d to extract concessions from tech companies. He added that any encryption backdoor would only provide temporary help. \u201cThe problem will mutate and move on,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cWe are aiming at a very fluid environment here. We are in real trouble if we apply blunt weapons to this, absolutist solutions.\u201d\nAlthough many in the tech industry believe attempts to ban encryption are futile, it\u2019s not clear exactly how the UK government would proceed, and it seems unlikely that a full \u201cban\u201d would be contemplated. Following the introduction of new surveillance legislation last year, the UK has the legal justification needed to compel tech companies to de-encrypt messages, but those companies might say this isn\u2019t technically feasible or just ignore such demands. What happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cIt is difficult to see how the UK Government could force a US-based company like WhatsApp to comply,\u201d Killock told The Verge. \nRudd is expected to meet with representatives from tech companies including WhatsApp and Facebook later this week. \n"}
