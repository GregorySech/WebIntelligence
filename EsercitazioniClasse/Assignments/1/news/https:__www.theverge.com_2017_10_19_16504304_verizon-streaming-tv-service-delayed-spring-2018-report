{"title": "Verizon\u2019s streaming TV service reportedly delayed until spring 2018 at the earliest", "content": " \nVerizon has supposedly had its own over-the-top TV service in the works for a while now. Bloomberg first reported that it was supposed to launch in the summer back in March, and Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam confirmed in a Variety report that the company was working on the service in May. But those plans are apparently getting delayed even more: a new report from Bloomberg says that Verizon is now looking at a spring 2018 release date, at the earliest. \nThe most recent delay means that whenever Verizon\u2019s service does launch, it\u2019ll be considerably behind competitors like AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now, Google\u2019s YouTube TV, Sony\u2019s PlayStation Vue, and Dish\u2019s Sling TV, all of which will have months, if not years of a head start. Plus, Bloomberg\u2019s sources claim that Verizon\u2019s service will be similarly priced to competitors, so it probably won\u2019t have a competitive advantage there.   \nIf you simply must have a Verizon video app that offers prorated streaming in the defiance of net neutrality in the interim, there\u2019s still Go90. \n"}
