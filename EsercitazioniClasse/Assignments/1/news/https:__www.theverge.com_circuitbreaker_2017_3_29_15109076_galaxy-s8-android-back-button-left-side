{"title": "The Galaxy S8 finally lets you put Android\u2019s back button where it belongs", "content": " \nSamsung\u2019s shift to on-screen buttons has resulted in a beautiful bit of customization for longtime Android users: the ability to change the layout of those buttons. Yes, you\u2019re now able to move the back button to the left side of the phone, which is where it\u2019s supposed to be despite years of Samsung stubbornly switching up the default Android layout.\nAs confirmed in this video from \u201cMr. Mobile\u201d Michael Fisher, there\u2019s a settings menu in the S8 that lets you reposition the button row of buttons. You don\u2019t get much flexibility, really; you\u2019ve got to pick between Samsung\u2019s old, stupid way or the purist Android way. This is also where you\u2019ll customize how hard of a press is required to activate the virtual home button from anywhere in the operating system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Fisher / Mr. Mobile\n\n\n"}
