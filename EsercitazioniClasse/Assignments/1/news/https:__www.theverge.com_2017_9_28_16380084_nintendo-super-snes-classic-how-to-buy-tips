{"title": "How to buy Nintendo\u2019s SNES Classic on launch day", "content": " \nHeading into tomorrow\u2019s release of the $79.99 Super NES Classic Edition, the question on the minds of Nintendo fans is what supply will look like. We all remember the impossible odds of procuring an NES Classic last year, and Nintendo has stated numerous times that it has ramped up production and launch-day units this time around. \nNintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has urged consumers not to get suckered into paying exorbitant reseller prices on eBay and Craigslist. If you miss out on launch day, be patient. The company has promised to manufacture \u201csignificantly more\u201d of the miniature Super Nintendo than it did the NES Classic. \nBut odds be damned, maybe you\u2019re determined to get an SNES Classic of your own tomorrow and play it all weekend. You\u2019ve read our review. You know it\u2019s worth the cash. And that\u2019s where I come in, friends. I want to help ensure you find your way to those glorious hours of Donkey Kong Country, Star Fox 2, Super Mario World, and yes, even Super Ghouls \u2019n Ghosts. \nThe first decision to make is whether or not you\u2019re willing to drive around for one.\nI don\u2019t trust the internet and I want to buy one in real life at a store.\nGenerally speaking, all major US electronics retail chains are guaranteeing that they\u2019ll have the SNES Classic in stores on September 29th. But just like last time, everyone is also emphasizing the term \u201climited supply.\u201d \nThe approach to handling people in line is a bit different between retailers. Some are using an orderly ticketing system, and others are simply going first-come, first-served when their stores open.\nBest Buy: The go-to electronics retailer will be distributing its SNES Classics through a ticketing system. Every Best Buy location will have stock, and tickets for all available launch-day units will be distributed at 7AM to those in line. Best Buy isn\u2019t holding a midnight launch, nor is it opening early for this launch; regular business hours at most stores start at 10AM. But if you manage to get a ticket before then, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re guaranteed Nintendo\u2019s latest nostalgia gadget. \u201cWe will only pass out as many tickets as we have systems available, with a limit of one per customer,\u201d the company has confirmed.\n\n\nI would certainly recommend getting there earlier than 7am your time. Good luck! ^Alison\u2014 Best Buy Support (@BestBuySupport) September 28, 2017\n\n\n\nGameStop: Again, every location is guaranteed to have some Super NES Classic devices available on day one. GameStop isn\u2019t doing tickets, but the retailer is taking a somewhat unusual and transparent step to at least prevent people from waiting in long lines for no reason; it will post the number of consoles available right on the front door! That will happen either \u201cafter close tonight or before the stores open tomorrow\u201d depending on the store, according to a spokesperson. Also, they\u2019ll be sold individually and you won\u2019t have to buy a bundle with things you don\u2019t want. \nNintendo World NYC: Nintendo\u2019s flagship retail store in Manhattan is being pretty strict about this launch. The company is limiting SNES Classic purchases to one-per-customer. The console can only be purchased with a debit or credit card, and the name on that payment method must match the ID of whoever\u2019s buying. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll be turned away. Sales begin at 9AM.\n\n\nTo help as many fans as possible during the launch of the Super NES Classic Edition, @NintendoNYC will employ the following purchase policy. pic.twitter.com/XoKKRmkNQc\u2014 Nintendo NY (@NintendoNYC) September 27, 2017\n\n\n\nTarget: Every Target will have stock and customers in line will receive tickets for the SNES Classic before doors open. Many Target stores open a couple hours earlier than your typical Best Buy or GameStop, so it might be worth an early AM visit. \nThinkGeek: I\u2019m still bitter and ashamed that I somehow convinced myself to give ThinkGeek over $100 for an NES Classic and some stupid Tetris lamp a couple months ago, but that\u2019s a thing that happened. For the SNES Classic, ThinkGeek wants you to know that it\u2019s going to be selling the console individually without forcing customers into buying a bundle. \nToys \u201cR\u201d Us: Every store will have SNES Classics available, and a spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that every Toys \u201cR\u201d Us will be handing out tickets to line dwellers before opening. \u201cOur stores will open at normal time (9AM local) and every big-box store \u2014 not express or outlet with the exception of Times Square \u2014 will have a limited quantity of consoles. So, we recommend that gamers get in line bright and early!\u201d\nWalmart: The Super NES Classic will be available at every Walmart. For Walmarts that are open 24/7, the console will be available for purchase beginning at 12:01AM ET. Elsewhere, they\u2019ll go on sale as soon as the store opens. \nI\u2019d rather obsessively keep hitting refresh on like 14 browser tabs, thank you very much.\nUnless otherwise noted, you should be going on the assumption that online sales will start promptly at midnight or maybe a minute after. It\u2019s not clear whether every one of these stores will be selling the Super NES Classic immediately at launch, though. Best Buy and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us have already confirmed that they won\u2019t be.\nBest Buy: Best Buy won\u2019t be offering web sales of the SNES Classic \u2014 at least not on launch day. \nGameStop: Here\u2019s the link you need. Some online-only bundles may be offered if the individual console sells out. \nTarget: Here\u2019s the link you need. \nThinkGeek: Here\u2019s the link you need. \nToys \u201cR\u201d Us: \u201cRight now, we are solely selling the consoles in store,\u201d a company spokesperson told The Verge.\nWalmart: Coming soon.\nNeither of those worked! Things are looking bleak and the child inside this 30-something body is weeping. Help.\nIf you miss out on the SNES Classic right at launch, the best path to snagging one is probably with an inventory monitoring website. These services constantly check stock across numerous retailers and can send you notification when it finds the Super NES Classic available for purchase. But you\u2019ll have to act fast before it sells out again. That window can be very short. These sites are usually free to use if you\u2019re comfortable giving over your email address or phone number for in-stock alerts. \niStockNow.com \nNowInStock.net \nBrickSeek is another option that claims to provide the exact inventory available at both Target and Walmart. \n"}
