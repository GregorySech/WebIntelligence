{"title": "Google Play Music now works with Apple\u2019s CarPlay", "content": " \nI really don\u2019t know how many Android fans who\u2019ve bought into Google\u2019s ecosystem would favor CarPlay over Android Auto, but maybe Apple\u2019s in-car software is your only choice. If that\u2019s your situation, you can at least now stream from the Google Play Music iPhone app using Apple\u2019s finger-friendly in-car software, as reported by 9to5Mac. The CarPlay version of Play Music is divided into four sections: Home, Recents, Music Library, and Stations. Home is where you\u2019ll find recommendations \u2014 both based off your listening habits and other influencing factors like the time of day, your mood, or location.\nThis is Google\u2019s first app to offer CarPlay support. While you\u2019d expect Google Maps or the popular Waze to be more obvious choices, Apple doesn\u2019t currently allow navigation alternatives to Apple Maps on CarPlay. But the software definitely has plenty of choices when it comes to music: you\u2019ve got Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and now Google Play Music. \nTo get Play Music up to date for use in your car, just update to the latest version on your iPhone. \n"}
