{"title": "Syfy\u2019s pulpy space opera Dark Matter is back \u2014 here\u2019s why you should watch", "content": " \nFor years, the Syfy Channel was home to a range of space-opera TV serials like Andromeda, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, and Stargate SG-1. But after a 2009 rebranding, Syfy moved away from space shows. Three years ago, the network\u2019s programming returned to space with three new shows: Dark Matter, Killjoys, and The Expanse. \nDark Matter and Killjoys promised a return to traditional space opera: a drama following a small cast of characters as they travel from world to world. While several prestige genre stories (think American Gods, Game of Thrones, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, or Man in the High Castle) are currently on the air, shows like Dark Matter are a bit less serious, and a bit more action-packed. Syfy recently released a trailer for the show\u2019s third season, and it looks like it\u2019ll be a blast. \nWith Dark Matter returning this week, let\u2019s catch up on why it\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nWhat\u2019s this show about?\n\nDark Matter was created by Joseph Mallozzi, who used to be in charge of Syfy\u2019s Stargate franchise back when the network was called the SCI FI Channel. The show\u2019s premise is simple: six people wake up from stasis on a starship called the Raza, find they\u2019re missing their memories, and set out to learn who\u2019s responsible, who they are, and what they should do next. \nDo they learn what happened?\nThey do. This show doesn\u2019t drag out its big mysteries for long \u2014 the crew figures out their identities in the first episode. They quickly learn they\u2019re a group of criminals assigned to strong-arm a mining colony that recently had a falling-out with a company called Ferrous Corp. They ultimately decide they don\u2019t have to be bad guys or lawless enforcers any longer. They just want to get away and figure out what happened to their memories.\nWho\u2019s on the crew?\nThe show has seven main characters: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, and Android. Since the characters didn\u2019t remember their names, they named themselves for the order in which they woke up. \nEventually, they learn about their original identities. One is Jace Corso, a criminal who was part of the Raza crew. But later, he discovers he\u2019s really Derrick Moss, a wealthy tech CEO who stole Corso\u2019s identity. Two is a synthetic human named Rebecca who escaped an experimental facility and became a criminal named Portia Lin. Three is Marcus Boone, a mercenary (think Jayne from Firefly). Four is Rylo Tetsuda, the heir to the Emperor of the Principality of Zairon. Five is Das, a teenage girl and tech wizard who stowed away on board the Raza. Six is a terrorist known as Griffin Jones, but actually named Kal Varrick. He\u2019s an undercover agent working for the Galactic Authority, trying to take down the crew of the Raza. On top of that, there\u2019s Android, the ship\u2019s android, who is developing her own personality as she spends time with the crew. \nSeason 2 introduced a couple of new characters: Nyx Harper, a Seer who joins the Raza crew after they escape from prison, and Devon Taltherd, a medic who joined the crew during the same prison break. \n\nThis all seems complicated. \n\nIt really can be, but the show is largely about identities and who people truly are. Most of the characters have their own agendas, but once their memories were wiped, they found a unique opportunity to reinvent themselves. They come together into a crew because they\u2019re comfortable with one another, or at least more comfortable than they are with the wider world.\n\n\nWhere does Season 3 pick up?\n\nIn the first season, the crew largely figures out who they are, and get used to the general state of the universe. There are a lot of political factions, as well as really powerful private companies they work for, or are on the run from. The crew also discovers that they own a fantastic piece of technology called a Blink Drive, which could upend the power in the galaxy. \nIn season 2, the crew escapes from prison and split up. They eventually meet back up with some new friends, and try to figure out what they want from their new life. By the end of the season, Four essentially instigates a war, leaving the season on a cliffhanger when he abandons the Raza\u2019s crew to die. From the looks of season 3\u2019s trailer, they aren\u2019t going to take kindly to that. \nHow long is the show supposed to run?\nMallozzi says he planned out a five-year arc from the beginning, plotting out the broad beats of each season. It\u2019s not clear where the show\u2019s going to go, but some hints have been dropped along the way. \nIs this show based on anything?\nIt launched from a comic book, which was based on Mallozzi\u2019s original pitch for the show. When Stargate began to wind down, he came up with Dark Matter\u2019s premise, but didn\u2019t have any luck selling it as a series. He realized he would have more success if the series was based on an existing story, like a novel or a comic, so he turned to Dark Horse Comics, which picked up his pitch for a short, four-issue series. \nThen he used the comic as a basis for his TV pitches. In 2013, Syfy green-lit the show for a 13-episode season. The series is actually pretty different from the comic: Mallozzi noted that the comic wouldn\u2019t dictate the casting or appearance of the show, but there are some similarities. The comic also only covers the events of the pilot episode.\n\nWhat do you like about Dark Matter?\n\nAside from the fact that Syfy was overdue for more spaceship stories, what I find most appealing is how it resembles pulpy, entertaining shows like Farscape, Firefly, and Stargate. It has a cast of wildly different characters, each with their own motivations and agendas, and the show manages to cram an impressive amount of story and world-building into just a couple of seasons. This show, like Killjoys, fits in everything that makes a space-opera series fun: lots of action, fantastic worlds, interpersonal drama, and interstellar drama. It\u2019s not on the same level as The Expanse, which has some really impressive sets, acting, and story, but it\u2019s still enormously accessible and entertaining.\nWhat else is coming with Season 3? \nSyfy is jumping on the aftershow bandwagon with a companion series, After Dark, hosted by Zoie Palmer, who plays Android. It\u2019ll be available online each week after every episode. \n\nOkay, where can I watch this?\n\nThe two seasons are currently streaming on Netflix. Season three begins on June 9 on Syfy.\n"}
