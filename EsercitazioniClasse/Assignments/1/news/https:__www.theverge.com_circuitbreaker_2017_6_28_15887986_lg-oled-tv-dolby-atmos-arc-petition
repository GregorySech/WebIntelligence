{"title": "Hundreds of LG OLED TV owners are petitioning for Dolby Atmos support", "content": " \nNetflix announced today that it\u2019ll start supporting Dolby Atmos surround sound for select titles later this month, starting with Okja. That\u2019s great news: Atmos is the next generation of surround formats, using audio processing to place sounds in 3D space around you instead of just playing things through individual surround speakers.\nBut Netflix is only going to support Atmos on the Xbox One, One S, and and 2017 LG OLED TVs at first. That\u2019s a short list, which is made even worse because 2016 LG OLED TV owners have been persistently asking LG to add Atmos support to their TVs for a while now. There are long AVSForum threads, deep dives into the technical details of Atmos compatibility, and reps from streaming companies like Vudu saying they\u2019ve raised the issue with LG to no avail. It\u2019s gotten to the point where there\u2019s a Change.org petition with over 450 signatures asking for Atmos support on 2016 LG OLED TVs \u2014 which generally had starting retail prices of around $2,799. I\u2019ve asked LG about the situation and the company doesn\u2019t have an answer today, but I\u2019ll update when I hear back.\ngetting both dolby vision and dolby atmos is all but impossible\nWhy is this a problem? Because LG OLED TVs are among the few devices that support Dolby Vision HDR, but you have to use the built-in webOS apps to get it. Since the TV doesn\u2019t support sending Atmos audio out through HDMI to your speakers, you\u2019re basically stuck choosing between the best picture quality or the best audio quality on a year-old TV that cost thousands of dollars. Sure, you could buy an Xbox to get Atmos, but the Xbox doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision \u2014 just HDR10. And then you have to buy and manage another box, which seems like a silly penalty for buying LG\u2019s best TVs a year before the company added a software feature you need. And it\u2019s ridiculous that Dolby makes both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos but getting both is impossible right now unless you buy an entirely new TV.\nI know this because I have a 2016 LG B6 OLED TV, and it looks terrific, especially with Dolby Vision movies and TV shows. The webOS interface is... fine! It looks a little ridiculous at times, but it controls my Atmos-capable Denon receiver over HDMI-CEC without any problems, has all the streaming apps I need, and generally works well. I shouldn\u2019t need to add another box to the fragile mix of a working CEC setup \u2014 especially not another box that doesn\u2019t support the highest picture quality my TV offers.\nYou can have Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision but apparently not both\nAnd look, this TV is a computer. It runs an operating system originally designed for smartphones! In 2017 we expect our computers to get better over time \u2014 to have bugs fixed and new features added. Why put a smartphone OS on your TV if you\u2019re not going to update it?\nThere\u2019s some speculation out there that Atmos support is limited by the specific HDMI configuration of 2016 LG OLEDs, but none of that is confirmed, and it\u2019s not like LG didn\u2019t know Atmos was coming when it shipped and sold these TVs as its flagship models. Not designing extremely expensive consumer products that get mounted on the wall in a way that supports known future standards also seems like a huge miss.\nAnyway, there are rumors that the next-gen Apple TV will support all these advanced formats, so maybe we\u2019ll all just have to buy that in the end.\n"}
