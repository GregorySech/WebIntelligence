{"title": "Pirates pirate Pirates of the Caribbean 5 and demand ransom from Disney", "content": " \nHackers claim to have stolen the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film and are demanding that Disney pay a ransom or else have it released online, according to The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline.\nWhile there doesn\u2019t appear to be proof yet that hackers have actually taken the movie, the series of events closely mirrors what happened a few weeks ago with Orange Is the New Black, when hackers claimed to have taken the show\u2019s upcoming season and then released it after Netflix declined to pay a ransom.\nThe demand was made in Bitcoin\nThe hackers are demanding \u201can enormous amount of money,\u201d according to Deadline, and are asking that it be paid in Bitcoin, which would make it much harder to trace. The Reporter says that the hackers said they would release increasingly long chunks of the movie if their demand isn\u2019t met.\nDisney is reportedly refusing to pay and has begun working with the FBI.\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales will be the franchise\u2019s fifth entry and is supposed to enter wide release next Friday. Pirates has been a huge moneymaker for Disney, and the studio is certainly going to be concerned about anything that could cut into its box office figures.\nA few years ago, Lionsgate\u2019s The Expendables 3 leaked prior to its release and subsequently flopped at the box office. While there are some other big reasons that may have happened \u2014 like a 32 percent Rotten Tomatoes score \u2014 millions of views by pirates were cited as one possibly contributing factor.\n"}
