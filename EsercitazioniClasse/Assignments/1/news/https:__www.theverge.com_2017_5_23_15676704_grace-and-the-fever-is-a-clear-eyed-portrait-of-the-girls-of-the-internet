{"title": "Grace and the Fever is a clear-eyed portrait of \u2018the girls of the internet\u2019", "content": " \nZan Romanoff\u2019s Grace and the Fever is dedicated twice: to the \u201890s pop-rock boy band Hanson, and to \u201call the girls of the internet.\u201d \nThe novel, written for a YA audience, is centered on Grace, a teenage fan of a One Direction-inspired boy band called Fever Dream. About to graduate from high school, she\u2019s living in two worlds: the online world of fandom and a California suburb, where she can feel her friends growing away from her, and where she no longer feels like it\u2019s okay to love her pop idols out loud. Grace toggles between shame and moments of cracking out of it, asking \u201cWhat was the point of pretending to feel things she wasn\u2019t feeling, when she was capable of feeling so much?\u201d\nShe\u2019s a die-hard believer in a fan theory that two of the boys are secretly in love, and Romanoff writes this part of the story as a tight parallel to the infamous \u201cLarry Stylinson\u201d conspiracy theory. Larry Stylinson has been unfolding on Tumblr for years, with fans compiling evidence that Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson are in love based on tattoos, song lyrics, and the smallest gesture, going so far as to argue that Tomlinson\u2019s son (born in January 2016) was actually just a baby doll, or not his child at all. \nwhat if someone you spent years fantasizing about suddenly appeared in your real life?\nGrace and the Fever confronts what would happen if someone you\u2019d spent years blogging about and stewing over were to suddenly appear in your real life. What would the fallout be like? \nIt\u2019s simultaneously a smart dissection of the pitfalls of fantasy and an eager defense of it, intent on defending girls who are, in Grace\u2019s words, \u201ctired of being told they\u2019re silly or small or that they want things that aren\u2019t going to happen for them.\u201d \nThe novel is part of a conversation that\u2019s been a long time in the making, on Tumblr and Twitter, in music blogs and academic papers. Most recently, Mitski, the internet\u2019s favorite melancholy rockstar, wrote a review of Harry Styles\u2019 debut album for the music and art blog Talkhouse, dedicating significant space to the prevalence of fantasy in his solo music: \u201cPerhaps these projections put upon him have since become an authentic and natural part of him, and all of his words, even the ideals he projects onto others in his songs, are as real to him as his body.\u201d\nSimilarly, Grace and the Fever\u2019s primary concern is the tricky, slippery relationship between girls and the famous boys they love, and how much the two parties should be expected to sacrifice for the happiness of the other. To figure out how it came together, The Verge chatted with author Zan Romanoff about writing from Tumblr experiences, being a grown-up fangirl, and how the internet plays into the modern coming-of-age novel. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Penguin Random House\n\n\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nFirst off, I\u2019d love to hear a little bit of the backstory. Where did the idea for Grace and the Fever came from?\nWhen [Taylor Swift\u2019s] 1989 came out [in October 2014], I was writing an essay for the internet. I went on Tumblr and I went into the \u201cHaylor\u201d tag and was shocked to discover that pretty much everyone was saying \u201cUh, Taylor Swift never dated Harry Styles, that\u2019s a fake relationship. She\u2019s in love with Karlie Kloss, and he\u2019s in love with fellow One Direction-er Louis Tomlinson, and anyone who believes anything else is ridiculous.\u201d I was like, okay! It was the craziest thing I\u2019d ever heard and I was really fascinated. Often, if you say \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d you sort of imagine a guy in his mom\u2019s basement writing screeds about the government. You don\u2019t picture a teenage pop music fan. So I got really obsessed with the conspiracy theory known as Larry Stylinson, which then turned into me becoming a huge One Direction fan. \nOne day I read a post someone had written about how people who are in fandom could translate the skills they were learning into line items on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. So I started thinking, \u201cWhat would happen if a girl honed her detective skills on a boy band conspiracy and then encountered a larger conspiracy?\u201d\nThat is not the book I ended up writing, a book in which [the boys in the band] are like drug mules or something. That was the idea, though, and part of the problem was that the character of a hardcore conspiracy theorist is hard to make really sympathetic. I really wanted to write a book about fandom that was about how much I love fandom and how important it\u2019s been to me. I just thought that for people who weren\u2019t in fandom, if I tried to write a main character who was a really serious truther, people would not be able to get there with me. So I walked that back a little bit. \nThe real simple version of this is that I had all of this stuff going on in my head and then Zayn [Malik] left the band. I saw this picture of him in Heathrow. It\u2019s taken from above, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of people around him, but you can\u2019t see any of them. It looks like he\u2019s just walking alone through Heathrow in the middle of the night. And I had this moment where I was like, \u201coh my god.\u201d I had already been thinking a lot about celebrity and boy bands and persona and all this stuff, and I thought, \u201cWhat if one of these guys just walked into your life, and all of a sudden you had to deal with the person he actually is, and not the story you\u2019ve built up for yourself?\u201d \n\nhttp://clevernessoflarry.tumblr.com/post/160248352323/sweet-creature-sweet-creature-wherever-i-go-you\n\n\nYou dedicated the book to \u201cthe girls of the internet.\u201d For me it feels like the public perception of \u201cfangirl\u201d has shifted a little bit in the last couple of years, like it\u2019s no longer going to be cool or okay for, say, Pitchfork  to write something deriding someone for being a fangirl, but do you think the broader culture is changing? \nI think you\u2019re right, I think on the one hand there\u2019s been a real shift, like Harry Styles in Rolling Stone saying explicitly, (paraphrased), \u201cNo, teenage girls are taste-makers and their taste is really valid.\u201d That is awesome. It\u2019s not revolutionary \u2014 people have said it before \u2014 but it\u2019s getting to be a more explicit stance and fans are demanding it more. On the other hand, I do think there are still a ton of people who think, \u201cYeah, teenage fangirls are dumb and adult women who are still fans in that way are just embarrassing.\u201d \nAs with any cultural shift, it takes a lot of time, and it happens in waves. It sort of doesn\u2019t matter: the same way the culture can tell you \u201cLove yourself! You\u2019re beautiful at any size!\u201d it\u2019ll still [find ways] to tell you \u201cYou\u2019d be more beautiful at a particular size.\u201d People can say \u201cLove your inner weird fan,\u201d but it\u2019s hard and embarrassing to do. Being a woman who\u2019s loud about loving something is never an easy position to be in. \nYou really nailed the style of the Tumblr conspiracy theory post, the way that they\u2019re written, the type of evidence they use, the weird focus on numbers and symbols. How did you research that segment of Tumblr?\nEven before I knew that I was going to write the book, I was so obsessed with the idea of young women being the next frontier of conspiracy theorists, and specifically the way in which the conspiracy theory language actually mimics academic language. It\u2019s very much clear that it\u2019s close-reading. It\u2019s like Harry [Styles] and Louis [Tomlinson] or whatever other celebrity is consciously, purposely presenting themselves as a text. And [girls on Tumblr] are like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s wearing a blue shirt to indicate the color of Louis\u2019 eyes,\u201d as if people can be read like texts and interpreted this way. It\u2019s the opposite of death of the author. Here are these people who are \u201cauthoring\u201d all of their tweets, all of their Instagrams, all of their clothing and packing them full of incredibly complex symbology. \nI feel like I have a pretty decent ear for that stuff. I\u2019m a good mimic. I had taught myself to hear this very specific voice, so getting the opportunity to use it for something and turn it loose was super fun. \n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen Tumblr represented so extensively in a novel. Can you think of any others? \nThere\u2019s a book called Gena/Finn that\u2019s written in emails, and it includes Tumblr. It\u2019s nothing new to write books that use stuff as if it were primary source material, to include letters or text messages or things like that. As for specifically Tumblr and specifically fandom Tumblr, I think this is the most extensive. \nIt seems like a hard question, deciding what elements of the internet to include in a novel. What if it doesn\u2019t make sense to anyone in a couple years? How did you make those choices? \nOriginally I just had Instagram in the book, but then I thought, \u201cOh, I should put Snapchat in here, too.\u201d But now I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, Instagram Stories didn\u2019t exist when I wrote the book, but maybe Snapchat should have been Instagram Stories.\u201d It was a delicate thing, because stuff does change so quickly. But I also feel like that gave me some leeway. It comes to a point where you can\u2019t try to get every little detail right. It was right on this day, the day I got copy edits, and that\u2019s going to have to be good enough. It is fiction. Fever Dream doesn\u2019t exist. In the world where Fever Dream exists, Instagram Stories don\u2019t. \nAnd I made the decision pretty early on: this is going to be a book that\u2019s set right now. In a couple of years people are going to read this book and be like, \u201cOh my god no one\u2019s on Tumblr anymore.\u201d But then, in 10 or 15 years it probably won\u2019t matter. It\u2019ll all sound made up anyway. I felt like I had an opportunity to capture a particular moment really well, because I was so involved in it. \n\u201ci made the decision pretty early on: this is going to be a book that\u2019s set right now.\u201d\nGrace kinds of rides the line between a fan who\u2019s totally immersed and a detached onlooker who\u2019s trying to understand it. Do you think the book is accessible to both types? \nI hope so. When I was writing the book I was sending drafts every day to my friend Logan [Sachon]. I would write 1,000 words and then send it in an email to her, because she was kind of a co-conspirator, we were both down the Larry rabbit hole. I really do think that I wrote it in part as a novel-length attempt to explain to both of us... like, what the hell was going on? Why were we so obsessed with this band, why were we so obsessed with this idea? I wrote it both from a place of very intense, consuming fandom and trying to stand outside of it and ask, \u201cWhat is this? Where did my rational mind go?\u201d \nWe all live in a culture where we\u2019re constantly being bombarded with stories about celebrities, and we are constantly telling ourselves stories about celebrities. The book speaks to that broader activity, and hopefully it will help people contextualize or consider why and how we do that, and what worth it is to us and what worth it is to celebrities, who profit a lot off of taking up free real estate in our brains. \nThe general vibe that I got from the book was pretty positive toward the internet. Do you think this younger cohort has managed to make a better version of it for themselves? \nThe internet was just starting to exist when I was starting to be a teenager, and there was this culture of \u201coh my god, this is terrible, you\u2019re going to meet a predator, or you\u2019re going to get sucked into the screen and never emerge.\u201d Teens, they\u2019ll figure it out. People figure it out. They figure it out differently, and they don\u2019t always figure it out in ways that look right to people who are older than them. I try not to have too much of an opinion about teenagers on the internet, because I don\u2019t think it does teenagers any good. Beyond that, I\u2019ll say that I generally have found it to be a positive force in my life. \nIt can be really fun, but the people you\u2019re talking about are also real people and you really don\u2019t know them. People do really messed-up things in the name of their fandom, and I\u2019m not here to defend those things. The internet can open doors and expose you to a really fantastic community of people. It can be so, so amazing, but it can also put you in an echo chamber, a digital room of people who just agree with you and say \u201cYes! Harry and Louis are sending us messages and they want us to hear them, and we\u2019ve got to get it out there! We\u2019ve got to defend them!\u201d And then all of a sudden you\u2019re sending someone death threats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kevin Winter / Getty Images\n\n\nWe wrote a little bit about Larry theorists back when the Babygate theory was percolating to mainstream awareness. Would you say there was a turning point where the Larry theory went from fun to \u201ctoo far?\u201d\nI think Babygate was a real turning point for a lot of people. That kind of speculation didn\u2019t feel right. Before that I thought, \u201coh, it\u2019s fun and interesting to speculate,\u201d and now I\u2019m like \u201chmm, is it?\u201d For me it no longer is. \nLouis having the baby happened right around the time the band\u2019s contract was up. And a lot of people had sort of been like, \u201coh, as soon as the contract with Modest [Management] ends and they go on hiatus, Louis and Harry will announce that they\u2019re together.\u201d And when that didn\u2019t happen, and the baby happened, there was a real schism where a lot of people who thought it was fun and interesting were like, \u201cHmm, maybe not.\u201d The die-hards doubled down, and I just thought, if Louis fathering a baby isn\u2019t going to convince you... then you\u2019re right, nothing is, and that should scare you.\nAre you at all worried \u2014 I\u2019m asking because I\u2019ve been on the wrong side of a passionate fandom before \u2014 about Larry theorists\u2019 reactions? \nYeah, I am. I haven\u2019t gotten any blowback for it yet, which is not to say it won\u2019t happen. I have a good friend who just got on the wrong side of Larry fandom, which is wild because she is a Larry. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen. It seems extremely unpleasant.\nThis is what I will say: I\u2019m less concerned about getting harassed by the Larry fandom for writing about One Direction than I am about being harassed by Nazis for writing about being Jewish, which I also do. Not to say that it\u2019s not scary, but I\u2019m a woman who writes on the internet. I\u2019ve been worrying about my safety as long as I\u2019ve been doing it. Here\u2019s another dimension to it, but probably they won\u2019t actually kill me. Who knows. \nThere\u2019s a lot of focus in the book on tattoos. They\u2019re involved in the conspiracy theory, and Grace also just admires them on the boys in the band and then gets one herself. I\u2019m curious what that symbol means to you. \nTattoos are so interesting as a way of claiming and decorating your own body. One of the reasons I think boy bands are so fascinating is because there are ways in which they are asked to act \u2014 there are standards of behavior imposed on them in the same way that they\u2019re imposed on young women. \n\u201cthere are standards of behavior imposed on [boy bands] in the same way that they\u2019re imposed on young women.\u201d\nThey need to be attractive, but they\u2019re never really allowed to have sex. They should be friendly and make everyone love them and be available, the same way that young women are asked to be available every time they\u2019re in public. I\u2019m really fascinated by boy bands members, by what they claim for themselves. When they say, \u201cNo, there are parts of me that aren\u2019t for the public, there are parts of me that are just mine. I can get as many tattoos as I want, I don\u2019t have to tell you what they are or what they mean.\u201d \nThat translates really beautifully into thinking about young women\u2019s relationships with their bodies: the way they say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you like it, I don\u2019t care if you think this is feminine or attractive, I want my body to look this way.\u201d Not only that, but \u201cI think my body would look more beautiful this way, and I think I deserve to have a body that looks beautiful by my definition of that word.\u201d I think it\u2019s a really potent way of claiming space for yourself. \nDid you read Mitski\u2019s review of the Harry Styles album? \nI did. \nTo me, it got at one of the major things in the book. The idea that girls have these fantasies around the boys in these bands, and the fantasies are often at odds with the truth of those boys\u2019 humanity. But at the same time, it feels almost unfair that people have picked now to say that that\u2019s wrong. Women have existed as fantasy in pop and rock music forever, and now that the script is flipped, suddenly everyone wants to say \u201cdon\u2019t make stuff up about these people, they\u2019re real people.\u201d \nIn general, I think that people are very, very eager to pathologize women having fantasy lives. Men are just allowed to have them. When women do, it\u2019s only because \u201cboy bands are harmless, and these are men that girls don\u2019t have to interact with emotionally,\u201d and all this fucking shit. Jesus, you know, celebrities are hot and they\u2019re rich. Part of it is just that. That\u2019s it. We\u2019re just attracted to them. Everyone has a fantasy life, and obviously I\u2019m engaged in questioning it and thinking critically about it, but framing it as pathological is just ridiculous. \nAs it happened, Harry\u2019s album came out on the same day as Jill Soloway\u2019s adaptation of I Love Dick. I Love Dick is all about a woman using a man as her muse and how the man freaks out. There\u2019s a scene in it where the woman\u2019s husband and her muse, played by Kevin Bacon, are having a conversation and the husband asks Kevin Bacon, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d And Kevin Bacon says, \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d I was like, exactly! It\u2019s embarrassing, and it\u2019s also embarrassing to have someone say, \u201cI noticed you and I put you in my song without asking.\u201d Harry wrote this song \u201cCarolina\u201d about a girl he met one time and everyone was saying, \u201cOh my god, what a dream, what a fantasy!\u201d And I was like well, he fantasized about her, he used her in his song, now she\u2019s at the center of attention whether she wants to be or not. \nSo, all the pop culture and internet culture stuff aside, this is a coming-of-age novel about first love, friends growing apart, and leaving high school. What do you think makes love of a boy band, or love of an internet community, so perfect for that moment in a life? \nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with loving a boy band and fantasizing about them, but there is an point where you need to recognize \u2014 about boy bands, about men in general, about people in general \u2014 \u201cOkay, I have my fantasies about people, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but I need to remember that they\u2019re just fantasies. They\u2019re not going to dictate or determine that person\u2019s behavior. And clinging to my fantasies can allow me to hurt other people and can allow other people to hurt me.\u201d \nThe same way a lot of coming-of-age stories feature moments in which teenagers realize their parents are not heroes or villains, they\u2019re just people. It\u2019s like, yeah... and also boy bands. \n\u201cthe question of coming-of-age is the enormous question of \u2018how can you be yourself?\u2019\u201d\nIn terms of the internet, it\u2019s so possible to be a selective version of yourself on the internet, and that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s important to recognize and come to grips with who you want to be and how willing you are to stand up for that \u2014 to be a little weird in order to be more true to yourself. In Grace\u2019s case, the part of herself that she\u2019s happiest with is the person she is when she\u2019s online. So the question for her is how does she bring that emotional authenticity out into her life. \nThe question of coming-of-age is the enormous question of \u201chow can you be yourself?\u201d So really anything, almost anything relates to that. How do you be yourself is such a huge question, everything is involved in it. \nGrace and the Fever is available now from Penguin Random House. \n"}
