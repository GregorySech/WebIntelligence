{"title": "A glittery phone case is a solid choice if you want to look spunky and young", "content": " \nWeird Phone Case of the Month is a monthly series in which we live with, and subsequently review, our time with a phone case. Phone cases are one of our only ways to express individuality with our smartphones, so what do our phone case choices say about us?\nI first bought a green glittery phone case. Then a purple one. I\u2019m sticking with the purple. When I made the switch from Samsung to Apple, part of my reasoning hinged on the fact that iPhones often have better case choices than Android devices. I wanted more phone case options, so there you go. When I got my iPhone, I initially picked out a cerulean gemstone-covered case. It shimmered whenever it caught the light and was over-the-top in every way. Eventually the gems got crusty and lost their luster, so I began hunting for the next best case.\nI happened upon my green glitter-filled phone case in Flushing, New York. It was a magical moment. I had wandered into a random electronics store, and while I mainly was taken by all the trinkets they had lying around, I also looked at their cases of cases. They kept my green glitter guy under the glass. \nThe case is filled with water and has glitter and reflective confetti that falls whichever way the phone tilts. My purple one, which I got in LA along with my furry case, is essentially the same, except it\u2019s more of a gel than a plastic. The gel is infinitely preferable because it feels nicer in my hand and is also easier to take off, although I\u2019m not taking this case off very often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlitter phone cases, as I\u2019ve learned, look great at first. Who doesn\u2019t love some sparkle? But after weeks of use, well, you\u2019re probably going to get an air bubble. Those air bubbles are bad. I haven\u2019t figure out a solution for getting rid of them, either. I wish I could help!\nAs far as its uses, this case is by far the handiest distraction. My commute to work is over an hour (pity me, please), and I often find myself playing with the case while listening to a podcast or music. The glitter falling back and forth while I bob along on the subway is calming. I recommend trying this if you buy a glitter phone case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, glittery phone cases seem to always catch my friends\u2019 eyes. People comment on it almost immediately after seeing it, and everyone wants to play with it, too. I\u2019ve found that lots of my friends are getting these cases now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to me having one, but more like Urban Outfitters is carrying them. A glitter phone case communicates to the world that you\u2019re fun, spunky, and enjoy a shiny distraction once in a while. There\u2019s no shame in that. \n"}
