{"title": "Google can now recognize objects in videos using machine learning", "content": " \nFei-Fei Li, chief scientist of artificial intelligence and machine learning at Google Cloud, came on stage at Google\u2019s Next Cloud conference today to talk about the current and next-generation applications of AI that Google\u2019s working on. These technologies will make a difference in self-driving cars and healthcare, sure, but also Snapchat\u2019s filters and Google Photos\u2019 search capabilities. But the big highlight came when she announced a new way to allow software to parse video.\nThis new \u201cVideo Intelligence API\u201d was demoed onstage, and it offered the kind of \u201cwhoa\u201d moment you expect from a Google keynote. By playing a short commercial, the API was able to identify the dachshund in the video, when it appeared in the video, and then understand that the whole thing was a commercial. In another demo, we saw a simple search for \u201cbeach\u201d and was able to find videos which had scenes from beaches in them, complete with timestamps. That\u2019s similar to how Google Photos lets you search for \u201csunset\u201d and pull up your best late-day snapshots. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore now, computers couldn\u2019t really understand the content of a video directly without manual tagging. \u201cWe are beginning to shine light on the dark matter of the digital universe,\u201d Li said. At least in Google\u2019s demo, it was genuinely impressive. And Google is making the API available to developers, just as it has with its other machine learning APIs.\nThe demo came near the end of a long keynote about Google\u2019s attempt to convince everybody that it\u2019s a serious player in the cloud services game. To signal its investment in this business, Google brought out the big guns: SVP of Google Cloud Diane Greene spoke, of course, alongside CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman Eric Schmidt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to shine light on the dark matter of the digital universe.\u201d\nThe keynote today wasn\u2019t exactly a barn burner. It\u2019s apparently impossible for anybody to talk about cloud services and machine learning without resorting to vague platitudes. Even if this isn\u2019t an event meant for consumers, it was remarkably light on specifics about Google\u2019s services. Verizon, HSBC, eBay, Home Depot, Disney, Colgate-Palmolive, and SAP also spoke about their partnerships with Google \u2014 alternately in glittering generalities and arcane enterprise software acronyms.\nThe big question is whether Google\u2019s splashy attempt to make the case that it can play on equal terms with Amazon and Microsoft will move the needle at all. As The Wall Street Journal notes, Google is significantly behind those two competitors, even though its technology is competitive. Basically, the companies Google needs to woo are all already engaged in longstanding partnerships with another cloud provider. As Dave Bartoletti, principal analyst at Forrester Research, told the Journal: \u201cThey\u2019re not invited to the party enough.\u201d \nBut if Google can find practical applications for whiz-bang features like the Video API demo it showed today, it might find itself allowed into the next soir\u00e9e.\n"}
