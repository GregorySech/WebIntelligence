{"title": "Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge is still a great phone, and now great value thanks to the S8", "content": " \nIn anticipation of Samsung\u2019s shiny new Galaxy S8, I\u2019ve gone back to using the smartphone it is replacing, the Galaxy S7 Edge, and what I\u2019ve (re)discovered is a device still very much worthy of the flagship title. A year after its release, the S7 Edge remains one of the very best smartphones you can buy, and that\u2019s only going to get better once its price gets dinged by the S8\u2019s arrival this month.\nI really didn\u2019t set out to re-review the S7 Edge; all I wanted was to remind myself what Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz interface was like, so as to be able to best judge the company\u2019s changes in the 2017 iteration. But then I started admiring the S7 Edge\u2019s screen. And I got an appreciation for the battery life that comes from a class-leading 3,600mAh battery. By the time I\u2019d taken a few decent photos with the camera, I was convinced sufficiently to swap my SIM card over from my beloved Pixel and extend this Samsung test drive.\nNow, am I saying the S7 Edge is better than the Pixel? Or better than the upcoming Galaxy S8? Definitely not. But depending on how its price shakes out in your local market, the S7 Edge looks set to offer much better value for money. Think about the things you want from a premium smartphone: a universally high standard of quality across display, camera, ergonomics, and looks, with the biggest possible battery that doesn\u2019t explode. Well, the S7 Edge checks off all those boxes in 2017 almost as well as it did in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\nI\u2019d have preferred if Samsung had moved to a USB-C connector with its S7 family, but I worked around my hate for Micro USB by just using an Anker wireless charger with a USB-C port. Besides that small annoyance (which for most people is actually an advantage as it keeps compatibility with all the chargers they already have), the only other thing that could trouble a potential S7 Edge owner are the titular edges of the screen. It took me a while to adapt to them and stop accidentally activating on-screen items with my palm, but I got there.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nSamsung Galaxy S7 review: on the edge of perfection\nPictures don\u2019t do the Galaxy S8 justice\n\nAside from Google\u2019s pair of Pixel phones (which are awfully hard to buy even today) and Samsung\u2019s own upcoming upgrade in the shape of the S8, I\u2019d rank the S7 Edge ahead of all its Android competitors. That\u2019s in spite of LG launching its new top-tier G6 phone this spring, which looks nice (and, in one variant, sounds terrific) but is weighed down by LG\u2019s awful software. And in spite of HTC swinging and missing with the U Ultra, and Sony promising to have a new premium phone at some point before the end of the world. More to the point, the iPhone 7\u2019s arrival last September has done practically nothing to alter the Galaxy S7\u2019s competitive position: the iPhone 6S was a good phone with a good camera, and so was the iPhone 7.\nWe usually complain about the plateauing of smartphone improvements, which are now coming at a slower pace and in more incremental ways \u2014 but the upside of that deceleration is that you can pick up yesteryear\u2019s flagship phone and still feel like you\u2019re riding in the premium smartphone carriage. And that\u2019s nice.\n"}
