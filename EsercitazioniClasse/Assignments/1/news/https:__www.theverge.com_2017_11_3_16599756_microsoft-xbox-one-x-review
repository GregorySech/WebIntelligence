{"title": "Xbox One X review", "content": " The first time I powered up the Xbox One X, I genuinely thought my house was falling down. Microsoft\u2019s boot-up animation is bright, loud, and full of surround sound bass, perfectly epitomizing the bombastic nature of the company\u2019s \u201ctrue 4K\u201d gaming message. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One X is the world\u2019s most powerful console, and the company is beating its chest about its 4K capabilities. Microsoft has a lot of reasons it needs to be this bold. Sony is winning this console war, backed by massive exclusive titles like The Last of Us, Uncharted 4, and Horizon Zero Dawn. The original Xbox One had a hard time competing with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4, thanks initially to lower specifications and a bundled Kinect that led to a $100 price gap. Microsoft is answering those old complaints with the new Xbox One X. It\u2019s a smaller, sleeker, faster console than the original, and it\u2019s easily more capable than the PS4 or PS4 Pro  Sony\u2019s 4K console  in terms of raw power.While the power inside is unquestionable, Microsoft\u2019s focus on hardware specs isn\u2019t matched with launch titles that really show off 4K gaming. Forza Motorsport 7 debuted last month, so the Xbox One X isn\u2019t launching with any exclusive AAA games. At $499, you\u2019re really paying for the pure hardware here, and you\u2019ll need a 4K TV to get the best benefits. If you\u2019re an original Xbox One owner, you\u2019re going to be really pleased with the improvements. For everyone else, it\u2019s going to depend on what games you play. Hardware only goes so far.  The hardwareLet\u2019s start with the basics. I\u2019m really impressed and surprised at how much power Microsoft has managed to squeeze into the Xbox One X\u2019s small case. While the original Xbox One was a big, black box about the size of an old-school VCR, the Xbox One X matches the impressive design of the Xbox One S. It\u2019s actually smaller than the S in terms of volume, but I did notice if you stack them, then the X is larger in some dimensions. Either way, it\u2019s small enough to fit in a backpack, but it\u2019s rather dense so it feels heavier than the One S.The Xbox One X design is very similar to the SThe Xbox One X has the same inputs and ports as the S. There\u2019s HDMI-in if you want to connect up a TV set-top box, two USBs at the rear and one at the front, and an Ethernet port. Microsoft ditched the external power supply from the original Xbox One, and it\u2019s all integrated in and dual voltage. All in all, it\u2019s very similar to the Xbox One S from the outside and still needs a USB adaptor for the Kinect.The real power can be found inside. Microsoft is using a 2.3GHz 8-core AMD Jaguar processor, 12GB of RAM, and a six-teraflop AMD Radeon GPU. That\u2019s nearly two teraflops more than the PS4 Pro, a faster CPU, and 3GB more of overall RAM. The Xbox One X comfortably outperforms the PS4 Pro. On hardware alone, it\u2019s smaller, more powerful, and even includes a 4K Blu-ray player over its PS4 Pro rival.All of that power means you need a good cooling system and fans to match. During my own testing, I haven\u2019t noticed any huge issues here. The fans are noticeable  like a gaming PC  at times when you\u2019re not even pushing the console, and they\u2019re definitely louder than the Xbox One S. The back of the One X unit does get rather hot, and I\u2019d recommend not keeping this locked away in a cupboard. I never had issues with it stacked inside an open shelving unit, though. 4K gamingThe real promise of the Xbox One X is \u201ctrue 4K\u201d gaming. Most games made for the Xbox One are designed for 1080p TVs, which have a quarter of the pixels found on a new 4K TV. The Xbox One X is more than four times faster than the original Xbox One, so it\u2019s capable of 4K gaming. While it\u2019s not as powerful as the latest gaming PCs, the benefits are really going to depend on what game you\u2019re playing. Microsoft is promising more than 150 \u201cenhanced\u201d games for the Xbox One X, but that doesn\u2019t always mean they will be 4K. Some enhancements could include better frame rates instead of 4K resolution, or HDR capability. Other enhancements might include 4K, HDR, and better frame rates. It\u2019s up to game developers to decide, and there\u2019s not a clear pattern yet.I enjoy PC games for the smooth frame rates, and I find it nauseating jumping back to the same game running at 30fps on a console. I spent some time playing Gears of War 4 with its new up-to-60fps \u201cperformance mode.\u201d Although it\u2019s an old game at this point, it\u2019s a good example of how the Xbox One X can have 4K modes or performance-focused modes. The 4K mode, coupled with HDR, looks great, but the performance mode running at 60fps feels even better without the 4K resolution boost. Rise of the Tomb Raider also has similar options, and it\u2019s a balance that game developers should really offer gamers.Some games will offer 4K, HDR, and 60fpsSome games like Forza Motorsport 7 will offer the best of all worlds: 4K, HDR, and 60fps. This is the peak of what the Xbox One X offers, but Microsoft didn\u2019t make the Forza 7 update available in time for review. I\u2019ve played demo versions over the past few weeks at Xbox events and it looks beautiful, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to really notice the difference over what I have with my Xbox One S. The S runs Forza 7 at 60fps with HDR, so you'd have to really care about the resolution upgrade and the better textures and shadows.Other titles like Titanfall 2 also boost the resolution up to 4K, but dynamically alter it based on GPU load to keep smooth gameplay at 60fps. I could argue about all the various tricks that developers will use to hit 4K gaming, whether it\u2019s checkerboarding or dynamic resolution, but none of this really matters unless you\u2019re a pixel nerd. It\u2019s the gameplay that matters, and once you\u2019ve tried a game in 60fps it\u2019s hard to step back to 30fps, regardless of the resolution and textures.One of the biggest improvements I noticed when an Enhanced for Xbox One X update arrived was Assassin's Creed Origins. It looks stunning on the Xbox One X, with a 4K resolution and HDR support. It\u2019s way less blurry than on my Xbox One S, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s closer to looking like it does on my PC thanks to the obvious improvements in textures. On my LG OLED with HDR enabled it looks gorgeous and runs really well. I hope this is a shining example of what\u2019s to come from developers on newer games. Not all enhancements are available just yetIt\u2019s a mixture right now, and not all developers have made their enhancements available to test. I spent the beginning of the week playing Super Lucky\u2019s Tale \u2013  a 3D platformer originally released in VR for the Oculus Rift \u2013  as no other games I owned had updates ready. It\u2019s a good looking game, but it doesn\u2019t really push what the Xbox One X can do.You don\u2019t necessarily need a 4K TV to get some of the console\u2019s benefits. If you happen to have a 1440p gaming monitor laying around then the Xbox One X will soon support it. I wasn\u2019t able to test this as Microsoft isn\u2019t supporting 1440p just yet, but it won\u2019t just be outputting like the PS4 Pro at 1080p and upscaling. Likewise, 1080p TVs will see benefits to pure performance. I played Destiny 2 on the Xbox One X and it felt a lot smoother than on my Xbox One S. It\u2019s still locked to 30fps, but some of the frame rate dips I\u2019d experienced during Destiny\u2019s raid or public events were gone. Some games without One X-specific updates, like Destiny 2 at this point, will still see performance improvements and better texture filtering on the One X. My biggest issue with the Xbox One X is a lack of stunning 4K games to really show why this is worth $499. Assassin's Creed Origins is the best I tried, but it\u2019s not exclusive to the Xbox One X. Microsoft doesn\u2019t have a single launch exclusive for this console, and while enhancements to old games are great, I often found it hard to even notice big differences because I don\u2019t think some of these games were designed with 4K textures in mind. There\u2019s no big blockbuster game I can only play on the Xbox One X right now, and Microsoft isn\u2019t offering up much hope for the future, either.Crackdown 3 was supposed to launch in time for the Xbox One X, but it\u2019s delayed until spring next year. Scalebound, Fable Legends, and Ion were outright canceled, and Microsoft has shut down Project Spark. Even PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, Microsoft\u2019s \u201cconsole launch exclusive,\u201d won\u2019t be available until December 12th.Sony has God of War, Spider-Man, Death Stranding, The Last of Us Part II, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Detroit all on the way. Whether these are all native 4K or not, these are huge games and they make Microsoft\u2019s lineup look paltry by comparison. EntertainmentAside from games, the Xbox One X is also an entertainment center of sorts. The 4K Blu-ray drive will bring you crisp movies with Dolby Atmos and HDR 10  but no Dolby Vision  support, and it\u2019s an addition the PS4 Pro lacks. Oddly, Microsoft doesn\u2019t offer 4K movies or TV shows in its own store outside the US. You\u2019ll need to mostly rely on a Netflix or Amazon Video subscription to get streaming 4K movies or TV shows, and even the YouTube app doesn\u2019t support 4K. It\u2019s an odd omission given Microsoft\u2019s 4K focus.Microsoft has a great range of entertainment appsMicrosoft does have some good third-party apps for entertainment, including Plex, Spotify, Amazon Video, Netflix, HBO Go, and Hulu Plus. You can also use the HDMI-in port to connect up a Chromecast, or watch TV through your cable set-top box with the Xbox\u2019s OneGuide. Microsoft has stepped back from some of its entertainment and TV commitments, but the Xbox One X is still a solid box to watch content alongside playing games.One thing to note: buy an external drive for the Xbox One X. I ran out of space on the 1TB drive of the Xbox One X with around 14 games installed and 20 apps. Most Xbox One games are around 40GB or 50GB in size, but I\u2019ve noticed the Enhanced for Xbox One X games are significantly bigger. Gears of War 4 and Halo 5 are at least 100GB, and Titanfall 2 is around 70GB. If you don\u2019t have a particularly fast internet connection you\u2019ll also be waiting hours to download these games. I\u2019ve not had enough time to test all of the enhancements to the Xbox One X games, simply because they haven\u2019t gone live at the time of this review. That said, the ones I\u2019ve experienced haven\u2019t blown me away enough to warrant the upgrade over my Xbox One S. I switched back to the One S, and I did notice that certain games weren\u2019t as smooth and certainly didn\u2019t look as good, but I soon adjusted.Likewise, when I returned to the Xbox One X it felt a lot like my Xbox One S. The jump from 1080p to 4K isn\u2019t as profound as SD to HD, and I found it hard to always notice the difference at the distance from my TV. Maybe that will change once more enhanced games are available, but I don\u2019t think most people will be able to notice a big difference just yet. Games will need to be tweaked and fully optimized for the Xbox One X hardware, and you already get the benefits of HDR on the Xbox One S. That said, the X does offer the best graphics currently possible on a console. If you don\u2019t care about Sony\u2019s exclusives then the Xbox One X will be the best console to play all the cross-platform games coming out. If you already have a large stack of Xbox One games and you\u2019re using the original console, this is going to be a nice upgrade if you own a 4K TV.For anyone else, this probably isn\u2019t the console for you. Sony really has some impressive exclusives on the way, and it\u2019s hard for Microsoft to counter this despite its great job on the hardware. Microsoft promised the best hardware, and it delivered \u2014 but that\u2019s nothing without games.8.5Verge ScoreMicrosoft Xbox One XGood StuffA lot of games will get a power boost, with support for Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One titles4K Blu-ray driveSmall and well-designed hardwareBad StuffYou need external storage, 1TB isn\u2019t enoughNot enough exclusive 4K-enhanced gamesThe One S offers HDR and 4K Blu-ray support for less moneyBuy for $499.99 from AmazonBuy for $499.00 from Microsoft Buy for $499.99 from GameStop"}
