{"title": "Soundwall\u2019s touch-controlled artwork doubles as a speaker", "content": " \nToday, Soundwall is updating its line of speaker artwork \u2014 spartwork, if you will \u2014 with the launch of its new Nova line. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Soundwall, the idea is that you can pick out a piece of art or upload your own, and Soundwall will ship you an aluminum piece that not only looks nice but also functions as a speaker. Yes, you read that right. The Soundwall is made of aluminum, and the art is transferred onto it using a process called dye sublimation. Two things for the price of one! What a deal! Except that a Soundwall piece starts at $900, so while it might be a deal, it\u2019s an expensive one.\nThe new Nova line includes a touch bar to control the speaker \u2014 you can play, pause, or skip songs \u2014 as well as mood lighting in a range of colors that can be customized. There\u2019s also a presence sensor on the bottom of the frame that can detect motion to activate the lights. Soundwall connects over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and has to be plugged into the wall for power. \nNow, I can\u2019t speak to the sound quality or the subjective art quality of Soundwall, but I can say that there are other art displays already on the market. Granted, those art displays don\u2019t double as a speaker but they at least offer the option of changing artwork. Soundwall might be a more enticing if I could rotate my artwork continuously, like on the EO2. What if you get sick of your floating astronaut?\n"}
