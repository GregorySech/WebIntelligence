{"content": " Apple just released iOS 11.1, the first major update to iOS 11 since its release in September. Included in the changes are over 70 new emoji, along with some other minor updates, like the return of the 3D Touch option to open up the app switcher by pressing down on the left side of the screen that Apple mystifyingly took out in the original iOS 11 release. iOS 11.1 also features a patch for the \u201cKrack\u201d Wi-Fi hack vulnerability, which is good news and a reason to make sure that you\u2019re updated on your devices, even if you aren\u2019t particularly excited by the idea of a broccoli emoji. And of course, there\u2019s the usual \u201cbug fixes and Improvements,\u201d which should hopefully make iOS 11 a little more stable.iOS 11.1 is available to download now on supported iPhones and iPads.
