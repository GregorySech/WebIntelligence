{"title": "Best practices for passwords updated after original author regrets his advice", "content": " \nA vast majority of the trusted tips and tricks we employ when crafting a custom password actually make us more vulnerable to hackers, according to the expert who popularized the tips back in 2003. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, former National Institute of Standards and Technology manager Bill Burr admitted that a document he authored on crafting strong passwords was misguided. \u201cMuch of what I did I now regret,\u201d says Burr, who is 72 years old and now retired. \nBurr\u2019s password advice pushed users toward lazy and easy-to-predict practices\nThe problem wasn\u2019t that Burr was advising people to make passwords that are inherently easy to crack, but that his advice steered everyday computer users toward lazy mistakes and easy-to-predict practices. Burr\u2019s eight-page password document, titled \u201cNIST Special Publication 800-63. Appendix A,\u201d advised people to use irregular capitalization, special characters, and at least one numeral. That might result in a password like \u201cP@ssW0rd123!\u201d While that may make it seem secure on the surface (neglecting, of course, that \u201cpassword\u201d is a bad password), the issue is that most people tend to use the same exact techniques when crafting these digital combo locks. That results in strings of characters and numbers that hackers could easily predict and algorithms that specifically target those weaknesses. \nEven worse, Burr suggested people should change passwords regularly, at least every 90 days. This advice, which was then adopted by academic institutions, government bodies, and large corporations, pushed users to make easy-to-crack passwords. Most people can probably point to a password they\u2019ve created that was deemed strong simply because it had a special character like the \u201c!\u201d or \u201c?\u201d symbol and a numeric string like \u201c123.\u201d And when prompted to change a password, who hasn\u2019t altered it only slightly to avoid the hassle of coming up with an all-new code? \nA popular xkcd comic from cartoonist Randall Munroe, published back in August 2011, poked a hole in this common logic by pointing out how the password \u201cTr0ub4dor&3\u201d could be cracked in about three days with standard techniques, due to its predictable capitalization, numeric substitutions, and special character use. The password \u201ccorrect horse battery staple,\u201d written as a single phrase, would take 550 years. (Security experts have confirmed Munroe\u2019s math, according to the WSJ.) \u201cThrough 20 years of effort, we have correctly trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess,\u201d Munroe wrote at the bottom.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: xkcd\n\n\nIn other words, the passwords you should be using are obscure, almost unexplainable phrases full of human randomness that make them easy to commit to memory and yet almost impossible for an automated system to make sense of. Of course, for those who use password managers like LastPass, you can generate cryptographically secure passwords on the fly. But it\u2019s still important to have a hard-to-crack master password. \n\u201cIn the end, it was probably too complicated for a lot of folks to understand very well, and the truth is, it was barking up the wrong tree,\u201d Burr admits of his advice. The new NIST standards that were published in June, authored by technical advisor Paul Grassi, did away with much of Burr\u2019s advice. \n\u201cWe ended up starting from scratch,\u201d Grassi tells the WSJ. But Burr might be exaggerating the negative effects of his password advice, Grassi adds: \u201cHe wrote a security document that held up for 10 to 15 years. I only hope to be able to have a document hold up that long.\u201d \n"}
