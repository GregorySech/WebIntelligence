{"title": "Lenovo\u2019s new Yoga 920 laptop has far-field microphones so you can shout at Cortana", "content": " \nMicrosoft\u2019s virtual assistant Cortana has been in Windows 10 laptops for a couple of years now, usually accessible via the search box on the Windows desktop and, in some cases, via a dedicated physical button. Lenovo is taking that a step further by turning its top-of-the-line Yoga laptop into what is, essentially, a home assistant. \nThe new Lenovo Yoga 920, announced today at the IFA trade show in Berlin, has far-field microphones so users can talk to the laptop from more than a dozen feet away and Cortana will respond \u2014 even if the laptop is closed. This means you can shout at your laptop to take notes or set calendar appointments even if you\u2019re not at the laptop. If last year\u2019s big Windows push at IFA was all about pen support, this year might be the year of voice control; the newly-announced Yoga 720 laptop, a smaller model, also has this capability. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo\n\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the pen is taking a backset. The Lenovo Yoga 920 also works with an optional Lenovo Active Pen 2, which the previous laptop model, the Yoga 910, didn\u2019t support. Lenovo says this second version of the Active Pen is more sensitive than the first version, with \u201cno discernible lag.\u201d \nThe new Yoga 920 also has Intel\u2019s latest 8th generation quad core i7 processor (Kaby Lake refresh), 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. And it has twin Thunderbolt 3 ports, something that The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn knocked the Yoga 910 for not having in his review of that machine. The Yoga 920 has a fingerprint reader for authentication, but still no Windows Hello facial recognition through the laptop\u2019s camera. \nOtherwise, the all-metal, 13.9-inch Yoga 920 either maintains or improves slightly upon the pre-existing Lenovo Yoga devices, which are known for their ability to be converted from a traditional laptop into a tablet or \u201ctent-mode\u201d display. It has the same watchband hinge that lets it fold into different form factors. It a 4K touchscreen display that Lenovo describes as nearly bezel-less, but it does still have that massive bezel on the bottom portion of the display. \nIt weighs just about the same as the previous model, 3.02 pounds compared to the Yoga 910\u2019s 3.04 pounds. One new, tiny, appreciated design change is that the front edge of the laptop has a lip carved out, so you can more easily pry the laptop open. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenovo\n\n\nSince this is Lenovo\u2019s top of the line Yoga model, it\u2019s not cheap: it has a starting price in the US of $1329.99, and is expected to ship for the holidays. It\u2019s also coming in a couple new colors, copper and bronze, in addition to silver platinum. And Lenovo is rolling out a few limited edition, Star Wars-themed Gorilla Glass cover designs. Which is cool. But we just can\u2019t wait to get our hands on it so we can start trying out its far-field microphones.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n"}
