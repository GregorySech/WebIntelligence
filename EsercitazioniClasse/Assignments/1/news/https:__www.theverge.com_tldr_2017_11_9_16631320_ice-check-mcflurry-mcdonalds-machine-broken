{"content": " \nI have a new woman to look up to in tech, and her name is Raina McLeod. Raina made an iPhone app called Ice Check that directs you to the nearest working McFlurry machine at a McDonald\u2019s. Raina is a goddess. \nI am personally invested in this app because even though I don\u2019t frequently eat at McDonald\u2019s, when I do go, I really, really want McDonald\u2019s. This is because it\u2019s likely past 3AM, I\u2019ve had a few shots of Jameson, and the idea of some amalgamation of salt, fat, sugar, and carbs turns me into a Big Mac homing device. When I\u2019m in this position and placing my order, there are two sentences a McDonald\u2019s employee can say that will turn my heart into a raisin: \u201cSorry, we\u2019re serving breakfast now,\u201d and \u201cSorry, our McFlurry machine is down.\u201d\nYou have probably heard of the Legend of the Broken Ice Cream Machine. Based on my own scientific research, which consists of many visits to various McDonald\u2019s across the United States after drinking alcohol, I personally believe that McFlurry machines are broken more than they\u2019re working.\nI know I\u2019m not alone in my feelings because A) I typed \u201cMcDonald\u2019s ice cream\u201d into Google and it wanted to autofill in \u201cmachine meme\u201d and B) the Wall Street Journal actually spent the time and money to investigate why McDonald\u2019s ice cream machines are down all the time. The short answer is that it takes four hours to clean them every day. And, getting it ready for this cleaning takes 11 steps. It\u2019s so complicated the article says: \u201cif someone ordered an ice cream while employees were in the process of cleaning the machines, they often just said it was down rather than reassembling it.\u201d On top of McFlurry-related sadness, I now have McFlurry-related trust issues.\n\n\nWhen the ice cream machine not working at mcdonalds so u cant get a mcflurry pic.twitter.com/u0G94oMn7H\u2014 Slump Sylar (@YUNGRAJEE) March 3, 2014\n\n\n\nSo, back to my new hero. Raina tells Buzzfeed, \u201cI came up with the idea for the app around a year ago, after a late night Oreo McFlurry craving went unfulfilled due to the ice cream machine being down.\u201d This automatically makes Raina a better person than me, as my normal response in this situation is to go home with a No. 1 and grumble my feelings into french fries, which I now can\u2019t dunk into a McFlurry, but have ordered anyway.\nThe app works via GPS and input from users. You can locate a McDonald\u2019s and it will then tell you if the machine is in service, based upon crowdsourced reports. It is truly amazing what humans can accomplish by pooling resources. Of course, this also means that the app might not be entirely accurate if there aren\u2019t enough people reporting on the status of these machines. There is also an option for franchise owners to claim their location so they can update the status of their store\u2019s machine, but it\u2019s unclear if any of them have signed up to do this (or if they ever will). \nRaina views her app as activism, which is not wrong. \"Why should this big company not give us what we want when we want it?\" she said in an interview with DC Inno. \"I don\u2019t want us to have to work, but they\u2019re not telling us. I feel like an activist \u2014 and that\u2019s a weird thing to say. I really do think that people should have what they want.\"\nAs of now, Ice Check is only available for iOS. My advice is to download the app so you can contribute to The Cause and know you made a difference in someone\u2019s day. Godspeed, Raina McLeod, newly anointed patron saint of McFlurries. Godspeed.\n", "title": "This app tells you if your local McDonald\u2019s ice cream machine is down"}
