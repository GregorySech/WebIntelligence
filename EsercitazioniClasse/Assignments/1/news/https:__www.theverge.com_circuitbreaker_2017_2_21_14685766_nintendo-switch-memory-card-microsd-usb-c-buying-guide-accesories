{"title": "Four things you should get for your Nintendo Switch before it arrives", "content": " \nWe\u2019re quickly approaching the March 3rd launch of the Nintendo Switch. While you (hopefully) have your console\u2019s preorder locked, there are a few other things you might want to grab for your Switch in advance.\nBelow, we\u2019ve broken down our picks for microSD cards, Ethernet adapters, charging cables, and everything else we can think of that you might want on hand when your Switch arrives.\nmicroSD cards\nThe Nintendo Switch can theoretically take use microSD cards up to 2TB (although 256GB cards are the largest size currently on the market). When choosing your storage, remember that microSD cards aren\u2019t created equal, and there\u2019s a lot more to their specs than pure storage capacity. \n\nUse what you have:\n\nObviously, the best memory card for your Switch is probably the one you already have at home. The Switch is compatible with SDXC cards, which is backwards compatible with the older, smaller capacity SD and SDHC cards. So pretty much any microSD card you\u2019ve got lying around from an old Android phone or a digital camera should work in the Switch. You\u2019ll have to format and erase the contents of the card before using it, so back up anything you\u2019d like to keep first.\nOr buy new:\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a new card specifically for the Switch, we have some recommendations for that, too. Now, Nintendo hasn\u2019t released the exact specifications for the Switch\u2019s SD card support beyond the 2TB and SDXC details. That said, the company is licensing accessory maker Hori to make bespoke Nintendo Switch-branded cards, so we\u2019ll use those specifications, for the time being, as our guideline as to what class of microSD card to look for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hori card is a smaller microSDHC card, storage-wise, but we care about the speeds: it\u2019s a UHS-I slot (denoted by the Roman numeral I) with a Class 10 speed class (the 10 in the circle) and Class 1 UHS Speed Class (the 1 in the u-shaped bucket). We\u2019ve contacted Nintendo for more details, but until we hear otherwise, we\u2019ll be focusing on cards with roughly those parameters. \n(There is the possibility the Switch can use other microSD cards. For example, a Class 1 UHS promises a minimum speed of 10MB/s. But a Class 3 card promises a minimum speed of 30MB/s. Again, the Switch can use these higher class cards, but it\u2019s unclear if the hardware will take advantage of the higher speeds in any fashion.)\nBest Value: For a 64GB card, it\u2019s hard to beat Lexar\u2019s 300x model, which costs $20. However, the 300x has a 45MB/s top speed, almost half that of the $25 PNY Elite (up to 85 MB/s read speed), the $30 Samsung Evo+ (up to 80MB/s), or the $30 SanDisk Extreme (up to 90MB/s read speed), all of which are good options, too. \nBest Storage: We don\u2019t know how big the average Switch game is, but as a benchmark, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is apparently a 13.4GB download (or almost half the Switch\u2019s 32GB of onboard storage). That is to say, you might want a larger card if you plan to download many games.\nIf you want the best card, with the fastest speeds, and the most storage, then you\u2019ll want the 256GB Samsung Evo+. It runs for around $160 on Amazon, and ticks all the speed boxes (and then some) for the Switch. Alternatively, Microdia theoretically sells a 512GB microSD card, but it\u2019ll cost you a cool $1,000. \nAll-around good deal: Samsung\u2019s 128GB Evo+ is probably the sweet spot. At 128GB, it\u2019ll offer quadruple your Switch\u2019s built-in memory with a comfortable amount of storage. Samsung\u2019s Evo+ line is also highly rated with a recommendation from the testing crew over at The Wirecutter. It costs about $50 on Amazon, just a bit more than a slower $40 SanDisk card with the same capacity. \nUSB-C cables\nThe Switch comes with an USB-C charger that connects directly to the console or to the dock. But if you\u2019re planning on charging up your console on away from your TV and an electric socket, it will help have a few extra USB-C cables.\nAnker\u2019s USB Type-A to USB-C cables are cheap and reliable enough that you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about frying your new console. Alternatively, you can grab some $7 microUSB adapters and repurpose some of your existing cables instead. And if you\u2019ve already fully made the jump to USB-C, grab a spare USB-C to USB-C cable.\nAnd if you\u2019re going the full USB-C route, you\u2019ll probably want a spare charger for your wall, too. \nCase\nThe Switch\u2019s biggest selling point is the ability to take it with you on the go. To that end, you\u2019ll probably want a case. There\u2019s a whole bunch of options already up for preorder online, but without trying any of them out, it\u2019s hard to say for sure what\u2019s good. That said, PDP\u2019s $15 option looks like it should get the job done for basic protection of your new console. The fact that it isn\u2019t an eyesore helps.\nEthernet adapter\nIf you\u2019re planning on connecting your Switch to the internet through Ethernet, you\u2019ll need a USB adapter to use with the Switch dock. Nintendo has its own $30 branded one, but you\u2019ll probably want to skip that and just use a cheaper option instead.  \n\nNintendo Switch First Look\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
