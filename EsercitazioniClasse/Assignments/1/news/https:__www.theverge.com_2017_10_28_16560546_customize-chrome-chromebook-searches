{"title": "How to customize your Google Chrome and Chromebook searches", "content": " \nI just reviewed the Google Pixelbook and I think it\u2019s great \u2014 but Chrome OS is much more limited than either macOS or Windows when it comes to customizing how the core OS works. One of my favorite tools on the Mac is called Alfred, a tool that pops up a little search bar that can do basically anything you can think to program into it. I use it so much I have replaced my Caps Lock key with it and when I use a Chromebook, I miss it terribly.\nBut! Chromebooks have a similar text box, it\u2019s the Google search bar. But it\u2019s not as powerful as Alfred when it comes to customizing stuff. Luckily, Chrome has a hidden little feature that lets you customize how that search box works with different rules. \nIf you do a certain kind of internet search over and over again, customizing your search engines in Chrome can make that much easier. For me, obviously, it\u2019s searching The Verge, but I also have custom engines set up for YouTube, Amazon, news from the past week, and a few more things.\nSo, for example, when I want to search Amazon for something, I can just type \u201caz battery\u201d in my Chrome bar or in the Chromebook search bar and it just opens Amazon and searches for that thing.\nThose customizations aren\u2019t just limited to the Google search bar on Chromebooks. Basically, as long as you\u2019re logged into Chrome, your customizations for the search bar will sync across to any Chrome Browser you\u2019re using. So whether you use a Chromebook or just use the Chrome browser, here\u2019s how to supercharge your searches for the stuff you use most often. (Note, however, that these settings don\u2019t sync to Chrome on mobile nor to the Google app on mobile, which is annoying.)\nStep One: find the Manage search engines setting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing you have to do is actually find the darn setting you want. In Chrome, click the three-dot menu and go to settings, then scroll down to \u201cSearch engine\u201d and click on \u201cManage search engines.\u201d You can also just type \u201cengine\u201d in the search bar at the top of the settings, if you want.\nWhen you click in, you\u2019ll probably see an absolutely bogglingly large list of search engines listed. \u201cDon\u2019t I just use Google?\u201d you may ask. Yes, but here\u2019s what Chrome is doing: it keeps an eye on the websites you visit most and if it understands how to search those sites, it will eventually just add them to this list automatically.\nWhat this list does is set up the ability to do more than just \u201cGoogle it.\u201d So, for example, if you have visited 9to5Mac a bunch and then type \u201c9to5Mac.com iPhone,\u201d Chrome will limit that search to just that website.\nThough it\u2019s tempting, I do not recommend messing around with the \u201cdefault search\u201d section. You could, in theory, put some other search engine like Bing or DuckDuckGo in here, but generally speaking you should leave it alone. But, now that you\u2019re here, it\u2019s time to get customizing the other engines.\nStep Two: clean up (or don\u2019t)\nThis is an optional step, but I went through and manually removed a ton of sites from this list, so I could have an easier time seeing what search options I actually want. You have to click the three-dot menu next to each item and click \u201cRemove from list\u201d to eliminate it.\nBut you don\u2019t have to do this. For one, it\u2019s annoying that Google adds a ton of sites here automatically, so it\u2019ll take forever. For another, even after you do it, a bunch of sites will get re-added later. Lastly, I don\u2019t think having a million of these custom search engines in here hurts anything or slows anything down.\nIt\u2019s just helpful to see what you\u2019ve got saved. Bluntly, Google\u2019s tools for managing this stuff are so basic that you\u2019re going to get annoyed at some point in this process. Just a fair warning.\nStep Three: do a test search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick the thing you want to search and then... go search the thing. For this example, I\u2019m using Amazon. You just go to the website and type a search into the box. I recommend typing \u201ctest search\u201d in.\nOne you do the search, go look at the URL. Somewhere in that mess of & and # and % and whatever, you will actually see your \u201ctest search\u201d phrase. Amazon\u2019s looks like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=test+search\nNow, go to that URL and edit it, right there in the browser URL bar, and change \u201ctest search\u201d to \u201c%s\u201d (no quotes). \u201c%s\u201d is Chrome\u2019s way of saying \u201cthe search term goes here\u201d for custom searches. Don\u2019t hit enter after you swap it, just put in %s and copy it, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=%s\nStep Four: add your custom search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to your \u201cManage search engines\u201d screen and click add. There are three fields, here\u2019s how they work.\nSearch Engine: This is the text you\u2019ll see in the URL bar on the browser when you do the custom search. Put whatever description makes sense to you here.\nKeyword: This is how you\u2019ll trigger your custom search. Chrome usually defaults to making it the full name of a website, but that\u2019s annoying. I always pick something short. So for Amazon, I\u2019ve chosen \u201caz.\u201d I have a ton of these, and I have developed a little system for my codes so they\u2019re easier to remember. I\u2019m going to post a bunch of my favorites at the bottom of this article.\nURL with %s in place of query: That URL that you copied in the last step? Paste it here.\nWhen you\u2019re done, click save!\nStep Five: Try it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFire up a browser tab or hit the search button on your Chromebook and try your new search out. Use space between your keyword and your search term. In the browser bar, as soon as you hit space the bar should show the Search Engine name you chose. On a Chromebook, you won\u2019t get that visual feedback, but it should still work.\nSome of my favorite custom searches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tool has saved me a lot of extra keystrokes and time. I\u2019ve set up a bunch of time-limited Google searches so I don\u2019t have to manually dig into the \u201cSearch Tools\u201d field, for example. I\u2019ve also set up direct searches into a lot of other web services I use all the time. Here are just a few examples, as you can see I kind of ended up setting up a little system to group them in my mind:\n\n\ngm: a Google search that\u2019s just limited to links from the past month.https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&tbs=qdr:m\n\ngw: a Google search limited to the last weekhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%s&tbs=qdr:w\n\ngd: A Google search limited to the last 24 hourshttps://www.google.com/search?q=%s&tbs=qdr:d\n\ngh: A Google search limited to just the last hourhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%s&tbs=qdr:h\n\nt: A Twitter searchhttp://twitter.com/search?q=%s\n\ntu: Open the profile for a specific userhttps://twitter.com/%s\n\nSomething interesting I want to point out about that last one: it\u2019s not technically just a search. It\u2019s just a URL. That means you can use this trick to quickly open any webpage where you know it has a variable URL, but you don\u2019t want to bother with a bookmark for it. So if you\u2019re a hardcore reddit user, for example, you could set up a reddit shortcut to open up the latest posts in a subreddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause reddit has a pretty stable URL structure for its \u201cNew,\u201d \u201cHot,\u201d and \u201cTop\u201d sections, you could set up a little system to jump you directly into the section that you want. \nThis is pretty close to what I do when I want to jump to a specific place on my website, The Verge. The basics are the same for any URL and for most of the searches you might do on the web: if you find yourself clicking the same darn buttons over and over again, it might be easier to just set up a keyword for it in Chrome. Give it a try!\n"}
