{"title": "V-Moda's new Forza Metallo Wireless neckbuds are now available", "content": " \nV-Moda's Forza Metallo in-ear headphones are already out, to great reviews, but now the Bluetooth neckbud version is shipping. The Forza Metallo Wireless is a laundry list of features you'd want in a pair of neckbuds, including sweat resistance, detachable \"sport fins\" for keeping the earbuds in your ears when working out, and Qualcomm's aptX audio codec. V-Moda promises over ten hours of battery life, and there's quick charge functionality as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at this woman curling a dumbell in the park, for instance. Does this look like a woman who would settle for neckbuds without Qualcomm's aptX technology?\nOh, and you can buy 3D printed gold \"caps\" for your neckbuds for a mere $2,500, so that's good.\nThe Forza Metallo Wireless is available now in black or silver for $170.\n"}
