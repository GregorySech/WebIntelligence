{"title": "Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti on tweeting from space and brewing the first zero-g espresso", "content": " \nSamantha Cristoforetti is an Italian astronaut with the European Space Agency. She currently holds a few spaceflight records \u2014 including being the first person ever to brew an espresso in space. \nIn 2014 and 2015, Cristoforetti spent 199 days aboard the International Space Station, where she performed a variety of scientific experiments. She studied generations of fruit flies to chart gene changes in relation to disease; she looked after Caenorhabditis elegans worms used in a Japanese-led experiment; and she tended to plants to study how they grow in microgravity. \nfirst person ever to brew an espresso in space\nCristoforetti was supposed to return to Earth in May 2015, but her stay on the ISS was extended to June after a cargo ship flying on a Russian Soyuz rocket failed to reach the space station. The delay extended Cristoforetti\u2019s stay to 199 days, allowing her to collect the record for the longest single spaceflight by any female astronaut. (NASA astronaut Sunita Williams had previously held the record at 195 days.) Cristoforetti\u2019s record won\u2019t last for long, though. NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who\u2019s currently on the ISS, will soon surpass her.\nOne of her records, however, will stay forever. Shortly before retuning to Earth, Cristoforetti used a coffee machine called ISSpresso to brew the first ever espresso in space. She then put on a Star Trek uniform top and used a special zero gravity cup to sip it. \n\n\n\"Coffee: the finest organic suspension ever devised.\" Fresh espresso in the new Zero-G cup!

Here, she works on new technologies that could one day be used for a future mission to the Moon. She\u2019s \u201cdefinitely\u201d looking forward to going to space again though. \u201cHopefully it\u2019ll be my turn again eventually,\u201d she says. \nIn the meantime, The Verge spoke with Cristoforetti about how she became an astronaut, what scientific experiments she performed on the ISS, and what happened to that famous space espresso machine.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nYou studied abroad in the US when you were 18. Where did you go and why did you decide to do that? \nI was an exchange student in St. Paul, Minnesota. And the reason I wanted to do that is because that was a challenge. I was very fascinated by the idea of not much traveling, but really discovering other places, other cultures, really learning other languages. So I always knew that I wanted to take this opportunity of doing an exchange year abroad during my school time. While I didn\u2019t specifically choose St. Paul, Minnesota \u2014 that just happened \u2014 I chose the United States because already back then I was very much fascinated by space and science fiction, and, of course, the United States was, and still is, the leader in space exploration.\nI studied abroad as well when I was in high school because I was fascinated by the US in general, and ended up in the middle of nowhere in Kansas. How did that experience shape who you are now?\nI think it takes the scary aspect of going [to] a different place away because you do it at a pretty young age. That experience \u2014 that I\u2019m sure you also made in your middle of nowhere in Kansas \u2014 of cultural shock, it\u2019s something that\u2019s very important to experience, I think. As a teenager, you\u2019re still at that flexible attitude or that ability to just incorporate that into your frame, in your personality, in your experience, in your tool bag. And then you just take it on as you go. And so I think it helped me to make other decisions in my life about studying abroad, traveling abroad. I did my studies in Germany, and then I did part of it in France, and then I did my thesis in Moscow. And then, of course, right now I live and work in a very multicultural environment. I think that experience as a teenager, as a girl, gave me the confidence of making all these other choices moving on, and I think altogether they very much shaped who I am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with C. Elegans cultures.\nPhoto: ESA / NASA\n\n\nWhen and why did you decide to become an astronaut? \nIt goes back to childhood so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to say why, because that\u2019s an age when the decisions you make are not necessarily rational or conscious. I like to say that space chose me as opposed to me choosing space. I was just at that age when you get fascinated by something. Who knows why! The interesting thing is that, as I grew up, I developed a lot of more mature interests and passions, like science and technology and flying, and then again traveling abroad, different cultures, different languages. And all those things, all together, kept me on the path to space.\nIn 2014 and 2015, you spent 199 days on the International Space Station. What was your experience like?\nVery difficult to describe in a few words, because it\u2019s over six months of your life. It\u2019s a complex experience. You start out with a huge peak of excitement because I had worked all my life almost to get to space. I had desired it for pretty much all of my life. On the one hand, you have this aspect which is the fulfillment of this incredible dream, and it\u2019s almost, you\u2019re there, but you can hardly believe it really happened. But then it\u2019s also a job. You\u2019re there to perform, people have trained you and have invested in you for years, so you also have the whole pressure of performing your job correctly and living up to expectations for 199 days. \nAnd then you have the aspect of becoming an extraterrestrial being, really learning how to live outside of the planet, mainly living in weightlessness. And then there is the aspect of it being a home for six months and your crew mates being your family. [And then there is] the familiarity that you gain, on the one hand, for the space station, on the other hand, even for the entire Earth that you see out of the window every day. It\u2019s a very rich and complex experience that has many, many aspects to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: ESA / NASA\n\n\nA lot of astronauts say that going to space changes their lives. Has your stay on the ISS changed you?\nNo, I don\u2019t think it has. I think that\u2019s a little exaggerated, because that\u2019s what people really like to hear. But the truth of the matter is that when people come back and say, \u201cI have developed this appreciation for the fragility of our planet, or us being the caretakers of the planet and being all on the same boat,\u201d the truth is that probably we all think that anyway. Of course going to space is something that is visually present to you every single day, but it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know all those things before, right? It didn\u2019t change me in that sense.\nWhat scientific experiments did you work on on the ISS?\nQuite a lot. I think it\u2019s somewhere in between 200 and 250 experiments in one typical expedition of six months. Of course you don\u2019t have to deal directly with all of them. Some of them my crew mates did, some of them just run in the background and the crew doesn\u2019t even have to interact with them. Some of them, I just had to flip a switch or take samples and put them in the freezer, so I didn\u2019t have to do much. And then there\u2019s maybe a few dozens \u2014 maybe 40 to 60 \u2014 where as a crew member you are not only the operator but the actual subject. So the experiment is done on you as a human that adapts to being in space. All the experiments are pretty intensive, because you have to handle the samples, sometimes treat them, or fixate them. I even tried to raise fruit flies in space, an experiment with real animals which requires special or particular care from the side of astronauts.\nIs there anything about living in space that you miss?\nI am not a nostalgic person, so I hardly ever concentrate on what I miss of something, but if I think more positively about the next time that I will go to space and what I look forward to experiencing again, then it\u2019s weightlessness. It\u2019s a very unique feeling, the physical feeling of lightness and freedom and inhabiting space in three dimensions that is very very special. You can only experience it in space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's coffee in that nebula\"... ehm, I mean... in that #Dragon.\u201d\nPhoto: ESA / NASA\n\n\nYou became famous for making the first espresso in space. How did that happen? What\u2019s the story behind the espresso machine?\nI was approached by a company who thought it\u2019d be a great idea to send an espresso machine to space, and then another company who was really wanting to send the Italian espresso to space as a product, not a machine. And then this whole thing became this really cool project and the Italian Space Agency supported it, and they did an amazing job at it. They were a very young team of engineers in Torino, very motivated. Nobody believed at first that they\u2019d be able to send it in time for my expedition, because it was a pretty short leave time. Things you want to fly to space usually need some time for not only the engineering aspects, but all the safety review and all the boards that need to approve it. And you\u2019re talking about a machine that contains fluids at high temperature and high pressure \u2014 people get really nervous about safety. But they beat the odds and made it happen on time, barely in time, because I think it got up there in April and I was supposed to originally leave in May. But we were really excited.\nWhat happened to the espresso machine since then?\nI think the following crew were not great coffee drinkers, so I think it\u2019s being stored, put aside in a storage location. It\u2019s not in operational mode right now, but I think the next Italian astronaut who\u2019s flying to space this summer, he plans on unpacking it and installing it again. He\u2019s definitely getting some coffee capsules shipped in his personal little food allocation container.\nDid you choose any particular food?\nYes, I had pouches made for me. We have this opportunity as ESA astronauts, most of the time, to actually get a couple of recipes developed for us in a limited quantity. So I actually had a couple of recipes developed based on nutritional value, so really balanced meals where I could just open the pouch and it would have a whole meal in there. One was a quinoa salad with mackerel and dried tomatoes, which I usually added some olive oil to. And the other one was a chicken dish with mushrooms and peas.\n\nYou\u2019re quite popular for your social media posts from space. I was wondering, when you\u2019re up on the ISS, how do you decide what to post?\nOne thing I did is pictures, so nice things you see from the window that you can take a picture of and you post it, and that\u2019s usually what attracts the most attention on social media. And then there are the other things which require a little bit more work, although they actually attract less attention, which is reporting what you actually do. In fact, for at least the first half of one of my missions I made it a point to post almost daily blogs describing the experiments that I was doing and the different activities, although I decided they do not attract half as much attention as my pictures, unfortunately. But I did feel committed to not only share pictures but actually also content on what I was doing, so I tried to do that as well.\nI loved your video taking a tour of the ISS toilet. What was the feedback?\nAh the toilet! Well, I don\u2019t know what the feedback was when it was posted, because when you\u2019re in space you\u2019re a little bit in a bubble, so you don\u2019t really know exactly what happens. But I still see it sometimes reposted, even nowadays that it\u2019s been two years, so I think it was well received. It\u2019s just something that everybody is always curious about, so every time somebody in the world writes about a blog or an article about life in space, they will link to it. I mean, not only to mine, other astronauts have done it, but I get my share.\nWas the video your idea?\nYes, yes, that was my idea. You see, unfortunately it\u2019s very difficult to do detailed videos about the work we do because when you do work, you don\u2019t really have the time to do a video. When you do an experiment, you\u2019re on a tight schedule. That experiment is meant to take an hour and you really only have an hour for it, so it\u2019s really difficult to make extra time. Plus, it would not be very professional because if then you get delayed, people would say, why were you doing a video instead of working? So the only things that you can really take the time and document and try to make a nice video about are the things that are more like life onboard. That\u2019s why you will mostly find videos about the toilet, the gym, and washing. These are things that people are curious about, but then on the other hand, they\u2019re also the things that we had a chance to document because we can do that in our free time, without impacting work. \nHow are you trying to inspire more women to get into STEM?\nI think you should not make an effort about that, you should just be yourself. If you are in a position like I am where you can be an example of somebody who did a career in STEM, I am one of those people who think that you are a role model by being not by talking. So I\u2019m usually not somebody who really goes out and tries to dispense advice, also because I think it\u2019s difficult to give advice to large groups of people. But I\u2019m appreciative of the fact that I\u2019m in a position of being a role model. So I just try to be myself and show that there are things that you can do, that they are an option, and then a young girl, young women, can take from it whatever they need and it\u2019s useful for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you up to right now?\nI have a number of tasks. I work at the European Astronaut Centre, which is in Cologne. And I\u2019m responsible for an initiative which is called the Spaceship EAC Initiative. There\u2019s an idea of growing consensus internationally that we would like some time in the second half of the next decade to have human missions to the Moon, to build a habitat around the Moon, in cislunar space, and then have human missions to the Moon. And so there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in terms of technology development, but especially with things like operational concepts. The work is very much done with students. We just kind of scan ideas and see if an idea is good enough that we can then insert it into a wider European Space Agency ecosystem so it can be developed. \nI\u2019m also responsible for a project we\u2019re doing here to build with a relatively low budget lunar simulator, an enclosed surface under a dome where we\u2019re going to put a bed of regolith simulant and a habitat simulator, and also a demonstrator of carbon-free energy supply based on solar panels, electrolytes, and fuel cells. I\u2019m also responsible for a project that looks more into radiation and radiation protection, which is potentially one of the big problems that we will encounter as we do spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit, because we\u2019re not as protected from radiation as we are at the altitude where the space station is right now. And I\u2019m also part of the working group that looks into cooperation with the Chinese Space Agency, which is something that we want to serve and develop in the next years.\nWhat does the future of space travel look like in your opinion?\nI think from the point of view of government agencies \u2014 NASA, ESA, JAXA, and so on \u2014 there\u2019s focus, on the one hand, on continuing the International Space Station, but [on the other hand] I think there\u2019s consensus now about the next step being the lunar vicinity. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see for the next decade. At the same time, of course, there\u2019s proliferation of private initiatives and that\u2019s a bit more difficult to say where they\u2019re going. You have announcements of private initiatives concerned more with asteroids, Mars and I think it\u2019s too hard for me to judge how realistic those are. It\u2019s exciting but I don\u2019t have enough insights to understand whether they\u2019re feasible or not.\nWould you ever like to go to Mars?\nOf course I would like to, but realistically speaking I think this is probably something for the next generation at least of European astronauts. It\u2019s going to be a little bit down the line. But as far as I get to stay in my career and [get] an opportunity to do something cislunar, for example, I will consider myself already very, very fortunate.\n"}
