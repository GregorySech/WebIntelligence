{"title": "Spotify announces three new original podcasts about the music industry", "content": " \nSpotify just announced three new original podcasts, TechCrunch reports. The podcasts will feature discussions about musical moments on TV, daily interviews with people in the creative industry, and the life of music industry exec Chris Lighty. \nShowstopper, which premiered today, is hosted by The Fader\u2019s Naomi Zeichner, who will interview music supervisors for popular television shows like Girls and Stranger Things. Unpacked will be hosted by Broad City\u2019s music supervisor Matt FX and Spotify Studios\u2019 talent manager Michele Santucci. The duo will interview \u201call manner of creative folks,\u201d beginning at SXSW on March 14th. And lastly, The Chris Lighty Story will be about a music industry exec who worked with the likes of Nas, 50 Cent, and Missy Elliott before passing away in 2012. It will premiere sometime in April. \nThe move follows Spotify\u2019s announcement back in 2015 that it would start hosting podcasts from places like Comedy Central and Vice News. As TechCrunch points out, the service also very timidly stepped into original podcast territory with the launch of the election podcast Clarify last fall. But these new podcasts are proof that Spotify is serious about original content, even when it comes to mediums it\u2019s not normally known for. \nSpotify says it will announce more originals later this year. \n"}
