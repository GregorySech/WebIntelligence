{"title": "Marvel and Star Wars movies will be exclusive to Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming service", "content": " \nDisney has decided what to do with Marvel and Star Wars films once they leave theaters: keep them exclusive to the company\u2019s upcoming streaming service.\nLast month, Disney announced that it would launch a streaming service in 2019 that will focus on the studio\u2019s shows and movies. But it hadn\u2019t been decided at the time whether the service would include all Disney movies \u2014 including Marvel and Star Wars films \u2014 or just titles focused on younger audiences, like Disney Channel and Pixar properties.\n\u201cWe're going to launch big, and we're going to launch hot.\u201d\nA month later, it seems that Disney has decided. According to CNBC and Deadline, Disney CEO Bob Iger said at a conference today that the two hit film series would be part of the same streaming bundle. \"We're going to launch big, and we're going to launch hot,\u201d Iger reportedly said.\nKeeping Marvel and Star Wars with the rest of Disney\u2019s properties will make the service a lot more appealing and may also mean one fewer subscription that people have to keep up; Disney had considered breaking the two properties out into yet another streaming offering, since their content is so distinct.\nThe decision also means that Netflix \u2014 which currently has an exclusive deal with Disney to stream its new films \u2014 may not have any major titles from Disney after 2019, when their partnership ends. When Disney announced its streaming service in August, Netflix said that it continued \u201cto do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts,\u201d and it appeared to be negotiating for continued access to some of the studio\u2019s films. Clearly whatever Netflix offered wasn\u2019t enough.\nIger said he plans to discuss pricing for Disney\u2019s streaming service \u201cin the months ahead.\u201d With the service not slated to launch for over a year, though, Disney still has plenty of time to figure that out.\n"}
