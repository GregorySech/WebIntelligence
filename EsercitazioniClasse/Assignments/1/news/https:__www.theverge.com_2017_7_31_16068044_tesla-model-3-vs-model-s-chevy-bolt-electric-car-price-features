{"title": "How the Tesla Model 3 compares to the Model S and Chevy Bolt", "content": " \nThe Tesla Model 3 is finally (kind of) here. The first 30 Model 3s to roll off the production line were handed over to Tesla employees with reservations at an event this past weekend, and the company now begins the uphill climb of filling the 500,000 other preorders. The introduction of the production version of the Model 3 also meant we finally learned exactly what this car will be capable of. So how does it stack up against the competition? \nThere are certainly more electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and even hydrogen fuel cell cars available than there were when Tesla got started, but there are just four cars with more than 200 miles of range: the Tesla Model 3, the Model S, the Model X, and the Chevy Bolt. Let\u2019s leave the extremely pricey Model X out of the equation here and focus on the other three to get the best sense of how the Model 3 measures up.\n\n\nTesla Model 3 vs. Tesla Model S vs. Chevy Bolt\n\n\n\nSpecification\nTesla Model 3\nTesla Model S\nChevy Bolt\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nTesla Model 3\nTesla Model S\nChevy Bolt\n\n\n\n\nBase price\n$35,000\n$69,500\n$37,495\n\n\nBattery \n~50\u201355kWh, reportedly\n75kWh\n60kWh\n\n\nRange\n220 miles \n249 miles\n238 miles\n\n\nFast charging\n130 miles / 30 minutes at Supercharger\n170 miles / 30 minutes at Supercharger\nOptional (90 miles / 30 minutes)\n\n\nHome charging (240 volt)\n30 miles / hour\n52 miles / hour\n25 miles / hour\n\n\nTop speed\n130 mph\n140 mph\n93 mph\n\n\n0\u201360 mph time\n5.6 seconds\n4.3 seconds\n6.5 seconds\n\n\nHorsepower\nN/A\n382 hp\n200 hp\n\n\nDrive\nRear-wheel drive (AWD optional in 2018)\nRear-wheel drive (AWD optional)\nFront-wheel drive\n\n\nWheels\n18 inches (19 inches optional)\n19 inches (21 inches optional)\n17 inches\n\n\nDisplays\nOne 15-inch, center-mounted horizontal touchscreen\nOne 17-inch, center-mounted vertical touchscreen, one 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nOne 10.2-inch, center-mounted touchscreen display, one 8-inch digital instrument cluster\n\n\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi / LTE / Bluetooth\nWi-Fi / LTE / Bluetooth\nWi-Fi / LTE / Bluetooth\n\n\nWarranty\n4 years / 50,000 miles\n4 years / 50,000 miles\n3 years / 36,000 miles\n\n\nBattery warranty\n8 years / 100,000 miles\n8 years / infinite miles\n8 years / 100,000 miles\n\n\nApple CarPlay\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nAndroid Auto\nNo \nNo\nYes\n\n\nOver-the-air software updates\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nKeyless entry\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nRemote start\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nLane keep assist \nOptional (part of $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package)\nOptional (part of $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package)\nOptional\n\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nOptional (part of $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package)\nOptional (part of $5,000 Enhanced Autopilot package)\nNo\n\n\nCollision avoidance / automatic emergency braking\nYes\nYes\nOptional\n\n\nLegroom (front)\n42.7 inches\n42.7 inches\n41.6 inches\n\n\nLegroom (rear)\n35.2 inches\n35.4 inches\n36.5 inches\n\n\nHeadroom (front)\n39.6 inches\n38.8 inches\n39.7 inches\n\n\nHeadroom (rear)\n37.7 inches\n35.3 inches\n37.9 inches\n\n\nShoulder room (front)\n56.3 inches\n57.7 inches\n54.6 inches\n\n\nShoulder room (rear)\n54.0 inches\n55.0 inches\n52.8 inches\n\n\nHip room (front)\n53.4 inches\n55.0 inches\n51.6 inches\n\n\nHip room (rear)\n52.4 inches\n54.7 inches\n50.8 inches\n\n\nCargo volume\n15.0 cubic feet\n31.6 cubic feet\n16.9 cubic feet\n\n\nNew order delivery date\n12\u201318 months\n1 month\nImmediate (based on dealer availability)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart tells a big part of the story here, but certainly not all of it. For one thing, Tesla\u2019s not selling the $35,000 base model right away. The company claims that in order to quickly ramp up production, it needs to focus on the longer range (310-mile) battery first. It\u2019s also requiring people who want those first deliveries to add on the premium trim package. So if you are one of the early Model 3 reservation holders and you want your car as soon as possible, you\u2019re going to have to pay at least $49,000. And even when the base-level Model 3 becomes available, you\u2019ll only be able to order it in black. Otherwise the price goes up at least $1,000 before you add on any other options. \n\n\nHere\u2019s how the Model 3 stacks up against similarly-priced luxury sedans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Tesla\n\n\nOf course, not everyone who\u2019s considering buying a Model 3 is dead set on transitioning to an electric car. Some people are looking at the Model 3 as a competitor to cars like BMW\u2019s 3 Series, or the Volvo S90. Does the Model 3 hold up against any of those, even with all the options?\n\n\nThe Chevy Bolt has a higher base price than the Model 3, and it\u2019s also missing some desirable safety features like lane keep assist and collision avoidance, as well as the option for fast charging. In order to get those more advanced safety features, you have to buy the \u201cPremier\u201d trim version of the Bolt, which brings the price up to $42,760. Adding the option for DC fast charging will bump the price to $43,510. \nOf course, all of these prices can change depending on whether you can get help from a federal or state tax credit. The US government has been partially subsidizing the cost of clean vehicles like EVs and plug-in hybrids in order to help grow the market, and they can take a significant chunk out of the price of these cars. \nA $7,500 federal tax credit is available for each of these cars, but the state credit changes based on where you live. In California, for example, you could receive up to $2,500 in addition to the federal tax credit, bringing something like the Model 3\u2019s base price down to $25,000. The state credits scale depending on which tax bracket you\u2019re in, though, and there are other factors that could change the total amount. It\u2019s worth investigating how your own state handles these clean vehicle rebates. (This post from Edmunds is a good place to start, as is this interactive map from Plug-in America.)\nThat\u2019s a nice federal tax credit. Shame if something were to happen to it...\nThere\u2019s a bigger catch here, though: the full $7,500 federal tax credit only applies for the first 200,000 eligible vehicles that a manufacturer sells. After that, the rebate decreases by 50 percent every six months until it\u2019s retired. Tesla has sold over 100,000 vehicles and will likely hit the 200,000 mark sometime in early 2018. With such a vast backlog of preorders, it\u2019s hard to say how much of the federal rebate will be available to new reservations, or whether it will be available at all by the time they complete their orders. \nThe Bolt might be in safer territory here. Chevrolet has much more manufacturing capacity than Tesla, but sales of the Bolt have been slow since the car became available at the very end of 2016. Chevy makes other rebate-eligible cars, like the Volt, which has sold fairly well and been around for longer. But its parent company GM isn\u2019t expected to reach the 200,000-car mark until 2018 or 2019 at the earliest.\nAll this aside though, there are pluses and minuses to each of these three EVs. The Model S is the most capable, but the most expensive. The Model 3 is potentially the cheapest, but also the least available. The Bolt is a great middle ground, and is available now, though it doesn\u2019t come with the same kind of luxury touch that Tesla is known for. What\u2019s certain is that the competition is only going to increase. We\u2019re likely to see a handful of EVs with 200 or more miles of range hit the market in the next year or so, with the 2018 Nissan Leaf leading the charge. \n"}
