{"title": "Watch this dancing Pikachu get dragged mercilessly offstage for deflating mid-performance", "content": " \nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Festival 2017 happened this past weekend in Songdo, South Korea, and what\u2019s a proper festival without a choreographed Pikachu dance? Visitors patiently waited in line for a glimpse of the dancing Pikachu parade as well as the opening of a Pok\u00e9mon pop-up shop, and they were treated to a scene straight out of a Korean gangster mob movie, as shown in the video above. \nAround 1:01, the main Pikachu in the center starts deflating, prompting staff members to rush in and drag him away like he was going straight to pok\u00e9mon jail. In the absolute best timing possible, Pikachu\u2019s head starts melting right as Nikki Blonsky sings, \u201cAnd you can try to stop my dancing feet\u201d and the organizers were like, \u201cOkay.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDeflating Pikachu? Not on my watch.\u201d\nGIF: Green Lime / YouTube\n\n\nThe other Pikachu performers dance on, presumably shivering inside their costumes now that they know what becomes of them if they make one wrong move. And then at 4:35, the deflated Pikachu attempts to make a comeback, but it just isn\u2019t meant to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIF: Green Lime / YouTube\n\n\nYou tried, buddy. \n"}
