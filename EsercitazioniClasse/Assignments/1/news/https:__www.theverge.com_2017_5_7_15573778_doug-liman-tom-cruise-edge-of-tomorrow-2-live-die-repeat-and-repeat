{"title": "Doug Liman has a familiar title for Edge of Tomorrow 2", "content": " \nLast year, Doug Liman signed on to direct a sequel to his 2014 military science fiction time travel film Edge of Tomorrow, and while promoting his next film, The Wall, he told Collider that the film\u2019s sequel will be called Live Die Repeat and Repeat. \nSet in the future when Earth has been attacked by aliens, Edge of Tomorrow follows a cowardly public relations officer played by Cruise, who\u2019s sent to the front lines. There, he finds himself in a time loop where he lives the same day over and over again, and enlists help from a fellow soldier, played by Blunt, to escape. While the film didn\u2019t perform well at the box office, it\u2019s a surprisingly good film. Since its release, a sequel has been put into development, while Cruise and Blunt are reportedly interested in coming back. \n\u2018Edge of Tomorrow\u2019 is the blandest of bland titles for a science fiction film\nHowever, Edge of Tomorrow is the blandest of bland titles when it comes to a science fiction film, especially when you consider that the book it\u2019s based on is called All You Need Is Kill. The title was bad enough that the film was essentially retitled Live Die Repeat for the home release. The sequel\u2019s title shows that everyone involved seems to have realized that Edge of Tomorrow is a title best forgotten. \nWhile news of a title and an update is exciting to hear for those wanting a sequel, it\u2019s not entirely clear when the movie will happen. While Liman has signed on to return,  and has a story that\u2019s fittingly a \u201cprequel and a sequel,\u201d the film has yet to be officially greenlit. Additionally, Liman has several other projects on his plate. His next film, The Wall, hits theaters this week, and last August, he left Fox\u2019s Gambit movie for DC\u2019s Justice League Dark. He\u2019s also attached to another science fiction film with Tom Cruise, Luna Park. Hopefully, Live Die Repeat and Repeat will make its way to the top of the list. Until then, we can watch Edge of Tomorrow over and over again. \n"}
