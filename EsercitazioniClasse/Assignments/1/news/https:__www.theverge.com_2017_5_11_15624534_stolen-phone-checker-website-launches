{"title": "It's really easy to check if you're buying a stolen phone", "content": " \nIf you\u2019re buying a used phone, there\u2019s always been one critical thing to look out for: whether the device is stolen. And finding that out is getting a bit easier today. The US wireless industry, through its trade group the CTIA, has launched a tool called the Stolen Phone Checker, which lets you look up whether a phone has been reported lost or stolen.\nThe site works by looking up a device\u2019s IMEI, MEID, or ESN \u2014 unique codes that get assigned to every phone. These are sometimes printed on the back of phones, like the iPhone, but in other cases they can be found somewhere deep in the settings menu.\nStolen phones won\u2019t be able to get service\nChecking this out before buying a used phone is important for a handful of reasons. But perhaps the simplest is that if the phone you get turns out to be lost or stolen, it pretty much won\u2019t work. For several years now, US phone carriers have kept a shared database of stolen phone IDs, and they won\u2019t allow those devices to be connected to their network.\nThe CTIA\u2019s tool isn\u2019t the first of its kind. There are a handful of third-party lookup tools out there \u2014 like this one from Swappa \u2014 and the big carriers have their own, too. But it sounds like the Stolen Phone Checker is being positioned as the canonical site for looking these things up. And if nothing else, it has the easiest name to remember. So if you\u2019re buying a device off Craigslist, eBay, or some other used phone dealer, be sure to check one of these sites first.\n"}
