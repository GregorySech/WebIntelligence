{"title": "The HTC Vive just got a $200 price cut", "content": " \nHTC has cut the price of its Vive virtual reality headset by $200, bringing the system\u2019s cost down to $599. The discount is meant to stimulate consumer interest in the system, and make it easier to afford accessories, including the Vive Tracker that went on sale earlier this year. It also comes with a one-month free trial of HTC\u2019s Viveport subscription service, which offers access to a selection of VR games. \u201cWe want to really significantly boost VR adoption now across the globe,\u201d says Vive US general manager Dan O\u2019Brien, as the Vive\u2019s second holiday season approaches. \u201cWe think now is the right time to reset the price.\u201d\nThis price drop mirrors the Oculus Rift\u2019s $200 price cut in March, and it brings the Vive closer to the Rift\u2019s current $499 list price. (It\u2019s temporarily $399 as part of a summer sale.) O\u2019Brien says that just like Oculus has promised with the Rift, the current-generation Vive isn\u2019t going away any time soon. \u201cThis is not about clearing the channel to make room for another product. We do expect this version of Vive to stay in market well into 2018,\u201d he says. Users can upgrade it with wireless adapters, a new head strap, and other other add-ons. \u201cWe don\u2019t want users to feel like they\u2019re always having to be [up-sold] into new hardware. We do want to make sure that things that we make around the Vive today continue to work with it.\u201d\nThe current-generation Vive should stay on sale \u201cwell into 2018\u201d\nO\u2019Brien notes that HTC has upgraded elements like the Vive\u2019s cable system without declaring a new generation of hardware, and says that kind of iterative design will probably continue for some time. However, Vive co-creator Valve has been showing off one upgrade that might not come out for a while: a set of majorly redesigned motion controllers. O\u2019Brien says the new controllers are still in their prototype stage, though developers have started getting versions of them for testing. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on consumer versions of those.\u201d\nThe new price cut doesn\u2019t affect the Vive\u2019s $1,200 Business Edition package, which is aimed at arcades and other commercial enterprises. O\u2019Brien says that these commercial editions make up a minority of Vive sales, but they\u2019re still a substantial part of the business \u2014 especially in China, where HTC estimates that they\u2019re in 60 to 70 percent of an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 total arcades in the country.\nThe Vive\u2019s intense setup process and general clunkiness still makes it more of a choice for hardcore enthusiasts than casual VR buyers. But today\u2019s discount is good news for anyone who\u2019s been interested in the system but balked at its previous $799 price tag, especially since VR-ready computers have gotten significantly cheaper since its launch in the spring of 2016.\nCorrection: The Oculus Rift is currently $499, not $599.\n"}
