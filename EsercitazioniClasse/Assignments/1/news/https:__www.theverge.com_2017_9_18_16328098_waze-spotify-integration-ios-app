{"title": "Waze integrates Spotify into its iOS app", "content": " \nWaze has finally integrated Spotify into its iOS app, six months after it came to Android. The integration will allow users to control Spotify within the Waze app, instead of having to switch apps while driving. \nUsers can control song playback, view recently played songs, and access Spotify recommendations right within Waze. And if you need to jump into the Spotify app you can access it by tapping the \u201cgo to Spotify\u201d button instead of going through the multitasking menu or jumping home and searching for the app. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaze says the integration will roll out over the next few weeks to iOS users.\n"}
