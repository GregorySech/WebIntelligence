{"title": "Spotify has more than 60 million subscribers now", "content": " \nSpotify has just updated its subscriber information, and it now has more than 60 million paying users. That means the company is up 10 million subscribers since March, when it last announced it had 50 million. As of last month, Spotify said it had 140 million total users. \nSince it last released subscriber numbers, a few things have changed for Spotify. Most crucially, the company reached licensing agreements with Universal Music Group and Sony. The deals will give these labels\u2019 artists the option to keep their music off of Spotify\u2019s free tier for a certain period of time, while Spotify will get a slight break in royalty payments.\n As Variety points out, Spotify is also expected to go public before the end of this year. \nThese numbers make Spotify twice as big, subscriber-wise, as Apple Music, which last month announced it had 27 million paying subscribers. \n\n"}
