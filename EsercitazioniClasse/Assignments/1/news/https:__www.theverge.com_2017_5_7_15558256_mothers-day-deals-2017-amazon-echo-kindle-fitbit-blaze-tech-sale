{"title": "Mother's Day deals 2017: $30 off Amazon Echo, $50 off Fitbit Blaze, and more in tech", "content": " \nFriendly reminder: Mother\u2019s Day is seven days away \u2014 May 14th, to be exact \u2014 and now is the perfect time to get her something special if you haven\u2019t already. Several online retailers, including Amazon and Microsoft, have some great promotions that double as excellent gifts for your mom.\nWithout further ado, here are our favorite deals of the week:\n\nStarting today through May 13th, Amazon is discounting their best devices including the Echo, Kindle, and Fire. You can save $30 on the Echo, $25 on Fire HD 8 tablet, and $20\u2013$50 on various Kindle models. We\u2019ve seen Fire and Kindle deals the past few months but this is the first time this year that the Echo is discounted so I recommend jumping on this if you\u2019re in the market for one.\nFitbit is celebrating Mother\u2019s Day with up to 50 percent off select items. Grab the Alta HR and Charge 2 for $20 off, Alta for $30 off, Flex 2 for $40 off, and Blaze for $50 off. Select accessories are also up to 50 percent off like this Slim Band + Frame for the Blaze.\nYou can also score some of the Fitbit deals on Microsoft\u2019s Store, but perhaps their most notable deal is up to $150 off the Surface Pro 4. And while not on sale, this Kate Spade Printed Sleeve from their Mother\u2019s Day gift guide is a nice way to protect her shiny new tablet.\nStarting at just $49.99, B&H Photo has the super popular Fujifilm instax mini 8 Instant Film Camera on sale in a kit that includes free film. Also if you (or your mom) happen to be really into photography, the Nikon D500 DSLR Camera we reviewed back in October is $670 off with 16-80mm Lens and $200 off without the lens.\nEnding soon on May 9th, Beats by Dr. Dre Solo2 Wired On-Ear Headphones are 20 percent off on Groupon. I\u2019m certain my mom would love these because pink is her favorite color (and she prefers headphones over earbuds), so I might just have to snatch up these hot pink beauties.\n\nLooking for gaming deals?
