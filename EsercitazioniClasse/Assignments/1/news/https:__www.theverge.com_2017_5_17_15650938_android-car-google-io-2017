{"title": "The rise of the Android-powered car", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s thesis to the automotive industry came packaged in a red glinting Maserati Ghibli. \nThe luxury sedan, parked outside last year\u2019s Google I/O developer conference, might have looked like just another sports car \u2014 a ubiquitous sight in Silicon Valley. But what was inside captured the interest of automakers. And now, some automakers are buying into what they found, despite long-held fears of giving up too much control to outsiders like Google. \n\u201cThe traction we\u2019re seeing in the car space is just ridiculous,\u201d Patrick Brady, vice president of engineering for Android, told The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising even to us and has caught us off guard.\u201d\nThe traction we\u2019re seeing in the car space is just ridiculous\nLast year, Google introduced a new version of Android, the mobile operating system designed for smartphones and tablets. Google tweaked Android so automakers could use it to run the infotainment system in cars, as well as functions like heating and cooling, opening and closing the windows, and even the instrument cluster where drivers find the speedometer and fuel gauge.\nAndroid engineers retrofitted the Maserati Ghibli with a vertical 15-inch touchscreen to showcase what this new infotainment user interface \u2014 and all the apps that go with it \u2014 might look like. \nThe concept marked a turning point for automakers that have traditionally used their own proprietary software \u2014 a strategy that costs millions of dollars and years to develop, only to be surpassed by the technology and ease-of-use found in a smartphone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dieter Bohn\u00a0/ The Verge\n\n\nAutomakers began questioning why they would build something from scratch once they saw Google\u2019s demonstration, which was more advanced than in-house systems that had been under development for a year, Brady said. \nAutomakers, from Hyundai to Jeep, are already adopting Google\u2019s Android Auto product, an in-car platform released in 2015 that brings the functions and look of a smartphone to the vehicle\u2019s central screen. Its closest competitor, Apple CarPlay, introduced a similar product to production cars that same year.\nAndroid Auto is in cars, but it\u2019s not an operating system. It\u2019s the HMI layer \u2014 or a secondary interface \u2014 that sits on top of the operating system. Android is an open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux and is designed for smartphones and tablets. \nUsing the Android operating system in cars is a much bigger deal.\n\u201cAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay was a way of giving consumers what they wanted without letting Google or Apple through the gate,\u201d said Jim Hines, research director at Gartner. \u201cBut now, Android as the operating system, well that\u2019s really the heart of the system.\u201d\nAudi and Volvo are the first automakers to publicly express interest in bringing the Android operating system into their cars. The two automakers announced partnerships with Google ahead of I/O developer\u2019s conference that kicks off today. Google will have demonstrations of running on an Audi Q8 and a Volvo V90 sport utility vehicle. \nVolvo says it expects to start shipping new cars with an Android operating system in about two years, a spokesman said. Audi is taking a more cautious approach. The company says it hasn\u2019t decided whether to bring Android in production cars, but is working on concepts, a spokeswoman said.  \nGoogle has an opportunity to burrow further into lives of consumers\nAudi says using Android would allow it to speed up development of its infotainment systems and tap into the millions of Android developers who create and program new apps and functions.\nFor consumers, this could mean the infotainment systems found in cars might finally meet the same level of functionality and design found on their smartphones. \nGoogle believes taking Android and moving that into the car as a kind of a turn-key platform will dramatically lower the cost of development for automakers. \nAutomakers including Honda, Hyundai, and GM have used older versions of the Android operating system in cars. And Google has worked with automakers to weave its services like Google Maps into a car\u2019s proprietary software. But both methods were slow and expensive. For example, bringing Google Earth to Audi vehicles in 2012 model-year vehicles took years, Brady said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we see the same kind of pick up and innovation that we saw in smartphones when Android came out and people were churning out smartphones at a dizzying rate,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe think we\u2019ll see the same thing in automotive, where cars can innovate faster and come to market faster.\u201d \nIn other words, Google has an opportunity to burrow even further into the lives of consumers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dieter Bohn \u00a0/ The Verge\n\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s reasonable, where in the future, most of the cars have an infotainment system powered by Android,\u201d said Brady. \u201cA car is a pretty important computer that a person interacts with on a daily basis,\u201d he continued, noting that a person in the US spends on average 50 plus minutes in their car every day. \u201cIf they\u2019re using Google services in the car, whether it\u2019s Google maps or Google Assistant and they have a good experience, they\u2019re more likely to use those services on other devices, where maybe we do have a way to monetize through ads or something else.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we see the same kind of pick up and innovation that we saw in smartphones.\u201d\nThe early adoption of Android in cars is ramping up just as Waymo \u2014 the Google self-driving car project that spun out to become a business \u2014 is speeding up its plans. The two areas seem destined to one day collide. \n\u201cYou do need an infotainment platform even in self-driving cars we think,\u201d Brady said, emphasizing that there are currently no plans to work with Waymo. \u201cA modern platform like Android gives you the ability to do more seamlessly integrate with the car. We think there are a lot of opportunities out there.\u201d\n\n"}
