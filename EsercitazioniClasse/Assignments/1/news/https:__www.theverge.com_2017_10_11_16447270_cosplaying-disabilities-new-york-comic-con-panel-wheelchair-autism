{"title": "How costumers are using cosplay to overcome mental and physical disabilities", "content": " One of the most beautiful things about New York Comic Con this past weekend was the diverse array of attendees at the four-day celebration. New York\u2019s Jacob Javits Convention Center and its surrounding streets were filled with children, senior citizens, couples, families, seasoned cosplayers, self-proclaimed \u201cblerds\u201d  a portmanteau for \u201cblack nerds\u201d , and everyone in between. It was hard to not be moved by the inclusive nature of the event, where thousands of people came to express their fandom for whatever character or property they identify with, whether that meant simply watching the crowd, or arriving in elaborate costumes they crafted themselves. Some of the most creative cosplayers, however, were those with disabilities. At this year\u2019s NYCC, it was hard to miss the significant number of people eagerly taking to the show floor in wheelchairs or walkers. On the final day of the convention, a panel called \u201cCosplay and Disabilities\u201d highlighted those fans, who noted an apparent uptick in disabled attendees this year. \"I think I\u2019ve seen more wheelchairs this year than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Dylan \u201cDozenFingers\u201d Cohen, a cosplayer with Tourette syndrome who was dressed as Son Goku from the Dragon Ball manga. \u201cAnd they\u2019re troopers, they really are.\u201d The panel on Cosplaying and Disabilities. From the left: David Vogel, Dylan Cohen, Nathan Gonzales, Justin Santiago, Joseph Munisteri, Startdust Megu, and Harujuku Chic.The panelists described conventions like New York Comic Con as judgement-free zones that allowed them to unleash their creativity through costuming. But cosplay also lets them improve their social skills and seek out friends with common interests. \u201cCosplay has helped my disability in that I have ADHD as well as autism,\u201d explained social worker and activist Joseph \u201cDopple Cosplay\u201d Munisteri. The inclusive environment of cosplayers helped him learn to socialize, he said, while the attention costuming requires let him learn to focus better, through something he\u2019s actively passionate about. \u201cSchoolwork, you don\u2019t always want to do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut [cosplaying] is something you want to do.\u201dAnother panelist, Justin \u201cLionHeart cosplay\u201d Santiago, had similar experiences. \u201cI\u2019m diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. So learning about that is like following patterns, repetitions. This helped me construct some kind of order.\u201d Santiago says he was reclusive during his childhood, and had trouble socializing, but cosplaying allowed him to come out of his shell and make new friends. \"It\u2019s changed my life so much, and I\u2019m eternally grateful to it.\u201dSantiago also noted that his fellow panelists with physical disabilities were often pushed to design more creative costumes due to their conditions, though that sometimes gives them a broader canvas to work with. \u201cLast year we had someone who made his wheelchair look like an Iron Throne,\u201d he explained. That said, building a costume around crutches or a chair isn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s led to companies like nonprofit Magic Wheelchair, which focuses specifically on helping children dress up and stylize their wheelchairs so they don\u2019t feel excluded.Magic Wheelchair\u2019s regional director, David Vogel, was also on the panel. He explained that he originally came from a toy-making background, and joined the initiative after losing his brother to muscular dystrophy. Vogel said his latest project was for a child named A.J. who suffers from Rett syndrome and is obsessed with the Nick Jr. show Blaze and the Monster Machines. The Magic Wheelchair team was able to raise enough money to transform A.J.\u2019s wheelchair into the Blaze vehicle, complete with custom 3D-printed parts. David Vogel of Magic Wheelchair.Other wheelchaired cosplayers on the convention floor often had friends or family members by their side who helped them assemble their costumes. David, a fourth-year attendee from the Bronx, explained that was exactly how he\u2019d been able to put together his impressive Professor X costume. \u201cIt lets you be someone different for a day,\u201d he said, a common sentiment across cosplayers in wheelchairs. The focus is drawn away from their disability, he explained, and centered on the character they\u2019re bringing to life instead.David from the Bronx cosplaying as Professor X.Professor X is one of the few comics characters with a physical disability who is relatable for disabled cosplayers. Otherwise, representation of mental and physical disabilities in the comic and anime worlds is few and far between. \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be enough representation,\u201d said Munisteri. \u201cThere is a comic book out there called Hydro Girl, which is written and drawn by these awesome people in Australia. It\u2019s about a girl who suffers from hydrocephalus.\u201d Beyond Hydro Girl, Munisteri mentioned a UK-based comic called Department of Ability. The creator of the comic has a daughter in a wheelchair, and wanted to turn her into a superhero, so she felt like she had someone to connect with while reading comics. The Venture Bros. also tackle disability, \u201cbut there\u2019s not enough,\u201d Munisteri concluded.But for those who can\u2019t find representation in comics, conventions are an opportunity to showcase original characters. Alicia, a wheelchair-bound first-time attendee from New York, was cosplaying as her own character: Alexia the fairy demon. \u201cShe\u2019s the savior of man. She\u2019s in a world where people are different,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe has to be one to help save them before darkness invades everything.\u201d Alicia\u2019s first experience cosplaying at Comic Con was transformative. \u201cIt was liberating. Cosplaying allows me to be more creatively confident. Here, you get to see all types of people, so it lets you be more comfortable with just being yourself.\u201dDisabled cosplayers still have their struggles. The most common complaint at NYCC was the difficulty in simply getting around the convention floor. Eilzabeth Osterman, a Boruto cosplayer from California, said both crowd flow and the materials used on the convention center floor posed problems for her, given her use of a walker. \u201cThey need to figure out a way to move people along better, and the aisles need to be bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for my wheels to get around on certain textures, so carpeting would be a lot better.\u201d The issue of improved accessibility came up multiple times during the convention. During the cosplay panel\u2019s audience questions segment, a physical education teacher from the Bronx took a moment to specifically call out the carpeting as a problem that needed to be addressed. \u201dFor those of us who can walk, it\u2019s not an issue. For someone in a motorized chair, it\u2019s less of an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for someone in a manual chair, it\u2019s a huge issue.\u201d A better alternative, he suggested, would be hard rubberized flooring that could provide better traction for visitors in wheelchairs.A physical education teacher from the Bronx interjected to relay his concerns about the convention floor.The key to getting a response from organizers, according to advocates like Munisteri, is being vocal about the community\u2019s needs. As an example, he cited the \u201cquiet room\u201d that the convention offers for attendees who may find the sensory overload of a convention floor too much to handle. \u201cLast year, we mentioned putting pillows into a quiet room, and this year I walked in, and guess what, there were big pillows there,\u201d he said. He encouraged the physical education teacher to direct his suggestions about carpeting to the NYCC organizers themselves.But while Comic Con works on those logistical aspects, the cosplay community is growing stronger every day, as an inclusive, accessible place for people to be themselves, with the focus on their creativity instead of on their conditions. As Cohen put it, \u201cWhen you\u2019re cosplaying, you\u2019re just relaxed, because you\u2019re in your environment, and you don\u2019t feel like an outsider. Being around likeminded people helps also, because they don\u2019t judge you. People that love you are not going to judge you, and that\u2019s why we cosplay.\" Grid ViewJayden cosplaying as the red Power Ranger, and his family from New York cosplaying as their own characters.Elizabeth Osterman from California cosplaying as Boruto.Alicia from New York cosplaying as her own character, Alexia the demon fairy.A creative take on Harley Quinn.Photography by Zainab Hasnain / The Verge "}
