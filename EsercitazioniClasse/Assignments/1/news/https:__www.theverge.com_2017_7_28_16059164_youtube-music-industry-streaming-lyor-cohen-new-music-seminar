{"title": "YouTube wants to fix its awkward relationship with the music industry", "content": " \nFor the past few years, the biggest fight in the music industry has been against ad-supported music. Apple attempted to kill Spotify's free tier before it launched Apple Music; the industry has railed against what it perceives as low payments from YouTube for years; and SoundCloud, one of the most popular ad-supported streaming sites in the world, is on the brink of collapse. But the truth is that ad-supported streaming isn't going anywhere. YouTube is too big to fail at this point, and labels have largely come to terms with Spotify\u2019s free tier due to its high conversion rate. Getting to scale, everyone acknowledges, requires bringing in users who might not pay at first. \nSo how will it coexist in a music industry increasingly dominated by paid streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music? Executives from Warner Music, YouTube, SoundExchange, Pandora, and iHeartMedia sat down for a panel at the New Music Seminar in New York on Wednesday night. The event was moderated by Tom Silverman, the founder and chairman of Tommy Boy Records and the founder of the New Music Seminar. The group discussed why ad revenues aren\u2019t growing as fast as expected, the benefits of ad-supported services, and why the music industry should be more supportive of streaming services.\nStreaming now brings in the majority of revenue for the music industry\n\u201cIt takes time,\u201d Lyor Cohen, YouTube\u2019s head of music said, when Silverman asked why YouTube isn\u2019t monetizing its ads at a higher rate. Last year, ad-supported streaming like YouTube and SoundCloud\u2019s free service brought in $469 million in revenue for the music industry, according to the RIAA. Paid streaming services pulled in $2.47 billion. Cohen pointed toward the slow adoption of hip-hop within the music industry in the \u201880s \u2014 he was president of Def Jam Records in the late \u201880s \u2014 as a correlation to what\u2019s going on now with advertisers and streaming music.\n\u201cI remember there was at least seven years of incubation for Russell [Simmons], Rick [Rubin], and myself at CBS. Rap music was exploding, the supply outpaced the demand, and it was happening all over the city. CBS was a New York-based company, and all they had to do was drive about 60 blocks and realize how many kids were trying to get into a venue, and they would\u2019ve said, \u2018Oh my god, this stuff is really incredible and special. Let\u2019s invest in it.\u2019 They didn\u2019t invest in it.\u201d Cohen said CBS didn\u2019t catch on to what was happening in hip-hop until the son of then-Columbia Records president Donnie Ienner wanted to go to a Public Enemy concert instead of a Bruce Springsteen show that the label finally woke up.\nStreaming now brings in the majority of revenue for the music industry. In 2016, ad-supported streaming grew 26 percent from the previous year, while paid streaming grew 95 percent year over year. \n\u201cLook at what's happening with SoundCloud.\u201d\nCohen also noted that the music industry needs to forge better relationships with streaming services in order to build better products, instead of just signing over licensing deals and leaving everything up to the tech companies. He pointed toward SoundCloud as an example of where collaboration could have helped. \n\u201cWe're scared to death and we typically stomp them out,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cLook at what's happening with SoundCloud. What a sad experience that they're experiencing right now. To me, we needed to collaborate with them in order for them to help build a business, whether it's an advertising business or an opportunity for them to shepherd their consumers to a potential subscription.\u201d \nThe longtime music executive went on to note that YouTube is working on combining YouTube Red with Google Play Music to give users a single offering \u2014 which, given his statements during the evening, the music industry may have a hand in shaping more than ever before (if Cohen gets his way). \nAs talks shifted to whether ad-supported services help or hurt paid streaming services, Warner Music\u2019s chief digital officer Ole Obermann noted that ad-supported services are so good that there may not be enough incentive to upgrade to paid services, a point that was echoed by Mark Eisenberg, SoundExchange\u2019s senior vice president of strategic initiatives.\n\u201cSome people will never pay for a subscription for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\u201cI think ad-supported and paid streaming are complimentary, and they will always exist together,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cSome people will never pay for a subscription for a variety of reasons, but it doesn't mean that [streaming services aren\u2019t] monetizing them. We just have to figure out a way to make an ecosystem work for all. I think the difficulty is segmentation. If you\u2019re offering the exact same product and features and experience \u2014 paid or ad-supported \u2014 I think some will go to the lower-cost consumer product. So you have to do that differentiation, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done yet in the industry. I think we\u2019re starting to get there, in terms of segmentation of catalog, feature sets, and mobility.\u201d\nStreaming services like Spotify would point out that its free product has been quite limiting, with users only being able to listen to music on shuffle, and now that it nearly has its label deals wrapped up, artists and labels will also have the ability to limit new releases to the premium tier for up to two weeks, giving them more flexibility and control.\nBut even if ad-supported services do everything the music industry wants, it would still be incredibly difficult to close the revenue gap on paid streaming, which grew 95 percent year over year. So how do they increase their value? According to Cohen, YouTube will use its machine learning capabilities \u2014 which Cohen says drives 80 percent of watch time on the platform \u2014 to help break new artists. \u201cYouTube is not only going to build a fabulous subscription business to complement its advertising business, but it's going to work with the industry to help break their acts.\u201d\nDistribution, in other words, is a carrot YouTube is holding out during these negotiations, something beyond revenue that tech platforms might provide to their partners in the music industry. For now, however, YouTube still has a long way to go before it gets to a place where it can shift its negative reputation in the music industry into a positive one.\n\n"}
