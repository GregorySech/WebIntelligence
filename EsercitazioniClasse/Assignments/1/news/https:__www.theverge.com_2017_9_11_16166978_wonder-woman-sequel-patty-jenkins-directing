{"title": "Patty Jenkins is officially directing Wonder Woman 2", "content": " \nPatty Jenkins has officially signed on to direct the Wonder Woman sequel, Variety reports.\nWarner Bros. first announced Wonder Woman 2 earlier this summer at San Diego Comic-Con, and confirmed soon after that Gal Gadot would return to play Diana Prince / Wonder Woman. At the time, Jenkins had only signed on to direct the first film, and since then she\u2019s reportedly been negotiating with the studio over her pay. The delay came down to Jenkins\u2019 expectation that she be paid \u201csubstantially more\u201d than she was the first time around, according to Deadline.\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise: Wonder Woman became the highest-grossing, live-action film directed by a woman, ever, which undoubtably gave Jenkins an edge at the negotiating table.  \nJenkins is reportedly working on the film script with Geoff Johns, president of DC Comics. Though not much is known about the sequel\u2019s plot, Warner Bros. Pictures Group president Toby Emmerich told Variety the movie would take place \u201csomewhere between 1917 and 2017.\u201d\nThe sequel is set to premiere on December 13th, 2019.\n"}
