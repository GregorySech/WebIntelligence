{"title": "Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 and BlackBerry KeyOne go on sale today", "content": " \nThe unlocked versions of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are available starting today at Best Buy retail stores. The S8 is $724.99 and the S8 Plus is $824.99. Both are also being sold directly by Samsung, but Best Buy is probably your fastest bet if you didn\u2019t pre-order; quite a few stores here in New York are already stocking the unlocked devices. The unlocked Galaxy S8 is compatible with all four major networks in the US, as it offers the necessary support for both GSM and CDMA bands. \nBuying the unlocked Galaxy S8 makes sense if you really hate carrier bloat, but you might be waiting a long time for software updates. Last year\u2019s unlocked Galaxy S7 was updated at a snail\u2019s pace compared to carrier versions of the phone, which received new software features (and Android Nougat) months before the unlocked model. \nDon\u2019t expect timely software updates on the unlocked Galaxy S8\nAnother unlocked phone release today is the BlackBerry KeyOne, which you can purchase from either Amazon or Best Buy for $549.99. Just be careful about which model you buy, as the TCL-made BlackBerry comes in two configurations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\nThe one sold at Best Buy stores (and also Amazon) works on GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. But if you\u2019re on Verizon, only Amazon is carrying the model \u201coptimized\u201d for that network. I can\u2019t find the Amazon listing just yet, and I\u2019m not clear on whether that one is also compatible with GSM networks, so I\u2019ve asked TCL for clarification. It sure would\u2019ve made things simpler for buyers if TCL had shipped a phone that works on any network. Sprint will be adding the KeyOne to its phone portfolio at some point. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nBlackBerry KeyOne review: part productivity, part nostalgia\n\nThe KeyOne is a solid Android smartphone \u2014 especially if a physical keyboard appeals to you. But that keyboard leads to sacrifices elsewhere. Namely, the display is smaller than what you might be used to. But it\u2019s a reliable smartphone with excellent battery life. And that keyboard opens up a ton of personalization options. \nPlanning on getting either one?\n"}
