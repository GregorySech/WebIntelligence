{"title": "Belle is Bad and Boujee in this Beauty and the Beast parody", "content": " \nEver since Donald Glover shouted out Migos\u2019 \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d at the Golden Globes earlier this year, the song has topped charts and become an early contender for hit of 2017. That means it\u2019s gonna be parodied, and with Disney\u2019s live-action Beauty and the Beast remake hitting theaters soon, a mash-up was in order. Nerdist went all out for this video, and seeing Belle dab with her friends made my day.\nConsidering the film is only getting mildly positive reviews, I can say that reviving the classic has at least managed to encourage a creative send up or two. Beauty and the Beast debuts this Friday.\n"}
