{"title": "Fans created an animated Game of Thrones prequel to get HBO's attention", "content": " \nGame of Thrones is gearing up for its seventh season, which is set to debut in just a matter of days. With the new season comes the knowledge that the show is swiftly coming to an end \u2014 and that HBO is hard at work on follow-ups that capture its spirit. There are a handful of projects that are being worked on, but we don\u2019t know which one(s) will see the light of day. However, a fan-made pilot set 400 years before the series is where the network should really consider taking things.\nA series about Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s ancestors\n\u201cDoom of Valyria\u201d is an animated pilot specifically created to get HBO\u2019s attention. It follows characters in the Freehold of Valyria, the ancient civilization where Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s ancestors hail from, right before its collapse. Taking place centuries before Game of Thrones, we get to see what life among the dragonlords was like. (It turns out, it was just as dramatic and incestuous as anything in the TV show!)\nThe pilot is the work of YouTube\u2019s Patrick McCarthy, the animator behind the Family Guy parody series \u201cStewie Potter.\u201d \u201cDoom of Valyria\u201d took two years to complete, and it shows, from the style to the research pulled from A Song of Ice and Fire and The World of Ice and Fire. It\u2019s hard to imagine HBO going out of its way to buy this effort, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the period around the Doom is rich and full of potential stories. It would honestly be great to see something like this adapted into a live-action series.\n"}
