{"title": "EU says it\u2019ll pass online hate speech laws if Facebook, Google, and others don\u2019t crack down", "content": " \nThe European Union is once again asking Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other web companies to crack down on hate speech and speech inciting violence and terrorism \u2014 but this time, it\u2019s taking things a step further. The European Commission has issued guidelines for web companies to follow, and it\u2019s warning the companies that, if they don\u2019t comply, the Commission may pass legislation. And that legislation, of course, could lead to some huge fines.\nThere are a handful of guidelines so far. The Commission recommends that web companies appoint a dedicated point of contact, who law enforcement can contact when illegal content is discovered. It wants web companies to allow third-party \u201ctrusted flaggers\u201d with \u201cspecific expertise in identifying illegal content\u201d to come in and monitor potentially illegal posts. And it asks web companies to invest in technologies that can automatically detect potentially illegal posts and speech.\nEurope has already been working with tech companies to combat hate speech\nThe Commission would also like companies to do more to prevent illegal content from being reposted after it\u2019s been taken down. And the Commission says time frames may need to be established for how quickly illegal content is taken down once it\u2019s discovered. Web companies should issue public guidelines, the Commission says, so that users know how takedown requests are treated and what kind of content gets removed.\nIt sounds like a lot, but it mostly boils down to this: web companies should remove illegal content faster and invest in tools and employees to make it happen.\nWeb companies still take over a week to remove illegal content in more than a quarter of cases, says Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for the digital economy and society. \u201cThe situation is not sustainable,\u201d Gabriel says in a statement. \u201cToday we provide a clear signal to platforms to act more responsibly.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a good chance web companies will take steps toward following what the European Commission suggests. For one, the European Union is known for levying enormous fines on tech companies \u2014 like the \u20ac2.4 billion fine on Google \u2014 and those companies would certainly like to avoid any new legislation coming down that they could one day be in violation of. But also, these companies have already been working with the EU toward reducing hate speech. And several European countries have already passed or considered passing their own laws on hate speech that web companies have to comply with.\nA year ago, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft all agreed to hate speech rules, which required the companies to review \u201cthe majority of\u201d hateful content within 24 hours of becoming aware of it. As a result of the partnership, the companies later teamed up on a new database of images and videos identified as promoting terrorism, helping the platforms quickly pull down content that had already been identified as illegal by another company.\nIn today\u2019s announcement, Vera Jourov\u00e1, commissioner for justice and consumers, refers back to that agreement saying it\u2019s proof that asking web companies to more strictly regulate hate speech on their own can work. \u201cThe code of conduct I agreed with Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft shows that a self-regulatory approach can serve as a good example and can lead to results,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. But she also warned that \u201cif the tech companies don't deliver, we will do it.\"\nThe Commission says it plans to \u201ccarefully\u201d monitor web companies\u2019 progress in implementing these recommendations and assess whether further action needs to be taken. That\u2019s supposed to be completed by next May. \u201cFollow-up initiatives will depend on the online platforms' actions to proactively implement the guidelines,\u201d the Commission writes. Further actions, the announcement says, include \u201cpossible legislative measures to complement the existing regulatory framework.\"\n"}
