{"content": " Motorola just announced a new Moto Mod for its Moto Z phones: a $150 speaker attachment with Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant. Officially called the Moto Smart Speaker with Amazon Alexa, the new modular attachment is more or less what you\u2019d get if you took the existing Soundboost 2 speaker mod and built in Alexa. There\u2019s even a giant, glowing blue LED ring on the back, just like you\u2019d get on an actual Echo device. Now, turning a phone into a mini Echo isn\u2019t really a bad thing, per se, but it is kind of a weird product, seeing as any phone that you\u2019d attach the Mod to would already have Google Assistant available for free. If you simply must have an Amazon Echo, the $149.99 that Moto is charging for the Alexa Smart Speaker Mod could get you both a $99 Amazon Echo and an Echo Dot  or an Echo Plus or an Echo Spot  for the same price. Any phone that you\u2019d attach the mod to would already have Google Assistant The only real market I can imagine for this is someone who is so deeply committed to the Alexa ecosystem that they want to have an Echo assistant with cellular data that they can take anywhere, who also has a Moto Z smartphone that they wouldn\u2019t mind some better speakers on. And hey, if you fit into that  possibly imaginary  demographic? You\u2019ll be able to pick one up sometime in November from the usual batch of major electronic retailers  including Best Buy, Amazon, and of course, Motorola . Alternatively, Motorola also announced that the Moto X4 \u2014 which has Alexa directly integrated into the device \u2014 will be available for preorder in the US on October 19th; the phone is set to go on sale on the 26th for $399.99. Motorola will also be selling the X4 in a cheaper \u201cPrime Exclusive\u201d variant, which will include lock screen adds for $70 less.
