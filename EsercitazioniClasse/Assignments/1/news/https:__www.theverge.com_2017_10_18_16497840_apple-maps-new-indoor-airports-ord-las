{"title": "Apple adds more indoor airport maps including Chicago and Las Vegas", "content": " \nApple Maps on iOS 11 now features indoor maps for a few more airports around the United States. Ars Technica reports that Apple has very recently added interior layouts for a handful of locations including Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International and Midway International, plus Las Vegas's McCarran International airport. Baltimore\u2013Washington International, Miami International, Minneapolis-St. Paul International, Oakland International, and Portland International are also now available if you\u2019re running iOS 11.\nIndoor maps were announced as a new iOS 11 feature at WWDC 2017. Apple wants to give users a detailed look at shopping malls and airports around the world so that it\u2019s easier to find food and other pre-flight areas of interest near your gate. \nPhiladelphia International and San Jose International were the first two airports with indoor maps, and Apple still has a fairly lengthy list to check off to make good on what it promised at WWDC. Airports due to be added to Apple Maps on iOS include: Amsterdam (AMS), Berlin (TXL, SXF), Denver (DEN), Detroit (DTW), Doha (DOH), Dubai (DXB), Geneva (GVA), Hong Kong (HKG), Houston (HOU, IAH), Indianapolis (IND), Jacksonville (JAX), London (LHR, LGW), Los Angeles (LAX, SNA), Nashville (BNA), New York (JFK, LGA), Newark (EWR), Pittsburgh (PIT), San Diego (SAN), Seattle (SEA), Toronto (YYZ), Vancouver (YVR). \n"}
