The official blog post mentions that Lexar will continue to offer support for the transition, so you\u2019re covered for now when it comes to whatever flash storage-related woes you encounter.\nIn the meantime, there\u2019s always SanDisk, Transcend, Kingston, and more. Maybe that\u2019s why Lexar is calling it quits. \n"}
