{"title": "FCC chairman Ajit Pai has more broadband choices at home than most Americans", "content": " \nAt his home in a Virginia suburb of Washington, DC, FCC chairman Ajit Pai enjoys something most Americans don\u2019t: a choice in who delivers high-speed internet. Pai\u2019s address is serviced by both Comcast and Verizon, with Xfinity download speeds up to 200Mbps, and Fios speeds up to 500Mbps. Verizon\u2019s packages even include rare synchronous download / upload speeds, instead of the crippled upload speeds most ISPs force on their customers. \nSo it\u2019s a shame the FCC\u2019s message on competition has been broken since Pai took over as chairman. In a Washington Post op-ed today, the chairs of the FCC and FTC joined forces to defend the ISP data-sharing bill, and ended up making the absurd analogy that Verizon can\u2019t be a monopoly because it has less broadband market share than Google does in search engines. The FCC did not give a comment on this story. \nLet\u2019s check the internet competition scoreboard from the commission\u2019s latest broadband report: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCC Internet Access Services report (December  2015).\n\n\nAmerica is a still in a desert of competition for internet access. \nThe key column in this chart is the 25Mbps section, since no serious person thinks 3\u201310Mbps is \u201chigh-speed\u201d anything. Indeed, that\u2019s why the FCC changed the definition of broadband to connections with download speeds of 25Mbps and above in 2015 \u2014 the same year this report came out. And using that bar, roughly 78 percent of Americans have either no high-speed access or just one provider. Chairman Pai lives in the lush green zone at the top right of this chart, where there\u2019s competition between ISPs offering truly high-speed internet. \nAn oasis of broadband choice in the US is just having a choice to make at all. Of course, in the temperate suburbs of DC, oasis might not be the right word. Maybe it\u2019s more like a swamp. \n\n"}
