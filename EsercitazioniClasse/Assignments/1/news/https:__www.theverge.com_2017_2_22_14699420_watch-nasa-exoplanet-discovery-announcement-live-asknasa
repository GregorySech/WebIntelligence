{"title": "Watch NASA\u2019s big exoplanet discovery announcement", "content": " \nAt 1PM ET, NASA will be announcing a new exciting discovery about planets that orbit stars outside our Solar System. The space agency will have a number of panelists on hand for the announcement, including Sean Carey \u2014 the manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech \u2014 and Sara Seager \u2014 a notable expert in the study of exoplanets from MIT.\nPeople are encouraged to ask questions to the panelists through Twitter, using the hashtag #askNASA, and if you have even more questions once the announcement is over, there will be a followup Reddit AMA at 3PM ET. We can answer one question for you now though: it\u2019s not aliens. (It never is.) Still, the discovery promises to be super cool and could help with our search for extraterrestrial life moving forward.\n"}
