{"title": "YouTube TV fleshes out its lineup with AMC, BBC America, and more", "content": " \nYouTube\u2019s streaming TV service is adding several new channels today, including AMC, BBC America, IFC, Sundance TV, and WE TV. Some of those are pretty big names, so today\u2019s addition goes a long way toward fleshing out YouTube TV\u2019s offerings and making it a much more viable alternative to a traditional cable package.\n9to5Google first spotted today\u2019s additions. Telemundo and Universo also appear to have been added about two weeks ago.\nNone of this is a surprise, though. At launch, YouTube said that all of these channels were coming, as well as a few others like ESPN3, but there wasn\u2019t a date for when any of them would arrive. With today\u2019s channel update, the biggest pending names are now live \u2014 so YouTube TV subscribers are good to catch up on The Walking Dead and Doctor Who.\n"}
