{"title": "Waymo vs. Uber: unsealed court documents reveal damning evidence", "content": " \nThe due diligence report that Uber fought so hard to keep from being used in its legal battle with Waymo and Alphabet was made public on Monday \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why Uber resisted as hard as it did. The document, prepared by cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg as part of Uber\u2019s acquisition of self-driving trucking startup Otto, describes a thorough forensic review of personal devices belonging to five people at Otto, including the much-embattled Anthony Levandowski, who earlier this year attempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents in the case. \nThe report paints a picture of executives and lawyers trying to rein in improbably risky behavior at Uber and Otto, two wildly undisciplined companies, even as other top executives egged it on. At this point it\u2019s not terribly surprising that the summary report of the investigation \u2014 apparently codenamed \u201cProject Unicorn\u201d by Stroz Friedberg \u2014 casts Levandowski and Uber\u2019s then-CEO Travis Kalanick in a particularly bad light. But the report also has damning things to say about Levandowski\u2019s cofounders, Lior Ron and Don Burnette, as well as other employees at Otto, including, of all people, the head of Human Resources. \nThe report describes, for instance, employees caught in lies in their interviews with Stroz investigators; an elaborate saga around the surreptitious destruction of five disks of confidential information belonging to Google; furtive text messages advising each other to delete message logs; and search engine queries regarding \u201chow to secretly delete files mac\u201d or \u201ccan a MacBook be recovered after formatting the OS.\u201d  \nThe story takes a bizarre twist\nThe report does say that Stroz Friedberg \u201cdiscovered no evidence\u201d that Google confidential information retained by or accessed by Levandowski was transferred to Ottomotto (the full name of self-driving truck startup Otto) or anyone else. Based on the report, at least, it\u2019s clear that Levandowski and others retained or accessed Google information when they shouldn\u2019t have, but it\u2019s not at all clear whether they actually used any of it. That could prove devastating to Alphabet\u2019s case against Uber. The judge himself told lawyers in July, \u201cIf you can\u2019t prove that Uber got these trade secrets, then maybe you\u2019re in a world of trouble.\u201d  \nThe Stroz report does describe a fair amount of suspicious, cagey behavior on the part of the employees they were tasked with investigating. The firm flagged several contradictions between the interviews and the results of their forensic analyses, even throwing shade at Levandowski\u2019s narration of events. \u201cIt is difficult to believe that Levandowski was not, prior to his interview, fully aware of the extent of the data that he had retained,\u201d the report remarks. \nStroz Friedberg describes Levandowski\u2019s discovery of five Drobo disks (a type of networked storage) of Google proprietary information in his closet, a few weeks after leaving Google. The disks included \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars.\u201d Levandowski told investigators that he had created the disks in the ordinary course of business while at Google, and that as soon as he realized he had the disks, he informed his attorney and then informed Uber at a meeting on March 11th, 2016. Cameron Poetzscher, head of corporate development at Uber, told Levandowski to preserve the disks, but Travis Kalanick \u201cwanted nothing to do with the disks\u201d and told him to \u201cdo what he needed to do.\u201d On the same day, Levandowski wrote in a deleted iMessage to an unknown recipient: \u201cI\u2019ll clean that shit out.\u201d \nLevandowski told investigators that he took the disks to a shredding facility in Oakland right after the meeting with Uber. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sean O\u2019Kane / The Verge\n\n\nHere, the story takes a bizarre twist. The investigators visited the shredding facility twice in an effort to confirm Levandowski\u2019s story, but when they showed Levandowski\u2019s picture to employees, no one recognized him. \nLevandowski also claimed that he had paid in cash and had not received a receipt. But the shredding facility told investigators that \u201call destructions are recorded on a triplicate, carbon-copy receipt\u201d with details about date, time, service and payment. Although investigators did find a record of five disks being destroyed and paid for in cash, the shredding happened on an entirely different day in March, and the signature was \u201cillegible.\u201d \nThe investigators could not come to any conclusion as to whether the disks were actually destroyed, whether Levandowski had lied, or why he would have even lied in the first place. \nForensics uncovered several deleted messages regarding deletion or destruction of information. Rhian Morgan, the head of human resources at Otto, texted Levandowski at least three times about shredding or destroying records, including one text that read: \ni\u2019ve been paying for shredding on my card since it\u2019s not technically a business expense for OM. LMK if I should expense it or send you a bill instead ;) \nThe report implies a few times that their subjects purposefully obstructed their investigation. It notes that they could not examine Colin Sebern\u2019s \u2014 the chief operating engineer \u2014 iPhone, because it was encrypted. \u201cDuring his interview, Sebern provided Stroz Friedberg with a list of possible passwords, but none of them worked.\u201d They did examine Sebern\u2019s MacBook Pro, and found that \u201cinterestingly, 57 gigabytes of additional free space\u201d became available right before his interview with Stroz Friedberg. \n\u201cI\u2019ll clean that shit out.\u201d\nSebern was hardly the only one who seemed to have panicked right before the interview. The investigation also found that Lior Ron had deleted a file labeled \u201cChauffer win plan.docx\u201d from his computer shortly before his interview, a move that Stroz drily described as \u201cpoor judgment given the protocol in place.\u201d (Chauffeur was the name of Google X\u2019s self-driving car project, a team that Ron, Levandowski, and many others at Otto came from.)\nLawyers for Alphabet are seeking to push back the trial date and extend discovery based on the new revelations in the Stroz report. But while the report has plenty to say about Otto employees soliciting and recruiting Googlers when they shouldn\u2019t have, it doesn\u2019t have much insight into whether any Google confidential information ended up in Otto\u2019s or Uber\u2019s possession. Ironically, it\u2019s the stonewalling and other evasive behavior by Levandowski and others \u2014 and apparently egged on by Travis Kalanick \u2014 that now gives Alphabet a decent excuse to draw out the legal battle. Whatever Stroz Friedberg couldn\u2019t find out, Alphabet\u2019s legal team is certain to pursue.  \n"}
