{"title": "The five most interesting Oculus games at GDC", "content": " \nFacebook-owned VR company Oculus rode a wave of hype to last year\u2019s Game Developers Conference, where it offered reporters a full day of demos for flagship titles on the Rift and Gear VR virtual reality headsets. The Rift was released shortly after GDC 2016, and while virtual reality is still niche a year later, it\u2019s much more of a known quantity in 2017. We\u2019re much more aware of the limitations that headsets and motion controllers impose on a game, the conventions that work best in them, and the benefits they can bring to the table. Oculus also isn\u2019t trying to set up an entire launch catalog, just a steady enough flow of games to satisfy users through the year. So it\u2019s not totally surprising that this year\u2019s lineup is more understated than the last.\nAltogether, there were around a dozen Oculus-funded games at the showcase, half of which had been previously shown off at Oculus Connect or other events. Notably, some of the Rift\u2019s most promising upcoming titles weren\u2019t there, including horror adventure game Wilson\u2019s Heart and the space game Lone Echo. But Oculus still let us spend time with several projects that we\u2019re looking forward to seeing more of later this year, from survival shooters to rhythm games.\nAugmented Empire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only Gear VR game on this list, Augmented Empire is part of the new slate of titles meant for Samsung\u2019s new handheld controller. That\u2019s good, because I doubt I\u2019d have played something so involved on the existing side-of-the-head trackpad. Augmented Empire is a turn-based tactical role-playing game being developed by Coatsink Software, creators of puzzle game Esper. It\u2019s set in a sort of art deco cyberpunk world that\u2019s reminiscent of Transistor, and while a lot of the combat feels similar to Shadowrun Returns or other turn-based games, it trades a purely statistics-based fighting system for one where players can dodge a hit or make a shot by tapping the controller at the right time.\nI\u2019m not sure that Augmented Empire will end up being distinctive enough to avoid feeling like a made-for-VR copy of existing tactical games. But it could offer a balance of solid narrative and compelling gameplay that mobile VR has had in short supply. Sadly, no release date has been announced. - Adi\nRock Band VR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmonix\u2019s VR reimagining of its popular rhythm series is among one of the most creative ways a traditional video game has been made to work specifically for virtual reality. Instead of forcing you to play a blend of chords and individual notes in a cascading conveyor belt of colored circles, Rock Band VR takes the freestyle mode of Rock Band 4 and turns into an all-around performative exercise, one that\u2019s less about raw skill and more about having fun. \nIt lets you take the lead of how you\u2019d like your guitar playing to sound, with points being awarded for hitting chord changes that all fit neatly within a song\u2019s verses and choruses, which keeps you sounding like you know what you\u2019re doing. Because the playing is more casual, you can take the time to look around at the crowd and enjoy the full effect of playing onstage. \nThere\u2019s no chance you\u2019ll fail a song in Rock Band VR \u2014 only the possibility that you won\u2019t sound as good as you could. There are a number of other elements that make the experience way more fun and engaging than your standard VR game. For instance, in certain modes and with certain songs, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to launch into a guitar solo, where you can sound pretty much virtuosic even when you\u2019re just mashing buttons \u2014 so long as get the rhythm right. So while it\u2019s not necessarily the rhythm game of the past, Rock Ban VR is still a clever departure for the series that nails what it takes to create an immersive, full-body music game that anyone can pick up. - Nick\nMage\u2019s Tale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere hack-and-slash swordplay is a standard combat style for traditional video games, magic is better for virtual reality motion controls, because it can be done without making players move around too much or dealing with the tricky issue of force feedback. Mage\u2019s Tale is an attempt to create a full-fledged Oculus Rift dungeon-crawler around this kind of spellcasting, from Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera developer InExile Entertainment. (Incidentally, it\u2019s also set in the same world as InExile\u2019s action RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale.)\nMage\u2019s Tale promises a lot of things we didn\u2019t have time to fully try out in a half-hour hands-on, including a complex spell-crafting system and a series of dungeons full of hidden secrets. But we\u2019ve seen enough to at least suggest that it might have those things. The crafting options, for example, combine basic elements like fire and lighting with special attributes like multiple or ricocheting missiles, along with things like custom colors or even confetti tones. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll be released, but we\u2019re looking forward to trying more of it later this year. - Adi\nBrass Tactics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable-top strategy games are a popular genre for VR game makers, mostly because they remove all the inherent challenges of making first-person games in which you can\u2019t really move your body. In Brass Tactics, a new medieval-themed multiplayer game from developer Hidden Path Entertainment, you have your standard waist-level battlefield and god\u2019s eye view, like in the VR card game Dragon Front and the top-down tactical shooter Landfall. What makes Brass Tactics special, however, is how you can change the game\u2019s sense of scale on a whim. \nUsing some clever hand motions, you can zoom out to get a full sense of your units on the ground and the bases you\u2019re defending or attacking. You can also use those same motions to get close and personal with clashes on the battlefield. Traversing from one end to the other also works by way of a kind of invisible pulley system, whereby casual flicks of your wrist can send you flying from end of the map to the other. After about 10 minutes into a multiplayer match, you\u2019ll start getting the hang of the game\u2019s somewhat obtuse mechanics. At that point, you can start more aggressively multitasking while the exhilaration of the combat makes you feel seem like a true tactician - Nick\nArktika.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t get to spend as much time with Arktika.1 as I\u2019d have like, but it\u2019s one of the most ambitious Oculus-funded projects: a story-based survival horror shooter from 4A Games, developer of Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light. Like the Metro series, Arktika.1 is set in a post-apocalyptic future Eastern Europe, where your mercenary protagonist is hired to protect a small outpost from both ordinary raiders and cannibalistic \u201cyagas\u201d roaming the frozen rubble. \nInstead of ordinary first-person shooter controls and locomotion, players use Oculus Touch controllers and toggle between \u201ccover\u201d locations marked around the map, while shooting at enemies with a vast array of modifiable sci-fi firearms. (When you\u2019re not doing missions or spray-painting your guns, you can use those virtual hands to throw coffee cups at your unsettlingly intense-looking superior officer. It\u2019s fun!)\nVR shooters are a difficult genre to get right, especially on the Rift, where (unlike on the HTC Vive) 360-degree motion isn\u2019t always possible. But Arktika.1 is starting in a strong position. The game avoids mass waves of baddies in favor of pitched battles with small groups of tough enemies, and the fixed locations make it easier to stay facing mostly forward, as the Rift\u2019s default two-camera setup requires. We\u2019ll see if these design elements are backed up by a strong enough story and environment when the game comes out in the third quarter of 2017.  - Adi\n"}
