The new Surface Pro, announced today, includes what Microsoft describes as the \u201cfastest pen in the world.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s distinguished engineer and co-inventor of Surface, Stevie Bathiche, excitedly revealed the new Surface Pen to me in a recent interview. \u201cWe did a huge step with the pen, a massive step,\u201d claims Bathiche. \u201cI\u2019m so pumped about this.\u201d\nA number of years in the making, the new hardware speeds up the Surface inking experience so there\u2019s no more perceived lag. It also brings a new tilt experience, much like Wacom tablets, that allows designers and creators to angle the pen for shading just like a pencil. \u201cWhat\u2019s so cool about the hardware ink stuff is that our touch controller, that\u2019s custom to us, talks to our new custom silicon, the display accelerator, and sends the pen data ahead of the operating system,\u201d explains Bathiche. \u201cWe actually write directly onto the screen from the pen. Windows now has an API that will talk to our piece of silicon and that will tell our piece of silicon what color and what font to write.\u201d\n\"We have the fastest pen in the world.\"\nThis custom setup means Microsoft can quickly erase, about a 100-millisecond trail of ink, before the rest of the system catches up, so it improves the latency of the pen. \u201cThis is how we\u2019re able to close that gap,\u201d says Bathiche. \u201cWe have the fastest pen in the world.\u201d Pressure-sensitivity levels on the new Surface Pen have increased to 4096, alongside a 12-gram activation force. The new Surface Pen is now double the speed of the previous one, and Microsoft claims it\u2019s \u201ctwice as responsive as the Apple Pencil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the new Surface Pen.\nPhoto by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\n\nThe new Surface Pen supports tilt\nIn my own limited time with the Surface Pen I saw a big improvement. I couldn\u2019t detect any lag, and the tilt action felt very similar to a Wacom pen. I\u2019m not a professional illustrator, so we\u2019ll have to see what creatives think, but Microsoft has definitely improved the pen here. Although it's slightly more refined and lacks the clip at the top, the new Surface Pen is still not fully circular, as it\u2019s designed to magnetically snap onto the side of Surface devices. Some creatives will still dislike the shape of the actual Surface Pen as a result.\nThe new Surface Pen will be backwards compatible with older Surface devices, but that doesn\u2019t mean the new tilt functionality will be available on older devices. Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pro ships with this new support, and Microsoft is planning to add tilt to existing Surface Studio and Surface Book devices later this year.\n"}
