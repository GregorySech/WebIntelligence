{"title": "SNL imagined an Amazon Echo designed for the elderly", "content": " \n\u201cThe latest technology isn\u2019t always easy to use for people of a certain age.\u201d So says the narrator in one of sketches from last night\u2019s Saturday Night Live, which imagined an Amazon Echo speaker designed for the elderly. \nThe sketch runs through a handful of features for the device, Amazon Echo Silver, playing to the usual senior citizen stereotypes. It\u2019s super loud, responds to any name that sounds remotely similar to Alexa, and has an \u201cuh huh\u201d conversation mode for long, rambling conversations. It\u2019s a bit patronizing in its delivery, but there are companies out there working on home assistants specifically for the elderly. \nHowever, SNL does nail the sketch with its closer: the device can be yours for just three easy payments of $9.99. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Saturday Night Live\n\n\n"}
