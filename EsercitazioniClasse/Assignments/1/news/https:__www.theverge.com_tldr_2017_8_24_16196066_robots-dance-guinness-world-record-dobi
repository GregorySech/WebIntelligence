{"title": "These robots have danced their way to a Guinness World Record", "content": " \nIf you thought you were bad at dancing, get ready to feel worse, because 1,069 robots have broken a Guinness World Record set just last year for the \"most robots dancing simultaneously\" in China. The robots are all named Dobi and are made by Chinese company WL Intelligent Technology. Walking, talking, and doing Tai Chi are some of their abilities on top of the synchronized dancing. WL Tech said the team organized the dance off as a way to display the technology of their robots, which were programmed through one group control system. \nThe robots were lined up and performed a dance routine for the record attempt, but some toppled over (under pressure? nervousness?) and so they weren\u2019t included in the final count. Still, they beat the previous record of 1,007 dancing robots by 62, which is pretty impressive in my books. Each robot costs about $230, has 17 joints \u2014 all for move busting, and the cutest dot-matrix LED eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you imagine the possibilities of what robots could be doing instead, it makes it a lot easier to appreciate their simple dance moves.\n"}
