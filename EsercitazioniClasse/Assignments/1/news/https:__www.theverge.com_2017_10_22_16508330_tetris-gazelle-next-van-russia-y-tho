{"title": "You can \u2014 but shouldn\u2019t \u2014 play Tetris right on the dash of this Russian truck", "content": " \nI love Russian automotive culture. When their not using stripped-down Soviet-era cars as curling stones, they\u2019re doing something equally ridiculous like embedding Tetris in the operating systems of their vans. \nTetris, the quintessential Russian video game, is apparently \u2014 and inexplicably \u2014 included as an Easter Egg in some models of the GAZelle Next vans. To play, you need to perform the automotive version of the Konami Code, which is to say click the odometer and clutch a specific number of times while revving the engine. That makes the game appear on the screen behind the steering wheel. Here\u2019s a closer look:\n\nAnd props to Jalopnik for going the extra mile and translating the narration on this video: \n1) Turn the ignition on 2) Start a car 3) Activate the right turn signal for three blinks 4) Two click the trip odometer reset twice (the computer translated this as \u201ctwo times distant,\u201d but this is what I think that means5) Push the clutch five times 6) Rev the engine to 2000 RPM while turning on the left turn indicator\nSadly, the game isn\u2019t installed in every GAZelle: Tetris is set up on the car\u2019s dashboard during the factory check up but only a few vehicles are lucky enough to be sold with the game.\nOf course, most people would prefer to play Tetris on their phones (or their Gameboys), not awkwardly hunched over the steering wheel of a Novgorod-produced medium duty van. Not to mention the dangers posed by distracting oneself with laying bricks when you should be paying attention to the road ahead. Topping out while doing 110 kilometers-per-hour down the federal highway is probably \u201cgame over\u201d in more ways than one. \n"}
