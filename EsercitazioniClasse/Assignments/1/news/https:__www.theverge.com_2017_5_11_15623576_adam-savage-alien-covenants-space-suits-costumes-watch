{"title": "Watch Adam Savage nerd out over Alien: Covenant's space suits", "content": " \nAdam Savage famously loves space suits. In March, he told The Verge that he owns a number of different types that he\u2019s commissioned or built over the years: \u201cThey all kind of satisfy the same thing in me, and it is to create an environment around your body where you are protected. The space suit is the most amazing, because you\u2019re bringing your own mini-Earth with you.\u201d Recently, Savage visited the set of Ridley Scott\u2019s new Alien series movie Alien: Covenant, and nerded out when he got to try on one of the suits used in the film. \nIn a video posted to Savage\u2019s YouTube Channel, Tested, Savage donned parts of the bright yellow EVA suit, marveling at how well he could move: \u201cWhen NASA does this, it costs millions of dollars.\u201d The suit\u2019s designer, Michael Mooney, points out that the bearings and parts of the suit were 3D printed, not only for convenience, but because Scott liked the texture.\nIn the video, Savage also sits down with the film\u2019s costume designer, Janty Yates, who explains that the production didn\u2019t want to reuse the same types of space suits used in Scott\u2019s film Prometheus, but also didn\u2019t want to replicate those seen in Alien. They went back to the drawing board to create two new types of suits: the IVA, used inside the film\u2019s spacecraft, and the EVA suit worn by Danny McBride, which was inspired by underwater suits. \nWhile the IVA suits were reasonably simple to put together. Yates says they\u2019ve gotten extremely good at designing helmets in recent years. The EVA suit was a \u201ctechnological nightmare,\u201d though, requiring the 3D-printed bearings at every point of articulation. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing of extraordinary genius.\u201d\nAlien: Covenant comes out on May 19th.\n"}
