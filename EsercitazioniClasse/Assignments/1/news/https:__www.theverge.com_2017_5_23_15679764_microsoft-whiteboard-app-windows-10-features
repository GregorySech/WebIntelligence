It's an app that's designed for the company's Surface devices, and provides two-way inking for Windows 10. Currently in private preview for Surface Hub devices, the new whiteboard includes collaborative inking, geometry recognition, table conversion, and automatic table shading. It\u2019s really designed to let people share ink across multiple devices, and will be available on all Surface devices later this year.\nAlongside the new Whiteboard app, Microsoft is also making improvements to the inking experience in its Office apps. Pencil texture and new ink effects will be available in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for Office 365 subscribers next month, and Microsoft has also created a digital pencil case that lets you personalize your favorite pens, pencils, and highlighters and sync them to all Windows 10 devices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice will also support the new Surface Pen low-latency and tilt options. This means you\u2019ll be able to adjust the thickness and texture of ink in Office apps just by physically tilting the Surface Pen on the new Surface Pro.  \n"}
