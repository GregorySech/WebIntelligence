{"title": "Watch a new Pixar short set in the Coco universe", "content": " \nDisney just shared a new, unreleased Pixar short on YouTube called Dante\u2019s Lunch... A Short Tail. The story is set in the same universe as Pixar\u2019s upcoming original movie, Coco \u2014 Pixar\u2019s only film currently slated that\u2019s not a sequel. \nFirst spotted by journalist Brendon Connelly, Dante\u2019s Lunch is just a brief, wild tour through Coco\u2019s world, led by a dog (presumably Dante) chasing a bone. It\u2019s likely an attempt to ramp up interest in Coco, although Pixar probably doesn\u2019t need any help with that. Not only is Coco Pixar\u2019s sole currently-announced original, but it\u2019s also the studio\u2019s first to feature an all-Latinx cast.\nStill, even if Dante\u2019s Lunch is basically just a commercial for Coco, it\u2019s a really nice commercial. Watch it above. \nCoco will be out in theaters on November 20th. \n"}
