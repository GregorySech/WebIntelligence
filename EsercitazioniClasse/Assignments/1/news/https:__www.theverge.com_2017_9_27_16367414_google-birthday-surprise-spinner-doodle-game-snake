{"title": "Google celebrates 19th birthday with 19 games from Doodles past", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s latest Doodle for its 19th anniversary is a birthday surprise spinner that takes players back to its most memorable Doodle games. Spin the wheel to play interactive browser games from the past 19 years, like a musical puzzle game celebrating Beethoven\u2019s 245th birthday, or this adorable Magic Cat Academy Halloween game from 2016. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nGoogle has also added a brand-new Snake game to its Search Funbox, which is one of the 19 wheel surprises among other search result games like tic-tac-toe, and an Earth Day quiz. You can play it anytime by searching \u201csnake game,\u201d or just search \u201cGoogle birthday surprise spinner\u201d to give the wheel a spin and try out the other Doodle games.\nThe wheel also includes the 2010 Pac Man browser game, which time management software company RescueTime famously alleged cost the economy $120 million and 4.8 million hours of lost productivity. For the sake of humoring more bad math, I\u2019m going to go ahead and guesstimate that $120 million x 19 games means $2.3 billion of productivity will be lost today. Have fun!\n"}
