{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pen is now available to preorder", "content": " \nPreorders are now open for Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pen, which the company announced last month alongside the new Surface Pro. The pen costs $99.99, and for now, it appears that only the platinum version is available. You can\u2019t click through on the preorder button on the black, blue, or burgundy versions, and Microsoft just says they\u2019re \u201ccoming soon.\u201d The platinum version has a June 15th release date.\nThe new pen speeds up the inking experience to the point that there\u2019s no perceptible lag. It\u2019s double the speed of the previous version, and it can handle tilting, which lets users shade like they would with a pencil. The new pen is compatible with older Surface devices, although tilt won\u2019t work with every gadget. The new Surface Pros support it, and Microsoft plans to add the functionality to existing Surface Studio desktops and Surface Books later this year.\n\n"}
