{"title": "Twitter could learn from this subreddit about adults who don\u2019t understand social media", "content": " \nSpending time on the internet can be draining. But the best remedy for social media blues is built around the very people who don\u2019t understand it: the OldPeopleFacebook subreddit, aka Cracker Bargel. It\u2019s like dunking my brain into a warm bath. The comments are so nice it would be suspicious, if the posts in question weren\u2019t so earnest.\nThis subreddit provides a beautiful roadmap for how to create a better internet through playful discussion of clueless subjects. Members submit Facebook posts, text messages, and other examples of confused parents or befuddled neighbors. You know the culprits: moms who mysteriously write in all caps; dads who text cringeworthy dad jokes; grown-ups who struggle with the art of the selfie.\n\n\n\"What is meme?\" from\n      oldpeoplefacebook\n\n\n\nThe subreddit could easily devolve intro a cruel stand-up routine, with members laughing at the subjects of each post. But the comments are, shockingly, good spirited. That selfie post I mentioned earlier? \u201cIt's gotta be scary growing up with typewriters and the Sunday paper and ending up old yet making a foray into selfies and social media,\u201d wrote one user in a sweet and insightful top comment. \nOldPeopleFacebook is guided by an excellent set of rules that define the subreddit\u2019s tone. In addition to the basics, like making sure your post actually demonstrates a cluelessness about social media, the community has an expectation of respect. Gentle ribbing is fine, but posters are asked to remove personal information about the people they post. No identifying profile pics or features in photos, no location info, no last names. Any personal attacks lead to bans. \nIt\u2019s hard not to think about how much better real Facebook would be if it applied and enforced rules like these:\nRule 2: Be respectful; this means no personal attacks. Personal attacks will result in a warning, which will then result in a ban.\nOr this:\nRule 4: Submissions must show that the subject doesn't fully understand proper use of social media. While this is broadly defined, it does not include posts that are strictly religious, political, or bigoted. Posts that do not meet this criteria will be removed. \nThe subreddit isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 there are still some icky comments \u2014 but it largely serves as an escape from real social media accounts. There aren\u2019t political scrimmages or anonymous bullies. In fact, the subreddit uses anonymity works to protect the identities of innocent people, rather than allow for cruel and unpunished behavior of any given member. \n\n\nIM URE GRADMA from\n      oldpeoplefacebook\n\n\n\nClear, enforceable guidelines make OldPeopleFacebook a dream to cruise. If only we could convince Twitter to be so thoughtful. \n\n\n"}
