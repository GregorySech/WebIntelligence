{"title": "15 horror movies to stream this Halloween weekend", "content": " \nIt\u2019s Halloween weekend and you\u2019re tired of being outside in whatever thing you made out of tulle and duct tape. The CVS candy sales haven\u2019t even hit yet. What are you supposed to do with yourself until nighttime, when, if you are an adult, you\u2019re allowed to go inside a bar with spooky decor and drink hot cider with rum or something in it? \nHow should you spend the hours until the costume party starts and you have to tape the tulle back on and stick your face in a bucket of water? Is there absolutely anything to do right now, other than search for scary playlists and curl up in a ball and cry and cry and gnaw on a caramel apple until your teeth start to come unstuck from your gums a little bit? \n\n\n    Related\n  \nHold My Hand: the best and weirdest new horror to watch this fall\n\nYes, relax. You can watch a movie. I found some that are available to stream. They\u2019re all \u201chorror\u201d movies, but a few of them are not traditionally scary, out of respect for The Verge readers who have had quite enough of that by this point in October. \nHere they are, and Happy Halloween!\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoadside Attractions\n\n\nTeeth\nThis 2007 Sundance favorite is a new cult classic \u2014 in the way of any movie that gets passed around suburban basements for awhile \u2014 and a dark comedy about a teenage girl (Jess Weixler) who realizes that she has teeth in her vagina. It was written and directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein, Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s son! I recently spoke to Lichtenstein about the film\u2019s upcoming 10th anniversary, and he said Teeth is less a horror movie and more a superhero origin story. It\u2019s true; this film has the story structure of Spider-Man, but instead of super-sticky palms, it\u2019s vagina teeth. \nHow scary: Scarier than Spider-Man, not as scary as James Franco\u2019s performance in Spider-Man 3.\n\nRaw\nFrench director Julia Ducournau\u2019s debut feature, Raw follows a prodigious 16-year-old veterinary student named Justine (Garance Marillier) as she deals with all the standard personal revelations a young woman might have in her first year of college: a fascination with soccer-playing boys, a vague interest in getting hammered and sweaty at dirty underground punk venues, a fondness for shawarma, an insatiable desire to consume human flesh, etc. If you heard whispers about \u201cthe girl cannibal movie\u201d earlier this year and ignored them: you were wrong, and it\u2019s as good a time as any to make things right.\nHow scary: As scary as being 16. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\nGerald\u2019s Game\nA good adaptation of a bad Stephen King novel, Gerald\u2019s Game stars Carla Gugino as Jessie, a woman trying to repair her marriage with a weekend sex trip in a secluded lake house. One thing leads to another, and suddenly she\u2019s hand-cuffed to a bed with her husband\u2019s dead body at her feet, hallucinating and panicking and sifting through memories of childhood trauma in hopes that it will elucidate a way out of her predicament. Fair warning: this movie involves a gruesomely-depicted hand injury that made me want to die.\nIf you like it, you should know that the director, Mike Flanagan, has another horror movie on Netflix right now: home-invasion thriller Hush, which features The Newsroom\u2019s John Gallagher Jr. as a murder guy. It\u2019s pretty good, too. \nHow scary: Scarier than the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s It, but not as scary as the prospect of reading all 1,200 pages of Stephen King\u2019s It.\n\nThe Invitation \nKaryn Kusama\u2019s 2015 SXSW stand-out The Invitation is about what happens when you know something is seriously awry at a dinner party, but you really don\u2019t want to be rude. It stars Logan Marshall-Green as a man invited to dine with his ex-wife and her new husband for the first time, where he\u2019ll also be reuniting with some friends he hasn\u2019t seen in a while and meeting some new weirdos who love a rousing game of truth or dare. That\u2019s all the information you should have, really. The experience of this movie relies on a hazy, paranoid dread, and I won\u2019t ruin it for you. \nHow scary: You will absolutely never go to another dinner party. On the plus side, you\u2019ll also be deterred from agreeing to hang out with someone who broke up with you, which is probably best for your emotional health anyway!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlower Films\n\n\nDonnie Darko\nRichard Kelly\u2019s 2001 box office flop Donnie Darko is so important to me that I am having trouble finding the words to describe it. Last year, Donnie was my Halloween costume. Last year, my coworker Lizzie Plaugic said \u201cI don\u2019t trust people who think that Donnie Darko is formative for them,\u201d and she\u2019s right, you shouldn\u2019t either. You should still watch the movie \u2014 it\u2019s dark, weird, confusing, and looks like a beautiful, brittle painting. It is fun to watch while drunk, and it is most fun to watch while drunk in October. If you\u2019ve already seen it, that\u2019s not really an excuse.\nHow scary: I don\u2019t know... how scary is the idea of dying? How scary is the possible end of the world? How scary are Reagan-era politics? How scary are rabbits?\n\nMother\nOkay, it\u2019s not Mother!, it\u2019s Mother. Just to be clear!\nSouth Korea\u2019s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2010 Oscars, this film from Snowpiercer and Okja director Bong Joon-Ho is about a single mom who makes her living as a rogue, unlicensed acupuncturist. She becomes the self-appointed lead investigator on a murder case when her young son is arrested for allegedly killing a teenage girl and displaying her on a rooftop in the middle of town. Do you like a murder mystery? Do you like helpful context for the director who could potentially win Netflix its first major Oscar this year? Mother is for you, and Mother! is for another time.\nHow scary: Scarier than Mother!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm Futures\n\n\nHellraiser\nClive Barker\u2019s first movie, Hellraiser is based on his novella The Hellbound Heart, and came out in 1987. The timing explains why the special effects are utterly bonkers, and the timing (also the year of Moonstruck and the \u201cyour brain on drugs\u201d PSA campagin) additionally explains why the story is utterly bonkers. It\u2019s about a magical puzzle box that rips all the skin off of a man named Frank, who must later con his ex-lover into seducing and murdering people whose blood he can drink. Later, there are aliens.\nHow scary: Um. \n\nHBO Go\n\nThe Amityville Horror\nHaven\u2019t you ever wanted to see a possessed Ryan Reynolds go absolutely nuts in a haunted house, with an ax? The Amityville Horror was directed by Andrew Douglas, who also directed a few episode of David Fincher\u2019s new Netflix show Mindhunter. It\u2019s a cheesy remake of the 1979 classic, released in 2005, when cheesy was good and Ryan Reynolds was new. There\u2019s a high-stakes library research scene, if you\u2019re into that.\nHow scary: The last time I watched this movie I was in college, and had just eaten an ice cube tray full of Jell-O shots. It was terrifying, if I\u2019m remembering correctly, which \u2014 who knows! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n\nThe Purge: Election Year\nThe third installment in James DeMonaco\u2019s The Purge series came out in the summer of 2016. It follows a Senator (played by Lost\u2019s Elizabeth Mitchell) who wants to end the yearly event in which citizens are permitted to commit crimes up to and including murder. \nAt the time, Emily Yoshida argued that Election Year cemented the Purge series as \u201cthe zombie franchise we deserve,\u201d writing \u201cThe Purge's satire is not of a particularly subtle or sharp variety, but it's deeply effective. From the very start, its true demons have nearly unanimously been moneyed white people. Its the over-the-top depiction of bloodthirsty blondes decked out in Brooks Brothers and Lilly Pulitzer, sharpening their machetes while spouting sanctimonious pseudo-religious nonsense about their rights is absurd and beside the point \u2014 the evils of privilege are the banal kind, after all \u2014 but also darkly cathartic.\u201d \nHow scary: Well, I would say \u201cas scary as US politics,\u201d but that hardly seems funny or true.\n\nThe Ring\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it!\nHow scary:  The scariest movie ever made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick\nThis isn\u2019t really a horror movie, but witches are having a huge year and so is Cher. This is another pick from 1987, a good time for weird Halloween movies. It stars Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer as the titular witches, who live in a beautiful but boring town in Rhode Island and develop a strange relationship with the devil \u2014 played by Jack Nicholson! It\u2019s a campy dream, and Racked\u2019s Meredith Haggerty recently dubbed its costuming and general aesthetic \u201cwall-to-wall vibes.\u201d\nHow scary: It is sort of existentially scary to imagine that a powerful BFF trio wouldn\u2019t consider themselves capable of magic until after they had sex with Jack Nicholson. But in general, this is a comedy.\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nThe Witch\nOne of last year\u2019s best low-budget surprises, The Witch is full of Old English and sinister goats. It\u2019s about a young woman and her creepy family in early colonial America, trapped between the country\u2019s paranoia about witchcraft and the entire world\u2019s basic paranoia about women with strange demeanors or any amount of internal strength. \nOur film editor Tasha Robinson interviewed director Robert Eggers, and he told her \u201cFrom a contemporary perspective, looking back, it's clear that in the early modern period, the evil witch [represents] men's fears and ambivalence and fantasies about female power. And in this super male-dominated society, the evil witch is also women's fears and ambivalence and fantasies and desire about their own power.\u201d Dang.\nHow scary: As scary as being a human woman. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\nPan\u2019s Labyrinth\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s 2006 dark fantasy won the Academy Awards for makeup, cinematography, and art direction, for good reason: It\u2019s a beautiful, twisted fairytale full of deeply messed-up looking monsters. It takes place during the Spanish Civil War and follows a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) as she descends into a labyrinth to save her baby brother. This movie is about children but is not at all appropriate for children, as it features some of the most terrifying creatures committed to film this century. There aren\u2019t any useful metaphors for how scary they are. I have thought about them every day since I was 13. \nDel Toro\u2019s new film, The Shape of Water, is in theaters on December 8th, so it\u2019s a great time to catch up on any landmark works you\u2019ve missed. Conversely, is it ever a great time to watch a guy drink whiskey through a hole in his face? Is it ever a great time for a pasty demon with eyeballs in his hands? Up to you. \nHow scary:  [SCREAMED THIS WHOLE BLURB OUT LOUD WHILE I WAS WRITING IT.]\n\nGreen Room\nJeremy Saulnier\u2019s siege thriller Green Room came out in April 2016, and set up a battle between some punk scene kids and some actual Nazis \u2014 a full nine months before the leftist internet\u2019s schism over whether it was okay and hilarious to punch Richard Spencer in the face on TV. It\u2019s about physically fighting the evil that you\u2019ve spent most of your life just talking about, and in that way, it\u2019s a cathartic fantasy about righteous anger. Also, it stars Patrick Stewart! \nSaulnier told The Verge last year, \u201cViolence for the sake of violence doesn\u2019t sit well with me as an audience member any more. I still like a good makeup show. I like the intensity and the atmosphere of genre films. But I don\u2019t like just waiting for the next kill. I like characters. I like people.\u201d \nHow scary: Not as scary as online discourse, but pretty scary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVCO Embassy Pictures\n\n\nProm Night (1980)\nI\u2019ve only seen the 2008 remake of this movie, starring Pitch Perfect\u2019s Brittany Snow. Assuming the plots are similar, it\u2019s about a young woman who is stalked by a vicious psychopath who is romantically obsessed with her and therefore decides to murder various people in her life. Snow also stars in the god-awful \u201cMost Dangerous Game\u201d inspired horror movie Would You Rather, which is available on Netflix \u2014 her career has been odd? \nI assume it is worth it to revisit the original, if only to show your respect for \u201cfinal girl\u201d icon Jamie Lee Curtis. \nHow scary: The 2008 remake wasn\u2019t scary, but it was very sad. \n\nBonus movie: My coworker Adi Roberston says, \u201cIf you have a library card and are on Kanopy, then you can watch one of the weirdest Italian horror fever dreams ever.\u201d She is talking about Mario Bava\u2019s Lisa and the Devil, which does look weird.\n"}
