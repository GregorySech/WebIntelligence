{"title": "Glow-in-the-dark mushrooms have a newly discovered chemical to thank for their shine", "content": " \nYou\u2019re not tripping \u2014 these mushrooms really do glow. And now, we have a better idea how, thanks to a study published today in the journal Science Advances. \nMore than 100 years ago, a naturalist named George Gardner visited Brazil and saw children playing in the street with what he thought were giant fireflies. They turned out to not be insects, but big, glowing fungi that grow on rotting palm fronds. The species became known as Neonothopanus gardneri. \nRecently, scientists discovered why the mushrooms glow. They planted faux-fungi lit by LEDs in the Brazilian Coconut Forest and saw that the nighttime luminescence attracts beetles, flies, wasps, and ants like, well, moths to a flame (sorry). These insects are key for spreading the mushroom\u2019s spores so the mushroom can reproduce and colonize new food sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green glowing mushroom is the actual mushroom. The rest are artistic depictions of the colors these fungi could glow, based on work published today in Science Advances.\nImage by Cassius V.

The phenomenon, called bioluminescence, has been documented in mushrooms since Aristotle reportedly described glowing, rotting treebark \u2014 called foxfire or cold fire. \nBut how exactly fungi like N. gardneri and foxfire luminesce has been somewhat of a mystery. Often, when a creature like a firefly glows, it\u2019s because of a class of molecules called luciferins. (The name is derived from \"lucifer,\" which is Latin for \"light-bringer.\") They react with oxygen and another reaction-speeding chemical to create a high-energy product that emits light. This light-emitting product is called an oxyluciferin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bucket of Neonothopanus gardneri glows when the lights turn out.\nPhoto by Cassius V. Stevani\n\n\nWhile scientists had recently figured out how luciferin is structured, they hadn\u2019t yet discovered what the light-emitting products looked like. So the researchers collected samples of N. gardneri from the Brazilian Coconut Forest, pulverized them into a slurry rich in the fungus\u2019s reaction-speeding enzyme. \nThen, they used that slurry to produce the light-emitting oxyluciferin in the lab in large enough quantities that the scientists could sketch out the structure for it. Further experiments showed it was possible to create different versions of oxyluciferins that emitted different colors of light by tweaking the structure of the luciferin fuel.\nFluorescent molecules already play an outsized role in biological research: scientists use them to track cells and proteins. This new discovery could produce a new arsenal of luminescent molecules for research. Plus, they\u2019re pretty to look at. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis photo composite shows Neonothopanus gardneri growing at the base of a tree. \nPhoto by Cassius V.
