{"title": "Homeland Security launches internal probe of attempt to unmask anti-Trump tweeter", "content": " \nThe US Department of Homeland Security has launched an internal investigation into an attempt from one of its agencies to unmask the identities of people behind an anti-Trump Twitter account. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the investigation was confirmed in a letter from DHS Homeland Inspector General John Roth to Senator Ron Wyden.\nThe investigation stems from a March 14th summons sent by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to Twitter. The summons requested information that could have been used to identify the operator(s) of @alt_USCIS, a \u201crogue\u201d Twitter account that purported to reflect the views of a dissenting Citizenship and Immigration Services employee. Several rogue Twitter accounts sprang up following this year\u2019s presidential inauguration, with several expressing anti-Trump criticism.\nTwitter challenged the order in a federal lawsuit in April, questioning the Customs agency\u2019s legal authority to request such information. The lawsuit also warned that identifying the user(s) behind @alt_USCIS \u201cwould have a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and on the many other \u2018alternative agency\u2019 accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies.\u201d The DHS rescinded the summons one day after Twitter filed the lawsuit, which was subsequently withdrawn.\nIn his letter to Sen. Wyden, who earlier requested an internal review, Roth said his office is investigating \u201cwhether CBP abused its authority in issuing the March 14, 2017 summons to Twitter.\u201d He added that the investigation will review \u201cpotential broader misuse of summons authority at the Department and/or its components.\u201d\nThe letter also notes that the inspector general\u2019s office \u201chas not played any role in attempting to identify the owner of the @alt_USCIS Twitter account,\u201d and that the internal review would not investigate \u201cany alleged misconduct\u201d on the part of the account\u2019s operators. \u201cWe strive to ensure that our work does not have a chilling effect on individuals\u2019 free speech rights,\u201d Roth said. \n"}
