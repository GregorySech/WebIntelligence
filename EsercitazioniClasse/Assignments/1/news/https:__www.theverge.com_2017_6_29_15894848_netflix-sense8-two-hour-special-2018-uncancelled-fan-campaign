It will air in 2018, as announced through a letter from creator Lana Wachowski on the show\u2019s Facebook page. \n\n\n\nDeath doesn't let you say goodbye. 2 hour finale episode in the works. Tell your cluster.Posted by Sense8 on Thursday, June 29, 2017\n\n\nThe news is particularly unexpected given that Netflix previously posted a response to the multitude of fan campaigns a week after the cancelation apologetically stating, \u201cWe've thought long and hard here at Netflix to try to make it work but unfortunately we can't.\u201d The show was praised for its incredibly diverse cast of characters, but the multiple-location conceit meant that Sense8 was also one of the most expensive shows on television: some estimates were putting it at $9 million per episode, which may have contributed to the cancelation. \nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly has changed in the intervening weeks to bring back Sense8 for a final episode, but fans of the show that were disappointed by season 2\u2019s cliffhanger should at least take solace in the fact that there will be some kind of closure on the series. \n"}
