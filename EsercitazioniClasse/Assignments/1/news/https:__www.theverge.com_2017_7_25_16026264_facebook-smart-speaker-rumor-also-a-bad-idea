{"title": "Facebook\u2019s rumored smart speaker would be DOA", "content": " \nIf Facebook is planning to make a smart speaker, it should really reconsider.\nA report in Digitimes today says that Facebook\u2019s Building 8 research group is developing a smart speaker with a 15-inch touch panel. There are lots of reasons to be skeptical of this: Digitimes has a mixed track record on tech rumors; supply chain sources can misidentify projects or describe early tests that don\u2019t make it to market; Facebook doesn\u2019t have a voice assistant yet; and a 15-inch screen on a speaker seems kind of ridiculous. Asked for comment, a Facebook representative said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to share at this time.\u201d\nAll that being said, it still seems entirely possible that Facebook would want to get in on the smart speaker game. Facebook doesn\u2019t have a role in the smart home yet, despite having its tendrils in so many other facets of our lives. And even though Amazon has a strong early lead, the smart speaker space is really just getting started. Facebook may well think it has something to offer between video chatting, photos, its increasing focus on video, and the huge number of events organized on the platform. It could also give Facebook\u2019s chat AI, known as \u201cM,\u201d another platform to run on.\nPeople don\u2019t trust Facebook\nStill, it\u2019s hard to imagine this going very well. For one, Facebook already has a bad track record with hardware. In 2013, Facebook tried to make a custom Android phone, called the HTC First, designed around the News Feed. The phone itself wasn\u2019t bad (we gave it a 7.9 and commended its 4.3-inch display), but absolutely no one wanted it. It was placed on deep discount just a month later, described as \u201ca disaster\u201d weeks after that, and went off the market a month later. No one wanted to use the device\u2019s Facebook-centric custom home screen on other Android phones either, and it seems to have quietly disappeared the next year.\nThis obviously didn\u2019t happen because people dislike Facebook. More than 2 billion people use Facebook every month, with more than half of them visiting the site every single day.\nBut even though people enjoy visiting Facebook, they still have a big problem with the site: they don\u2019t trust it. It\u2019s seen as too big, too suspicious, too demanding. A recent HuffPost / YouGov poll found that most American adults don\u2019t think they can rely on the company to protect their information. Of the survey\u2019s respondents, 28 percent said they don\u2019t trust Facebook \u201cat all\u201d with their personal data, and 34 percent said they have \u201cnot very much\u201d trust in the company. Another 32 percent said they only \u201csomewhat\u201d trusted Facebook.\nThat survey isn\u2019t alone in those findings. The Daily Dot reported on another poll last year that found almost all American adults are worried about social media sites\u2019 handling of their privacy. In 2013, BuzzFeed News reported on a poll that found that 61 percent of Americans \u201cdo not trust Facebook at all\u201d to protect their personal information.\nVideo producer (and former Verge staffer) Sam Sheffer made this video two years ago about people\u2019s fears (including his own) that Facebook is tapping their phone\u2019s microphone and using what they discuss to target ads. This isn\u2019t at all correct, and is likely near-impossible due to app permissions, but it illustrates the extent to which people are worried about Facebook spying on them.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth asking why people still use Facebook if they feel that way, but I think the answer is probably pretty simple: they\u2019re already doing it, and so is everyone they know. Facebook is helpful for event planning and birthday reminders. But you don\u2019t need to use every aspect of Facebook, and you certainly don\u2019t need to bring a Facebook-made speaker with always-on microphones into your home.\nWhile Facebook\u2019s supposed speaker wouldn\u2019t necessarily be doing anything differently than Amazon, Google, or Apple, it would have far more immense of a privacy hurdle to overcome. Yes, Amazon and Google are trying to target ads to you across the entire internet, and that\u2019s kind of annoying. But neither of them includes the possibility of accidentally posting something to a profile page where hundreds of your friends, relatives, colleagues, and acquaintances will see it.\nI don\u2019t have an extreme distrust of Facebook, but even I\u2019m occasionally worried about accidentally clicking those little blue buttons on websites and spamming my friends. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in that, and when amplified out to an entire gadget that would likely be designed to monitor what you\u2019re saying, that\u2019s a lot to worry about.\nIt\u2019s tough to see Facebook getting past these problems. If the HTC First incident has shown anything, it\u2019s that making a good-enough alternative isn\u2019t enough for Facebook to make a dent. Facebook can certainly draw its users\u2019 attention to new products \u2014 but its users remain hesitant when asked to bring those products physically into their lives.\n"}
