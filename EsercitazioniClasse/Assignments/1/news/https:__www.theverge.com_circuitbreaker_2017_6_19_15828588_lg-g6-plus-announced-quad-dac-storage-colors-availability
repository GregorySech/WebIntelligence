{"title": "LG finally makes a G6 that doesn\u2019t skimp on features", "content": " \nLG has announced a new version of its current G6 flagship phone. The G6 Plus isn\u2019t fundamentally much different to the regular G6, but it comes with 128GB of storage, new \u201coptical marine blue\u201d and \u201coptical terra gold\u201d colors, and the quad DAC only previously found in Asian variants of the phone. It\u2019s also packaged with unspecified \u201cpremium\u201d B&O Play earphones.\nThe quad DAC is a legitimate upgrade to the G6\u2019s audio performance. I\u2019ve been using a Korean model of the phone for a while and it really does sound great, even to these not-especially-audiophilic ears. The question is whether the G6 Plus will represent the first time this capability expands beyond Korea. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nLG G6 review: LG's best phone ever\n\nThe G6 was oddly fragmented between regions, with the US exclusively getting wireless charging at the expense of the quad DAC. LG isn\u2019t saying yet where the G6 Plus will be available, however. Some models will include wireless charging, so it might be reasonable to assume that it should make it to the US.\nFor current G6 owners, LG has also announced a software update with features including facial unlocking, a low power consumption mode, and a warning if you inadvertently cover the camera lens with a finger \u2014 apparently something that can be an issue with the G6\u2019s wide-angle lens. \nThe G6 Plus and the G6 software update will arrive sometime in July.\n"}
