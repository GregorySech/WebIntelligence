{"title": "The 1More Triple Drivers are the best headphones $99 can buy", "content": " \nThe cost of a good pair of headphones has been steadily declining over the past few years, just as we\u2019ve all started spending more on headphones. This apparent contradiction is explained by a shift in expectations: where we previously spent a pittance and expected little, we\u2019re now being more generous in our pursuit of greater convenience and enjoyment, which in turn is stimulating companies to invest in new and more economical ways of making better products. One such company is Shenzhen\u2019s 1More, a three-year-old outfit without a marketing budget or much of a profit margin that hopes to win just by offering superb sound at an unbeatable price. The company\u2019s best known product to date are the 1More Pistons, which Xiaomi licensed and sold at a ridiculous $20 price.\nI have been listening to 1More\u2019s $99\u00a0Triple Driver and $199\u00a0Quad Driver for three months, and I have to say that they are indeed winners. The fidelity and clarity of their sound would justify prices multiple times higher. But it\u2019s more than just technical excellence; these headphones are a downright pleasure to listen to.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s run through the checklist of what makes a pair of in-ear headphones good: a rigid protective case, a wire that doesn\u2019t tangle easily or generate noise by rubbing against your chest, a comfortable fit, and a solid seal to keep your music isolated from the din of the outside world. The Triple Drivers are outstanding in each of those categories, and earn bonus marks for their anodized aluminum construction. The relative bulk of these earphones doesn\u2019t translate to a heavy weight or cumbersome use. On the contrary, inserting and extracting these is as easy a process as any pair of in-ears I\u2019ve ever tried (and by this point I\u2019ve tried a lot).\nGood design should feel obvious, and everything about these earphones feels obvious\nI love the double-stitched faux real leather case. It\u2019s semi-rigid and snaps shut with a magnetic flap. The earphones fit inside it perfectly, neither dancing around in a void of space nor crumpling up into a mess. I still can\u2019t get over how effortless and seemingly obvious the design is with these headphones. It makes me shake my head at all the weird contortions that other headphone companies go to for tailored cases, exotic wires, and awkward earphone shapes. Good design should feel natural and like it couldn\u2019t possibly be any other way, and that\u2019s exactly the high standard that 1More achieves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1More Quad Drivers (top) and Triple Drivers.\n\n\nAll the good ergonomics that I enjoy about the Triple Drivers are also true of the pricier Quad Drivers. The travel case is the same, both pairs come with an abundance of tips (including soft foam ones), and the extra driver doesn\u2019t add anything to the weight. It\u2019s no overstatement to say that I could spend an entire day with either pair of 1Mores in my ears and I wouldn\u2019t feel a moment of discomfort. The Quad Drivers do have a fancier cable \u2014 with oxygen-free copper and a Kevlar core \u2014 but I\u2019m pretty confident that the braided one on the Triple Drivers will last for a long time anyway.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs much as 1More aspires for premium everything, its designs and construction are not without fault. I managed to accidentally unscrew the golden stem on the left Triple Driver earphone, and even though I screwed it back in without a problem, I don\u2019t think that was by design. I\u2019m also not a fan of the plastic remote control since its buttons are hard to distinguish. It\u2019s much nicer on the Quad Drivers model. Neither of them impressed me with their built-in mics, as I had to resolve issues with being heard on the other side of an internet call when using both headphone pairs.\nBut let\u2019s talk about those titular drivers, because that\u2019s where the 1More magic resides. In a fit of self-explanatory candor, the Triple Drivers have two balanced armatures (BAs) and one dynamic driver, and the Quad Drivers have three BAs and one conventional dynamic speaker. 1More is exceptional in designing its own in-house BAs, and the company believes they might be the smallest in the world. Everyone else, even including boutique ultra high-end brands like Noble Audio and the Ultimate Ears Pro in-ear monitors, license BAs from specialist companies like Knowles.\n1More was founded by Gary Hsieh, a Foxconn veteran with experience working on Amazon\u2019s Kindle and Apple\u2019s iPad, so engineering expertise is at the heart of the company. Even so, it\u2019s remarkable to find a new company entering a business as competitive as personal audio with its own custom acoustic architecture and, well, kicking everyone\u2019s butt while doing it. The technical distinction between the Triple and Quad Drivers is that the latter uses diamond-like carbon instead of titanium for its dynamic driver and is essentially overengineering to provide frequency response beyond the stuff audible to the human ear. Both provide exceedingly good sound, though, and ultimately that\u2019s what matters most.\nThe Triple Drivers make listening to music, any music, an extremely enjoyable experience\nThe Triple Drivers are instant crowd-pleasers. Not only are they lovely to wear, but their sound is lusciously enticing. Their bass booms and blooms without ever being too much. Pair them with some appropriately bumping electronic music (like this DJ Jazzy Jeff set) and you\u2019ll be hitting your bliss point in no time at all. The tuning for all 1More headphones is done by Italian music producer Luca Bignardi, who seems to have been the perfect foil for Hsieh\u2019s engineering nous. All I can say as the beneficiary of their hard work on the Triple Drivers is that they make listening to music an extremely enjoyable experience.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Triples being as good as they are, it\u2019s fair to question if there\u2019s any reason for the Quad Drivers to exist at all. I can tell you with certainly that the bigger and badder model is not twice as good. Obviously. But yes, there is a reason and a substantive distinction between the two models, and that\u2019s felt in the high frequencies. The one weakness of the Triple Drivers is that their treble can occasionally sound grainy, and that\u2019s where the Quads come in and smooth everything out.\nThe Quad Drivers can definitely carry the \"reference-class\" label, which audiophiles attach to the headphones that are considered most faithful to the original recording and the artist\u2019s intent. The Triples\u2019 extra warmth isn\u2019t apparent on the Quads, though there\u2019s still a listener-friendly bass bump to the tuning. As 1More puts it, \"flat [frequency response] is good. Flat with a little bit of love is better.\" In short, the Triple Drivers give you more love, while the Quad Drivers offer more precision and refinement.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a danger that, in comparing two exceptional pairs of headphones against one another, I might understate just how excellent both of them are. For $199, the Quad Drivers are a steal, carrying all the hallmarks of luxury headphones, whether you\u2019re looking at performance, ergonomics, design, or convenience. But it\u2019s the $99 Triple Drivers that should have everyone doing a double-take after even a brief listen. Not only are they smartly designed and built for everlasting comfort, but they sound thrillingly good.\nThe common flaw to most of the best headphones I\u2019ve reviewed so far has been a manifest lack of convenience. My current favorite pair is the Audeze LCD-X, which does amazing things with music but is the size and weight of a small house. What makes the 1More Triple and Quad Drivers great is their rare mix of convenience and performance. I went through the rigors of Mobile World Congress with the Quad Drivers in my backpack, leaving Sennheiser\u2019s IE800s at home, because even I\u2019m not crazy enough to risk losing or breaking $800 earphones at a trade show. And the biggest compliment I can give to 1More\u2019s headphones is that when I\u2019m using them I\u2019m not missing any of my home comforts. The Triple and Quad Drivers take great music on the move in an easy and extremely affordable way.\nPhotography by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n"}
