{"title": "Dell updates XPS 13 with 8th generation Intel processors", "content": " \nDell is updating a bunch of its laptops with Intel\u2019s newest processors, the 8th generation Kaby Lake chips. At the top of the list is the XPS 13, which gets the option for two of Intel\u2019s quad-core chips: an i5, running at 1.6GHz with speeds up to 3.4GHz, and an i7, running at 1.8GHz with speeds up to 4GHz.\nThe new processors won\u2019t all be available at once. On September 12th, Dell will phase in the Core i7 chip, then in October, it\u2019ll bring in the i5 chip. Dell didn\u2019t have pricing information available for XPS 13 models with 8th generation processors, but the current i7 sells for $1,349.99, so you can expect it to be somewhere around that.\nNothing changes but the processor\nOther than the new processor options, nothing is changing on the XPS 13, for better or worse. The laptop had one of the most impressive designs when it was introduced in 2015, but it\u2019s now facing much tougher competition as other PC manufacturers have figured out how to make their own laptops with similarly tiny bezels.\nIn addition to the XPS 13 update, Dell is also bringing 8th generation processors to several laptops in its lower-end Inspiron line. That includes 13- and 15-inch models of the Inspiron 5000 2-in-1, the Inspiron 7000 2-in-1, and the standard Inspiron 7000. The 17-inch Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 will get 8th generation chips, too.\nFor these laptops, the 8th generation chips will completely replace the 7th generation options, so they\u2019ll keep their starting prices (between $799 and $949). The Inspiron 5000 2-in-1 is also getting an option for an active stylus. All of those will become available on October 3rd.\nOh, and Dell is also adding this very catchy rose gold option (aka pink) to the Inspiron 7000. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be available in the United States:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n"}
