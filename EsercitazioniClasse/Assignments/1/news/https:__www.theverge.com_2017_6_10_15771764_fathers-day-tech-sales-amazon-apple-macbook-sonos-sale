{"title": "Amazon devices get big discounts for Father\u2019s Day, including the Echo and Kindle", "content": " \nFather\u2019s Day is quickly approaching \u2014 June 18th, to be exact \u2014 so this weekend is a great time to buy something nice for your dad if you haven\u2019t already. We\u2019ve gone through a large number of deals to select the seven best ones for you or your father, including two exclusive to The Verge for a limited time.\nAnnounced this morning, Amazon devices got new discounts for Father\u2019s Day that you\u2019ll definitely want to check out. Also, Microsoft announced yesterday that it is knocking $50 off select bundles ahead of its Scorpio release at E3.\nLet\u2019s not waste anymore time and get straight to the deals:\n\n\nAmazon devices deals: For one week only, get pretty big discounts across Amazon\u2019s best devices (no restrictions apply). Highlights include $40 off the Echo ($139.99), $10 off the Echo Dot ($39.99), $30 off the Tap ($99.99), and $20-$90 off Kindle E-readers. It\u2019s probably worth pointing out that during last Black Friday certain deals were only available if you ordered through Alexa, so you\u2019ll need an Echo or Fire TV device to take advantage of this year\u2019s prime shopping days.\n\nMicrosoft Xbox One S bundles: Lasting only one week, select 500GB bundles are $249 and 1TB bundles are $299. Highlights include Forza Horizon 3, Battlefield 1, Halo Wars 2, and Gears of War 4 (special edition). Update: As of June 11th at 11AM ET, a few of these are priced a bit lower on Amazon including the Gears of War 4 1TB bundle ($281) and Minecraft 500GB bundle (239.99).\n\nSonos Dads and Grads sale: As mentioned last week, get $50 off the two room music system (two Play:1s for $348) and $100 off the SUB, which adds dramatically deeper bass to any Sonos speaker (or amplified component). This sale ends June 18th, or while supplies last, and can also be found on Amazon.\n\nExclusive deal on the Nixplay Seed 10-inch: Verge readers can now take 20 percent off the digital photo frame (with code NIX20OFF) until June 12th at 5PM PDT \u2014 bringing the price down to $136. Nixplay has other Father\u2019s Day promos on their online store, although our favorite is the aforementioned exclusive on Amazon. \n\nExclusive deal on the Portal Wi-Fi Router: Until June 13th, Verge readers can grab 20 percent off the wireless router on Amazon; just make sure to use code VERGEDAD to get it for $118. Although it\u2019s kind of large, the Portal might solve your Wi-Fi problems if you're finding other routers have a lot of interference in your home.\n\n$150 off the 13-inch MacBook Pro (late 2016 model): B&H has last year\u2019s Macbook Pro discounted to $1,349. The new MacBook\u2019s announced at WWDC last week don\u2019t have a huge boost in specs so this is a great discounted option if you or your dad are in need of a new laptop.\n\nFitbit Father\u2019s Day sale: Just like Fitbit offered for Mother\u2019s Day, you can get up to 50 percent off select Fitbits and accessories. Highlights include the Charge 2 for $139.95 and Special Edition Blaze for $179.95.\n\nLooking for gaming deals?
