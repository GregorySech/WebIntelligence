{"title": "The Switch broke Nintendo\u2019s sales records (in the Americas, at least)", "content": " \nThe Nintendo Switch is off to a big start, with sales for Nintendo\u2019s new console beating out first two-day sales in the Americas for any system in Nintendo\u2019s history, according to New York Times reporter Nick Wingfield, who had spoken with Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime. Wingfield noted that the Switch\u2019s success is particularly impressive given that the console launched in March, rather than the more traditional holiday season. \nIt\u2019s an early win for the Switch, especially since Nintendo\u2019s previous record holder for two-day sales was the incredibly popular Wii. While its hard to compare without exact sales numbers, Nintendo announced at the time that the Wii sold over 600,000 units in the first eight days in the Americas, a figure the company would no doubt like to surpass. The Wii would go on to ship over 100 million units, and remains one of the most popular consoles ever shipped. \n\n\n2. Fri-Sat sales for Nintendo Switch exceeded first 2-day sales in Americas for any system in Nintendo history. Next biggest was Wii.\u2014 Nick Wingfield (@nickwingfield) March 6, 2017\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Fils-Aime told Wingfield that the Switch version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the best-selling launch title (that wasn\u2019t bundled, like Wii Sports) of any Nintendo console. It\u2019s another impressive achievement considering the popularity of the Nintendo 64\u2019s launch title, Super Mario 64, and the fact that Breath of the Wild is also available for the Wii U.\nNintendo has yet to reveal actual sales numbers for either the Switch or Zelda at this time. Still, it\u2019s an unqualified good start for the Switch.\n\n\n4. Zelda for Nintendo Switch the best selling standalone launch title (i.e. not a bundled game a la Wii Sports) in Nintendo history...\u2014 Nick Wingfield (@nickwingfield) March 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch hardware review\n\n\n\n\n"}
