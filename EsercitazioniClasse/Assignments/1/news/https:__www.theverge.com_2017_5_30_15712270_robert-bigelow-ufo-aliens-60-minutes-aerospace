{"title": "Space industry CEO is \u2018absolutely convinced\u2019 that aliens have visited Earth", "content": " \nOn Sunday, Robert Bigelow \u2014 real estate mogul and founder of the space habitat company Bigelow Aerospace \u2014 did an interview with 60 Minutes, in which he touted the strengths of the commercial space industry and how private companies would pave the way for people to live in space. He also said aliens have definitely visited Earth.\n\nLara Logan: Do you believe in aliens?\nRobert Bigelow: I'm absolutely convinced. That's all there is to it.\nLara Logan: Do you also believe that UFOs have come to Earth?\nRobert Bigelow: There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence. And I spent millions and millions and millions -- I probably spent more as an individual than anybody else in the United States has ever spent on this subject.  \n\nBigelow told 60 Minutes that he first became interested in aliens after his grandparents had a close encounter with a UFO outside Las Vegas once. \u201cIt really sped up and came right into their face and filled up the entire windshield of the car,\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cAnd it took off at a right angle and shot off into the distance.\u201d \nAdmitting you believe in aliens is one thing, but Bigelow seems to be no less than a true Believer. He told 60 Minutes that he\u2019s also had \u201cclose encounters\u201d but wouldn\u2019t divulge any specifics. And apparently, Bigelow owns a company that has been getting referrals from the FAA about reports of UFOs and other weird activity, 60 Minutes confirmed. In fact, his fascination with aliens is the reason there\u2019s an alien illustration on the side of Bigelow Aerospace\u2019s headquarters in Las Vegas. \nSkeptical? That\u2019s fine. He doesn\u2019t care about the haters. \n\nLara Logan: Is it risky for you to say in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens?\nRobert Bigelow: I don't give a damn. I don't care.\nLara Logan: You don't worry that some people will say, \"Did you hear that guy, he sounds like he's crazy\"?\nRobert Bigelow: I don't care.\nLara Logan: Why not?\nRobert Bigelow: It's not gonna make a difference. It's not gonna change reality of what I know.\nLara Logan: Do you imagine that in our space travels we will encounter other forms of intelligent life?\nRobert Bigelow: You don't have to go anywhere.\nLara Logan: You can find it here? Where exactly?\nRobert Bigelow: It's just like right under people's noses. Oh my gosh. Wow.\n\nTo be fair, if aliens are already living here, I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter if you believe in them or not. They seem to be blending in just fine. Also, Bigelow\u2019s belief doesn\u2019t seem to have detracted much from his success. He told Logan he\u2019s made enough from building long-stay rental apartments to support Bigelow Aerospace, which launched its first inflatable human-rated habitat last year. The module, known as the BEAM, is currently attached to the International Space Station. Meanwhile, Bigelow Aerospace is working toward making an even bigger space station called the B330, which the company wants to send to space as early as 2020. No word yet if aliens are secretly working on the technology.\n\n"}
