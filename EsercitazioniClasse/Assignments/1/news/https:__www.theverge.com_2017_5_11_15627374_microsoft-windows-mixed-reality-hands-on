{"title": "I tried Microsoft\u2019s first Mixed Reality headset and it was just like VR", "content": " \nMicrosoft is planning to introduce a number of what it calls Mixed Reality headsets later this year. While the software maker first unveiled HoloLens as its answer to augmented reality, it has expanded its plans with a larger \u201cMixed Reality\u201d focus. I got a chance at Microsoft\u2019s Build developer conference to try out Acer\u2019s Mixed Reality headset.\nThe hardware itself felt comfortable on my head, and I was able to quickly adjust it for a tighter fit. It didn\u2019t feel particularly heavy, but I only tested an app experience on the headset for around 10 minutes. The gaze support and tracking felt just like any regular VR headset, and it was quick to respond to when I glanced in opposite directions without making me feel sick.\nThe demo experience I tested was a weather map that let you analyze data on wind direction and precipitation. It was fairly basic, but interactive. I could walk around and briefly test the six degrees of freedom which seemed to work well with the sensors built into the device. I used an Xbox One controller to drop pins and interact with the map, but Microsoft is also releasing motion controllers with a round trackpad, analog stick, and menu button. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was most surprised by the actual experience of using this Mixed Reality headset. I was expecting a HoloLens setup, but it\u2019s literally just virtual reality. You lift the visor to see the real world, but there\u2019s no mixed reality here. It\u2019s confusing that Microsoft has opted to call these headsets Mixed Reality. Microsoft has shown demonstrations of where these headsets map real space and putting virtual objects onto pass-through video, but I wasn't able to try this experience.\nI was also unable to test the actual shell and default apps experience in this \u201cMixed Reality\u201d world of Windows. As this is a virtual reality environment, the apps and experiences will differ a little to how HoloLens projects objects into your vision. Microsoft still hasn\u2019t fully detailed how this works, but with headsets shipping over the summer we\u2019ll soon get to experiment with Windows Mixed Reality fully.\n"}
