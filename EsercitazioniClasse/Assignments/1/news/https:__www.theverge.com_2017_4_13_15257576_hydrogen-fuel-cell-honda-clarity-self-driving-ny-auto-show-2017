{"title": "Automakers aren\u2019t thinking creatively enough about hydrogen fuel cells", "content": " \nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, so its appeal to the fossil fuel-addicted auto industry is obvious. But while most car companies think they\u2019ll be able to sell hydrogen fuel cell cars to eco-minded consumers, they are ignoring a glaring opportunity: that hydrogen-powered cars could be the perfect fuel for our self-driving, on-demand future. \nThis week, Honda introduced two new versions of the Clarity: a plug-in hybrid version with an all-electric range of 40 miles, and a battery-powered version, the range of which is undisclosed. Honda says it has close to 100 hydrogen-powered vehicles on the road in California today \u2014 the only state in the US with anything approaching a hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The automaker hopes to eventually sell \u201cthousands\u201d of fuel cell vehicles over the next four years. \nAnd Honda isn\u2019t alone. Hyundai and its sister company Kia both have to plans to introduce fuel cell vehicles in the next three years. Toyota has its Mirai class of fuel cell cars on sale today. GM and Honda recently announced a joint venture where the two automakers hope to produce a next-generation fuel cell system by 2020, while BMW is engaged in a hydrogen R&D partnership with Toyota. \nHoping to buy a fuel cell vehicle outside the Golden State? Fat chance\nHydrogen fuel cells \u2014 which use compressed hydrogen as their fuel and release only water vapor \u2014 have been in development for decades. But only recently have they attained performance and range numbers good enough to replace an average driver's gasoline-powered car. So why aren\u2019t we seeing the same enthusiasm among fans of zero-emissions driving for cars like the Clarity as we are for any of Tesla\u2019s battery-powered electric vehicles? \nThe main reason is that the hydrogen-fueling infrastructure is practically nonexistent. Despite the technology having been in development for decades, there are only a little more than two dozen fueling stations in California, mostly clustered around Los Angeles and the Bay Area. \nThen there\u2019s the increasing competition from battery-powered electric cars. As the cost of batteries drop, some carmakers see fuel cell vehicles as increasingly uncompetitive. Recently, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said that hydrogen fuel cells are no longer a major part of the automaker\u2019s plans for the future. Instead, the Mercedes-Benz parent company said it would be doubling down on electric technology. His comments are already being interpreted as a signal that Daimler will be winding down its participation in a 2013 agreement with Ford and Renault-Nissan to jointly develop fuel cell technology. \nZetsche was much more diplomatic about hydrogen than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has derided the technology as \u201cincredibly dumb,\u201d \u201cextremely silly,\u201d \u201cmind-bogglingly stupid,\u201d and most succinctly, \u201cbullshit.\u201d \n\n\nDriving the 2017 Honda Clarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge\n\n\nHonda gave me the opportunity to drive the 2017 Clarity earlier this week so I could experience a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle firsthand. My first observation was how quiet the car drove. Much like a Tesla or any other battery-powered electric vehicle, the Clarity was a ghost on four wheels, only emitting a soft whine when I would jam the throttle. \nDriving down the narrow, pothole-ridden streets of Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, the Clarity handled itself smoothly. A digital display behind the steering column showed a fully fueled hydrogen tank, easing my dread about running out of power in a city without any refueling stations. And a small blue ball in the center of the screen would grow or shrink, depending on how much electricity was being generated by the car\u2019s fuel cells. \nA heads-up display projected onto the lower left-hand corner of the windshield showed the vehicle\u2019s speed, while an 8-inch touchscreen on the center console offered a range of typical features (navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, etc). Below the screen, a panel of buttons for the car\u2019s main functions \u2014 park, drive, reverse, neutral \u2014 extended out and down like a bridge to connect with the armrest and cupholders. \nAs for the drive itself, it was brief and enjoyable. Press the oddly named \u201cSport\u201d button, and you get enhanced regenerative braking, though not as much as Tesla or BMW. The feel of the vehicle\u2019s interior, with its ultrasuede and faux wood paneling made of recycled material, was both luxurious and eco-friendly. \nThe Honda Clarity offers an EPA-estimated range of 366 miles \u2014 the longest range of any zero-emission vehicle. The vehicle is only available for lease, with pricing starting at $369 per month. There\u2019s a $15,000 fueling allowance from Honda and a $5,000 tax incentive from California. It\u2019s almost enough to make you forget that refueling this car will be a huge pain in the ass.   \n\n\n\u201cHydrogen is an energy storage mechanism. It is not a source of energy. So you have to get that hydrogen from somewhere,\u201d Musk said in 2015. \u201cIf you get that hydrogen from water, so you\u2019re splitting H20, electrolysis is extremely inefficient as an energy process\u2026. If you took a solar panel and use the energy from that to just charge a battery pack directly, compared to trying to split water, take the hydrogen, dump the oxygen, compress the hydrogen to an extremely high pressure (or liquefy it), and then put it in a car and run a fuel cell, it is about half the efficiency. It\u2019s terrible. Why would you do that? It makes no sense.\u201d\nHonda has a much different perspective, obviously. Stephen Ellis, director of fuel cell vehicle marketing for the carmaker\u2019s American division, said that hydrogen\u2019s appeal is its ability to \u201cmimic\u201d the habits of fueling and operating a gas-powered vehicle: a 3- to 5-minute refueling time and a range of up to 366 miles. \u201cThis is a continuum,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe should have multiple choices, fuel cell being one of them.\u201d\nIn response to the criticism that hydrogen is too inefficient and energy intensive to produce, Ellis explained that Honda \u201cwouldn\u2019t be doing this if there was no environmental value.\u201d Most hydrogen in the US is produced via a process called steam-methane reforming, in which steam is heated up to a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius to produce hydrogen from a methane source such as natural gas. But that isn\u2019t the only method available. \n\u201cSome will say, \u2018When you make it from natural gas, it still emits carbon,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cYes, but what we\u2019re looking at is well-to-wheel... [Unlike oil], hydrogen will always be regionally or locally sourced. You can make it from water using zero-carbon electrons \u2014 solar, wind, hydroelectric. You can make it from natural gas. You can make it from biomethane.\u201d\nBut the near-term problem of a lack of fueling locations represents the most significant obstacle to widespread adoption of this technology. Honda and other fuel cell vehicle makers are watching closely to see if any other states get inspired by California\u2019s example and begin building out their hydrogen fueling capacity. \nThe Northeast, and especially New York and Massachusetts, are seen as the next frontier for fuel cell vehicles. New York governor Andrew Cuomo included in the state\u2019s most recent budget $55 million in rebates of up to $2,000 for New York state residents who purchase zero-emission vehicles. Fuel cell advocates are pushing for $15 million of that initiative be put toward funding a hydrogen fueling infrastructure. \nExperts predict that we may see more commercial vehicles, like trucks and forklifts, using hydrogen than mass-market cars. That\u2019s because hydrogen can hardly compete with cheap gas and rapidly improving electric-powered technology to appeal to a mass audience. \u201cFor hydrogen to compete with either fuel source would require a substantial reduction in the cost of fuel cell technology along with the build out of a comprehensive hydrogen fueling network,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cNeither scenario appears likely in the next 10 years, if ever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA hydrogen fueling station in Japan.\n\n\nIn fact, the most logical application of hydrogen is going to be almost completely ignored by major automakers: hydrogen-powered autonomous vehicle fleets operating in high-density, geofenced urban areas. Studies have shown that the charging time required for a battery-electric vehicle in an urban mobility setting, like ride-sharing or car-sharing, will significantly eat into utilization, especially if it has to use Level 2 charging (Level 1 being a standard home outlet). \nWhile Level 3 DC \u201cfast charging,\u201d as represented by Tesla\u2019s Superchargers, would improve this, it would also degrade the batteries and cause infrastructure concerns. Moreover, the space required to park these charging electric vehicles would also negate one of the prime advantages of autonomous on-demand mobility \u2014 that it could free up parking spaces for housing development or parkland. Hydrogen-powered, self-driving vehicles could address many of these barriers. \n\u201cA city would only need a handful of hydrogen stations to support the fleet [of self-driving cars].\u201d\n\u201cA city would only need a handful of hydrogen stations to support the fleet, with vehicles getting in and out within a few minutes and going right back into service,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, senior research analyst at Navigant Research. \u201cThis would give the zero-emissions advantage while minimizing downtime.\u201d\nSteve Center, vice president of Honda\u2019s connected and environmental business development office, said the Clarity could be easily retrofitted into an autonomous vehicle, with its millimeter-wave radar embedded in the lower grille. \u201cYou add a couple more sensing devices and LIDAR and things like that,\u201d Center said. \u201cYou tie them together and you turn them on.\u201d\nThis is not to say that the Clarity is a self-driving car \u2014 far from it, in fact. Honda trails most major automakers in its pursuit of autonomous technology. A recent report by Navigant placed the Japanese company in 15th place out of a total of 18 companies. Honda unveiled its NeuV concept car at CES earlier this year: a tiny, two-seater designed for automated driving and ride-sharing. And even though it was a concept, and technically could embody any vision of the future that Honda desired, the NeuV was a battery-electric vehicle. Hydrogen, it appeared, was too far-fetched for this concept.   \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
