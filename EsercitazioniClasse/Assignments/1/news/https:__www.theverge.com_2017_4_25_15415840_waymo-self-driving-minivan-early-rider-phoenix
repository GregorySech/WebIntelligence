{"title": "Waymo\u2019s self-driving minivans are now offering rides to real people in Arizona", "content": " \nStarting today, residents of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area can sign up to go for a ride in a self-driving minivan. As often as they want. For free. \nWaymo, the self-driving car startup spun off from Google late last year, announced today that it\u2019s offering its services to members of the public for the first time. Waymo is calling it an \u201cearly rider program,\u201d intent on cataloguing how on-demand, driverless cars will factor into people\u2019s everyday lives. Interested participants can sign up on the company\u2019s website, and Waymo will select riders depending on the the types of trips they want to take and their willingness to use the self-driving service as their primary mode of transportation. \nA Waymo test driver will be behind the wheel at all times, but the company insists that the vehicle will drive without human intervention as much as possible. Rides will only be available to residents of Phoenix and the surrounding towns, like Gilbert, Tempe, and Chandler. Waymo describes the service areas as twice the size of San Francisco. \n\u201cwe want to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner\u201d\nIn order to accommodate what it hopes will be \u201chundreds\u201d of riders, Waymo is ordering an additional 500 Chrysler Pacifica minivans from its automaker partner, Fiat Chrysler, which it will then outfit with the laser sensors it manufactures in-house. Waymo already has 100 self-driving minivans that have been driving the streets of Phoenix and Mountain View, California, since earlier this year. \n\u201cWe want as many people as possible to experience our technology, and we want to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner,\u201d said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, in a Medium post published today. \nThis is a major milestone for Google\u2019s parent company, which has been operating self-driving cars on public roads for years without allowing real people to experience the technology first-hand. Its competitors, meanwhile, have been less hesitant. Uber started inviting riders to hail its autonomous cars in Pittsburgh last September, and has since launched an additional limited experiment in Tempe, Arizona. \nBut Uber\u2019s self-driving experiment has been fraught with missteps. A self-driving Uber was involved in an accident a few weeks ago, resulting in the vehicle tipping over on its side. Waymo is now suing Uber, accusing the ride-hail company of stealing some of its self-driving secrets. Uber\u2019s response to the lawsuit basically amounted to a long admission that Google\u2019s technology is far superior to its own. \nWaymo has actually been providing trips to \u201ca handful\u201d of people (contacts of Waymo employees, a spokesperson said) for several months now. Happy with the results, the company decided to open its doors to a wider selection of residents. \nIn his Medium post, Krafcik highlights one Arizona family \u2014 Ted, Candace, and their four kids \u2014 while the company provided glossy photos and b-roll of the smiling family participating part in Waymo\u2019s radical experiment. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy radical? Arizona doesn\u2019t regulate self-driving vehicles as closely as other states like California. As such, Waymo isn\u2019t required to obtain a license or submit any information to regulators regarding its decision to start allowing regular people into its driverless vehicles. A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Transportation was not immediately available for comment. \nEven so, Waymo says it has the tacit approval from the city of Phoenix and the surrounding communities. It\u2019s not hard to believe: after Uber\u2019s self-driving experiment got shut down in San Francisco late last year, the ride-hail company absconded to Arizona, where it was welcomed with open arms by Governor Doug Ducey. The Republican politician was quick to endorse Waymo\u2019s new program too. \n\u201cArizona is proud to be leading the nation as a home for innovation and technology,\u201d Ducey said, in a statement provided by Waymo. \u201cThis latest phase of Waymo\u2019s testing will provide new transportation options for Arizonans who participate, and help pave the way for the expansion of this technology.\" \nLike Uber\u2019s offering, Waymo\u2019s self-driving service will be limited at first. Approved riders will be able to hail a minivan using a Waymo app (a spokesperson declined to share a screenshot or any details about how the app will work). The rides will be free and participants will be asked to share details about when and how they use the service. \n\u201cWe'll learn things like where people want to go in a self-driving car, how they communicate with our vehicles, and what information and controls they want to see inside,\u201d Krafcik said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate April 25th, 2017, 12:33 PM ET: A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Transportation sent the following statement:\nThe very nature of transportation is changing rapidly. In a few years \u2013 perhaps sooner than we realize \u2013 many vehicles will be using technologies that today seem futuristic and perhaps intimidating. Arizona\u2019s approach to self-driving technology is one of cooperation, common sense and embracing innovation. Arizona stands ready to continue working with Waymo/Google and other companies developing autonomous technology to create the most supportive environment possible while also making public safety a top priority. ADOT looks forward to the next phase of Waymo\u2019s testing in Arizona and the benefits it will offer in improved safety, while also helping Arizona prepare for a technology that will revolutionize individual and commercial transport and the infrastructure supporting it. The Arizona Department of Transportation is committed to providing an environment that supports innovation, promotes safety, and reduces regulation to benefit all Arizonans. \n(FWIW, this is basically the opposite reaction that California\u2019s DMV had to Uber\u2019s brief, unlicensed self-driving test last December.)\n"}
