{"title": "Japan\u2019s answer to the Amazon Echo comes in \u2018bear\u2019 or \u2018chicken\u2019", "content": " \nWestern tech giants aren\u2019t the only ones trying to get users to talk to their computers \u2014 Japanese messaging giant Line is also getting involved. Earlier this year, the company announced it would be building a digital assistant and smart speaker, and today, at its annual conference in Tokyo, it unveiled new details about the products. \nThe basic functionality of Line\u2019s smart speaker range is similar to Google Home and Amazon Echo. You can play music, make lists, set alarms and so forth. But the Line has a secret weapon: cuteness. At the top of the page you can see a pair of the company\u2019s speakers based on two of its popular mascots: Brown the bear, and Sally the chick. (There\u2019s a whole family of Line characters that are featured on various forms of merchandise from stickers to themed cafes.) These images aren\u2019t final, but Line has confirmed that a number of these \u201ccasual and more portable\u201d cartoon smart speakers will be available winter 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine\u2019s digital assistant Clova will let the speakers handle basic tasks like playing music and taking notes.\nImage: Line\n\n\nThe company\u2019s flagship speaker will be the Wave (above), which is scheduled to go on sale in Japan this autumn for \u00a515,000 ($136). Like the company\u2019s other speakers, the Wave will be powered by Line\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant Clova. With Clova, users can maintain calendars and to-do lists, get information from the web, control smart home gadgets, and \u201ceven engage in casual conversations.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Champ speaker range will be based on Line\u2019s famous cartoon mascots.\nImage: Line\n\n\nAs is the case with Apple\u2019s HomePod, Line is also using its smart speakers to encourage adoption of its music streaming service, Line Music. The company is also working on a third smart speaker with a built-in screen, although it\u2019s not clear how this will be used. A concept image below, shows what could be animated version of Sally the cartoon chicken\u2019s face. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Face speaker is still in development.\nImage: Line\n\n\nWith the launch of its speakers and digital assistant, Line is looking to move beyond its roots and expand its reach across Asia. (Clova will be capable of talking in both Japanese and Korean.) The company\u2019s messaging app is dominant in only a handful of countries, and although it can handle a variety of tasks \u2014 including reading the news, finding jobs, and hailing taxis \u2014 Line thinks that after the smartphone boom has died down, AI services will be the next big thing. \n\u201cThere is a shift toward toward post-smartphone, post-touch technologies,\u201d Line CEO Takeshi Idezawa told Bloomberg earlier this year. \u201cThese connected devices will permeate even deeper into our daily lives and therefore must even closer match the local needs, languages, and cultures.\u201d \nCorrection June 15th, 11:00AM ET: The story has been corrected to note that, according to Line, Sally is a chicken rather than a duck. The mistake is a common one, and Line has had to point this out on a number of occasions \u2014 see this fantastic video. \n"}
