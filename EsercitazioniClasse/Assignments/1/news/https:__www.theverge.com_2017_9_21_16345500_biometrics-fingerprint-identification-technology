{"title": "This fake finger could help make our fingerprint scanners more secure", "content": " \nScientists have created a more realistic fake finger that they hope will help them improve fingerprint ID technology. \nFingerprint ID is almost ubiquitous now, but they remain the phone\u2019s biggest security vulnerability. Fake fingers already exist, but researchers at Michigan State University have created a more advanced version that can be used to test fingerprint scanners and make them harder to hack. A technical report detailing the process has been submitted to arXiv, a repository of non-peer-reviewed papers. The paper will also appear later in the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.\nIt\u2019s not too difficult to create fake fingers to hack a phone. Researchers at CITER have done this using 3D-printed molds developed from an image. At the CCC conference in 2014, a security researcher called Starbug used a high-res photo of the German defense minister\u2019s hand to create a working model. \nStudy author Anil Jain has long worked on these biometric issues. Last year, police asked his lab to re-create a dead man\u2019s fingertips to unlock his phone, and the team succeeded on the second attempt. For this new paper, Jain\u2019s team used a 3D printer to create a mold for the realistic fake finger. The finger itself is made of different types of silicone and pigments. \nTo understand why the new finger is better, let\u2019s look at how the technology works. Fingerprint readers use different methods of ID. Some are optical scanners that basically take a photo of your fingertip and see if it matches the one stored. Some use the conductivity of skin and electrical currents to create the image instead of light; these are called capacitive scanners and can create a clearer picture. Another method uses ultrasound. In these, an ultrasonic pulse presses against your finger. Depending on the specific ridges of your fingertips, some of the pulse is absorbed and some goes back to the sensor. The sensor then uses mechanical stress to detect the details of your fingertips. Ultrasound sensors see deeper than the other two, which focus on the surface level, and are more expensive and thus rarely used. \nThe lab\u2019s new finger has the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of a real finger \u2014 as opposed to most fake fingers, which only have a couple of these properties. They can be used to test the accuracy of optical versus capacitive sensors. Those are the two most common kinds, but sometimes their readings don\u2019t match up. The idea is that the new finger can help designers make their readers more accurate and sensitive. \nNext, Jain and his team will design their own fingerprint reader to test how good these fake fingers are. Meanwhile, the rest of us are obsessing over the new iPhone\u2019s facial recognition technology. Who knows what Jain\u2019s team will make from that?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
