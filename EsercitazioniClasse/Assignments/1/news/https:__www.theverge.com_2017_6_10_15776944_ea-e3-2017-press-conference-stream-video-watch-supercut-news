{"title": "Watch EA\u2019s E3 2017 press conference in 8 minutes", "content": " \nElectronic Arts kicked off E3 2017 with a brand new Madden NFL story mode starring Mahershala Ali and ended with a very, very long look at Star Wars Battlefront II's multiplayer. In between was A Way Out, a split-screen prison break game from the creators of Brothers, a very fast and furious new Need for Speed, and a tease of Bioware\u2019s new sci-fi franchise, Anthem, which we should learn more about tomorrow.\nThere were, alas, no Sims this year.\n\n\n\n\n"}
