{"title": "Google reportedly pursuing LG display deal so it can actually ship phones this year", "content": " \nGoogle has reportedly offered to invest around $880 million US (1 trillion won) in LG\u2019s Display division in an apparent bid to make sure it gets the supply of displays it needs for the next Pixel phone. According to the Electronic Times (via Reuters), the lack of a steady supply of OLED panels was one of the main reasons why Google has had such a hard time shipping the current Pixel phone. \nGoogle has apparently realized that if you\u2019re trying to break into the phone hardware business, you should probably find a way to make and sell phones to people who want to buy them. Who knew?!\nGoogle\u2019s reported investment isn\u2019t a straight purchase order for screens, rather a \u201cstrategic relationship\u201d designed to ensure that LG Display has the capital it needs to produce flexible OLED panels at scale, according to ET. Though it\u2019s probably safe to assume that Google will get guarantees of supplies as part of the deal.\nThe part of the deal that everybody\u2019s paying attention to is the \u201cflexible\u201d part of the \u201cflexible OLED\u201d equation. Samsung has been using screens that bend around the body of the phone for some time now and everybody assumed the next iPhone will as well. I\u2019m less sure that it\u2019s a lock that Google will do the same on the next Pixel. Heck, Google hasn\u2019t even committed to using the Pixel brand on its next phone. But if it doesn\u2019t find a way to reduce or remove bezels this fall (when we expect Google to ship another phone), it\u2019s going to be a pretty bad look.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Google for comment and it said that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t comment on rumor or speculation.\u201d\n"}
