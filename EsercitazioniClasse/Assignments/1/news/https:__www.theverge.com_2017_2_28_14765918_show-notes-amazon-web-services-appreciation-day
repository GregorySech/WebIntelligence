{"title": "Show Notes: Amazon Web Services Appreciation Day", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nAMAZON WEB SERVICES APPRECIATION DAY\n\nObviously the biggest news of the day was Amazon Web Services going down and taking a substantial chunk of the internet with it for four hours. (They\u2019re back now.)\n AWS is a staggering success story; you could reasonably argue that it\u2019s actually Amazon\u2019s most important business. But so many companies and services rely on it that it ripples across the entire world when it goes down. Real money was lost today.\nOur image system runs on AWS, so we\u2019ve published a bunch of stories without images today when we didn\u2019t think the news could hold. But we\u2019ve also held a bunch of stories that featured images to help tell the story, and other sites around the web have just been hosed entirely.\nHere is the headline and story Casey Newton was born to write. \nToday was also Amazon\u2019s AWSome Day, which is just lol.\n\nAJIT AJIT AJIT\n\nThe net neutrality vote passed two years ago this weekend, and to celebrate, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told a bunch of European mobile execs that net neutrality was \u201ca mistake\u201d at MWC. This isn\u2019t a surprise, since Pai voted against net neutrality and issued a stinging dissent during the vote, but make no mistake: he\u2019s out to dismantle this law.\nOne of the stories we held due to AWS being down was Jake Kastrenakes talking to a lot of people on both sides of the net neutrality debate and asking how the law has impacted the access industry. I don\u2019t want to spoil it too much \u2014 we\u2019ll run it tomorrow \u2014 but one of Pai\u2019s main talking points is that the law costs broadband companies money and hurts investment. But you can look at a lot of numbers to make a lot of arguments.... stay tuned for charts.\nPai also repeatedly took credit for the wireless carrier price war around universal plans that\u2019s currently ongoing \u2014 he drew a direct link between his decision to stop investigating zero-rating schemes and the rush to roll out unlimited plans.\nYou can argue this one both ways: zero-rating and unlimited plans are actually opposites, and what wireless carriers would do if they couldn\u2019t offer zero-rating would be... to offer unlimited plans. So it\u2019s a pretty tenuous link.\nOn the other hand, a great way for Verizon to compete with T-Mobile\u2019s popular zero-rated plans is to just say that everything is zero-rated, which is... an unlimited plan. So there\u2019s a combination of things going on here. But at the end of the day, zero-rating is bad for the internet and unlimited plans are good for the internet. The real question is how much you think the ends justify the means.\n\nYOUTUBE GOES BIG\n\n\nYouTube just launched a new TV service for $35 a month \u2014 Ben Popper has the scoop.\nAnd last night the company announced that people watch a billion hours of YouTube a day.\nAdd it up and it becomes pretty clear that YouTube has a massive advantage in getting an OTT TV service off the ground \u2014 we\u2019re already instinctively going to YouTube for video anyway, and YouTube Red is terrific. Why would you pay some other service with crashier apps and a worse interface when you could just pay to make YouTube more valuable and have more stuff in the place you\u2019re already looking? \nAnd just to make it clear that there is exactly one thing I think about: if there\u2019s no net neutrality, do you really want to live in a world where AT&T can exempt DirecTV Now from data caps while throttling YouTube unless Google pays up? Icky.\n\nSPACE RACE\n\nSo much space news is happening right now \u2014 we\u2019ve got a lot more about SpaceX\u2019s plan to send two anonymous rich people on a trip around the moon.\nIncluding some analysis of how much that might cost.\nAnd some analysis of how SpaceX can learn from our previous Apollo missions.\nAnd the fact that SpaceX is now in direct competition with NASA in a way that is actually quite exciting. Here\u2019s Loren Grush, who is heroically filing from vacation at Mardi Gras: \u201cIf SpaceX does pull off its Moon mission before NASA does, and for a much lower cost, it\u2019s a very loud message that New Space may be just as capable as Old Space \u2014 and maybe even more efficient.\u201d\nAnd President Trump will reportedly call for a return to human space exploration tonight in his address to Congress, so let\u2019s hope we can all leave this planet sooner rather than later.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nLightning round is a great name for this section today, because the WSJ reports Apple will ditch Lightning for USB-C on the next iPhone. You fall into two camps here: you believe this and think it\u2019s the best (which it would be), or you think the Journal got mixed up and Apple is just going to ship a USB-C-to-Lightning cable in the box now. Which, frankly, makes way more sense.\nGoogle isn\u2019t going to make another Chromebook Pixel. Which is super sad, because I loved the Chromebook Pixel. This company is up to something when it comes to Android and Chrome OS, but none of it seems to be particularly clear or executed particularly well right now.\nHere\u2019s the new Roborace car, which looks actually quite terrifying. Nascar might be doing everything it can to regain viewer interest, but I am way more interested in a bunch of self-driving cars blasting around a track as fast as they can. \nToday in Uber just... being Uber: Travis Kalanick was caught on tape being a jerk. By an Uber driver. Sigh.\nThere\u2019s a new Raspberry Pi that costs $10 and includes WiFi and Bluetooth! Nerd inventors, go forth an realize your dreams.\nI keep saying I\u2019m going to buy a PS4, but I just keep playing my Xbox One. And now Xbox Game Pass is basically Netflix for console games, so.... yeah.\nI want this turntable.\nFinally, watch this video we did of the new Porsche Design Book One, which is a super-hot riff on the Surface Book:\n\n\n\n\n"}
