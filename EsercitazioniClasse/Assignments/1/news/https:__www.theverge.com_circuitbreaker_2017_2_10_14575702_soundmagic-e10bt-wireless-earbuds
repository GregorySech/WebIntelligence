{"title": "SoundMagic\u2019s reputable E10 earbuds are now wireless", "content": " \nSoundMagic\u2019s E10 earbuds have been recognized as a quality budget headphone option for years. And now, they\u2019re going wireless. SoundMagic announced this week that the E10s are now available as neckbuds. They\u2019ll cost you, though. The E10BT is nearly double the price of its wired counterpart at \u00a369.99 ($87) as compared to \u00a338.99 ($48).\nSoundMagic says the E10BTs will last for 10 to 12 hours on a single charge and can be controlled through three buttons that adjust volume, start and stop music, skip tracks, and answer calls. A set includes a USB charging cable, as well as a variety of eartips and a carrying case.\nSo the sound quality on the E10BTs will likely be just as good as the wired E10s, but aesthetically, I\u2019m not so sure they\u2019re working. That\u2019s probably just because neckbuds are a fashion faux pas to me, although the shirt clip / battery pack on the back of them is particularly bad looking. But who am I to tell you what to wear? Live your truth and let me know how you style the SoundMagic neckbuds if you buy them. Maybe you can turn me into a neckbud believer.\n"}
