{"title": "Trump will call the International Space Station this morning \u2014 here\u2019s how to watch", "content": " \nThis morning at 1:27AM ET, NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson broke a significant spaceflight record during her current stay on board the International Space Station. She\u2019s now lived more than 534 days in space during her lifetime, meaning she\u2019s spent more cumulative days in space than any other American. To commemorate this occasion, President Donald Trump is going to call Whitson from Earth at 10AM ET to congratulate her on her new title.\nAnd boy does NASA really want you to watch this call. Last week, the space agency sent out a press release letting everyone know all the different channels where they can view this little chat. Not only will it be up on NASA\u2019s own online TV channel, but it will be on the agency\u2019s Facebook, YouTube, and Ustream pages. But the fun doesn\u2019t stop there. You can also watch via NASA\u2019s various apps for iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV.\nThe call is supposed to last 20 minutes\nThe call is supposed to last 20 minutes, and Trump will be joined by his daughter Ivanka as well as NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, who is back on Earth after wrapping up a nearly four-month stay on the ISS last year. It\u2019s not clear exactly what Trump and Whitson are going to discuss, but 20 minutes is a long time to simply say \u201ccongratulations.\u201d \nPerhaps we\u2019ll get some more insight into Trump\u2019s plans for space policy during his administration. So far, we know very little of what changes the new president wants for NASA \u2014 if any. While his budget proposal did make some cuts to NASA for fiscal year 2018, the agency\u2019s programs more or less stayed the same. And Trump did sign into law the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, a bill that basically keeps NASA on the same path it\u2019s been on. Meanwhile, Trump has also promised to \u201cunlock the mysteries of space\u201d and that sending astronauts to distant worlds isn\u2019t \u201ctoo big of a dream.\u201d How that translates into space policy, though, is unclear, and this morning might be a good time to hint at what\u2019s to come.\nOr maybe Trump will just want to know what living in microgravity is like. We can all find out together at 10AM ET.\n\n\n"}
