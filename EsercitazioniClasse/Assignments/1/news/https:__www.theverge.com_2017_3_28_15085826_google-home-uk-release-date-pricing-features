{"title": "Google Home launches in the UK on April 6th priced at \u00a3129", "content": " \nGoogle originally launched its Home speaker and assistant back in November in the US, and the search giant is already bringing it to other countries. Today sees the launch of Google Home in the UK, a natural expansion market for an English speaking digital assistant. Google Home will be available online on April 6th for \u00a3129 for a single device from the Google Store, or Argos, Dixons, John Lewis, and Maplins. Google is also launching colored bases for customization, these will be available for \u00a318 for fabric and \u00a336 for metal versions.\nLike Amazon's Echo, Home can answer basic queries, and do tasks like timers or control smart home devices. Google's main advantage over the Echo is its ability to handle contextual conversations. You can ask Google Home \"Who is the president of the United States?\" and then immediately ask \"When was he born?\" and Google Assistant will handle the query.\nGoogle Home in the UK will be identical to the US version\nGoogle says it has \"hidden a few British treats\" inside Home for the UK, including answering queries about hobbies or favorite foods. It appears the features available in the US version of Google Home will be supported in the UK, including any integrations with smart home devices.\nGoogle Home\u2019s launch in the UK comes exactly six months after Amazon launched its Echo devices in the UK. Amazon started selling the Echo priced at \u00a3149.99, with a \u00a350 discount for Amazon Prime members who preordered the device in advance. Google's \u00a320 discount on the retail price will put it at a price advantage, but the company will now need to prove it has enough integrations to match Amazon's 10,000 skills.\n"}
