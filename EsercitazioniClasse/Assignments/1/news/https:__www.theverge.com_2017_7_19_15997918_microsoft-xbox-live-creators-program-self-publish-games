{"title": "Xbox One self-published indie games start appearing in the store", "content": " \nMicrosoft unveiled its Xbox Live Creators Program earlier this year, designed to let indies self-publish games to the Xbox One Store. Xbox testers in the Alpha Ring are now starting to get access to a small selection of titles that are self-published in the Xbox marketplace. Windows Central reports that six indie games are available in a separate \u201cCreators Collection\u201d inside the store. Three titles are paid, and the others are free to download and install.\nThe Creators Program is still in preview, and indie developers are able to use retail Xbox One units to create and publish games. Games created in the program, which will cost developers at least $20 to join, must be Universal Windows Apps, so that they can run on Windows 10 PCs too. Microsoft is positioning this Creators Collection as a more open alternative to main games in the Xbox One Store or those published through the ID@Xbox program.\nIt sounds a lot like the old Xbox Live Indie Games that Microsoft scrapped for the Xbox One. Games for that program were developed using Microsoft XNA, and some became popular indie titles for the Xbox 360. Most of the initial test titles on this new Creators Program are a little buggy and unfinished, but this is the nature of an uncurated and open platform. Microsoft hasn\u2019t revealed exactly when the Creators Collection will be available to all Xbox One owners, but they should launch later this year.\n"}
