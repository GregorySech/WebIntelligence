{"title": "The LTE-enabled Apple Watch will cost $10 a month on US carriers", "content": " \nIf you\u2019re in the market for an Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular in the US, it will cost you $10 a month for service on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. (This is after the first three months, which are free on all three carriers.) Sprint is the lone holdout to announce monthly pricing for the Apple Watch, but if it wants to stay competitive, it will likely offer a similar deal. \nOn Verizon, adding a smartwatch to your plan usually costs $5 a month, not $10, so it\u2019s unclear why there is a price increase for the new Apple Watch. Both AT&T and T-Mobile have had $10 a month fees for smartwatches that share a number with your smartphone for years, but Verizon hasn\u2019t shared that strategy, until now. \nThe Apple Watch is designed to work with your current smartphone plan \u2014 and with your current phone number \u2014 allowing you to make and receive calls and texts without being tied to your iPhone. But whether it\u2019s worth $120 a year (or in this case, $90 a year) to occasionally take a call on a run is still an unanswered question.\nThe Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular will be available to preorder on September 15th, and will be available in stores on September 22nd.\n"}
