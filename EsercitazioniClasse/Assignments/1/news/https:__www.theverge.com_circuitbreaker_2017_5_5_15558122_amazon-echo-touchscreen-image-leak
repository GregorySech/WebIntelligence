{"title": "This might be the first image of Amazon\u2019s Echo with a touchscreen", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been rumored for a while now that Amazon is working on a touchscreen version of the Echo speaker, and today we\u2019re getting some evidence and a sense of what it\u2019ll look like.\nAFTVnews located a small photo on Amazon\u2019s servers that it believes to be the new incarnation of the Echo. Unfortunately, the image is pretty tiny, but it makes the device look like a video monitor with a big speaker beneath it. There appears to be a camera on top, too.\nAn announcement could be coming soon\nThough there aren\u2019t obvious Amazon markings in the photo, there\u2019s good reason to believe AFTVnews has actually found the new Echo here. The site previously spotted the Echo Look on Amazon\u2019s servers just over a month before the camera was revealed, and it says this picture was found in the same manner.\nCnet previously reported that the touchscreen Echo could be revealed later this month. Given that there now seems to be at least one image floating around Amazon\u2019s servers, that sounds like a real possibility.\nWe still don\u2019t know anything about what Amazon will use the touchscreen for. The camera and shape of the device suggest video calling as one obvious possibility. Amazon also has its Fire line of tablets, so we may see some crossover from there.\n"}
