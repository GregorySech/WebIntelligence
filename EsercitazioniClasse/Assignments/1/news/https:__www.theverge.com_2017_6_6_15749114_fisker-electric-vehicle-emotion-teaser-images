{"title": "Here\u2019s a sneak peek of Fisker\u2019s all-new, ultra-luxury electric car", "content": " \nLegendary car designer Henrik Fisker released some new images today of the forthcoming EMotion, an ultra-luxury electric vehicle with a range of 400 miles and a top speed of 161 mph. The images more or less track with the rendering Fisker released last year: sleek, aerodynamic lines; a low-slung hood; and a tapered back end. But the designer\u2019s company also revealed some new details about the car that could help revitalize Fisker\u2019s reputation in the EV market.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EMotion is Fisker\u2019s second attempt to capture lightning in the bottle. Back in 2011, he launched the Fisker Karma, an ultra-luxury, plug-in hybrid vehicle that was supposed to be followed by an all-electric sedan in the years to come. \nUnfortunately, Fisker never got the chance to release his own Model 3; after selling some 1,800 units of the Fisker Karma in North America and Europe, Fisker was forced to end production as a result of the bankruptcy of his battery supplier. The vehicle's manufacturer, Fisker Automotive, was later sold to Chinese auto-parts conglomerate Wanxiang. Last year, Fisker revealed his new venture, Fisker Inc., and promised his first vehicle would be released in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the release of these new images, Fisker Inc. still seems to be following the Tesla playbook to a T. The company says it will open up preorders at the end of June, at which point the vehicle will be sold directly through its website and forthcoming \u201cexperience centers.\u201d \nThe promised range on the vehicle \u2014 400 miles \u2014 is pretty impressive, considering it\u2019s over 100 miles more than a top-of-the-range Tesla. Fisker says it\u2019s able to achieve this thanks to the vehicle\u2019s \u201cadvanced high-energy density, patent-pending battery pack and cooling system.\u201d The vehicle will be charged through Fisker\u2019s proprietary \u201cUltraCharger\u201d system, that the company claims will provide over 100 miles of range in just nine minutes of charging. By comparison, Tesla\u2019s SuperChargers can replenish half the battery of a Model X in about 20 minutes.\nFisker still seems to be following the Tesla playbook to a T\nAnd, of course, the Fisker EMotion will come with fully autonomous capabilities, the company says. \u201cThe front end\u2019s bright aluminum centerpiece houses a LIDAR system behind a tinted screen. Side mirrors conceal two cameras, which enable panoramic, 360-degree views to the driver.\u201d Other details, such as whether the vehicle\u2019s autonomous features are best used on highways only or in urban environments as well, are still unknown. \nFisker did announce a deal with the Hybrid Shop, a Santa Monica-based EV maintenance and repair company, to provide \u201ca one-of-a-kind, white glove concierge service\u201d for EMotion owners. \nTo be sure, Fisker\u2019s promises don\u2019t amount to much until we see the car in action. Fisker\u2019s previous failure to capture the electric vehicle market may turn some consumers off. And with Tesla about to release the Model 3, and dozens of automakers racing to follow Elon Musk\u2019s company into the mass-market space, it\u2019s unclear how important another insanely expensive, ultra-luxury electric car still is today. \n"}
