With temperatures soaring to a high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit, American Airlines said it was forced to ground dozens of planes at of Sky Harbor International Airport. Stranded travelers were advised to contact their airlines for rebooking options or to request a refund.  \nExtreme heat affects a plane\u2019s ability to take off, especially smaller jets like those that service American Airlines\u2019 regional routes. Larger aircraft manufactured by Boeing and Airbus have maximum operating temperatures of 127 degrees. But smaller planes, like the Bombardier CRJ regional aircraft, can only operate at a maximum temperature of 118 degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: American Airlines\n\n\nThe science behind these maximum operating temperatures is pretty simple: hot air is less dense than colder air, and the more extreme the temperature, the faster a plane needs to travel in order to achieve lift. Many airports don\u2019t have long enough runways to allow planes to achieve this necessary speed during high heat. \nPatrick Smith, a pilot, blogger, and author of Cockpit Confidential, writes that hot air \u201caffects the output of the engines as well as aerodynamic capabilities, increasing the required runway distance and reducing climb performance. Therefore the amount of passengers and cargo a plane can carry are often restricted when temps are very high.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: National Weather Service\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t Phoenix\u2019s first brush with extreme heat, nor the first time soaring temperatures have led to flight cancellations. In 2013, US Airways canceled 18 flights after temperatures in Phoenix hit 119 degrees. \nIt stands to reason that these types of events will become more common as climate change continues to cause the mercury to spike. 2016 was the hottest year on record, marking the third year in a row that the world\u2019s global temperatures have set records. Previously, 2014 was considered the warmest year in recorded history, but it was eventually beat out by 2015. \n"}
