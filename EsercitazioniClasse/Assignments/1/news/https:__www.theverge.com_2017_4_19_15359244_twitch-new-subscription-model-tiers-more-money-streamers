{"title": "Twitch's new subscription model will let fans pay streamers significantly more money", "content": " \nTwitch announced today that it\u2019s adding new subscription tiers for fans to support streamers. The new tiers are priced at $9.99 and $24.99 monthly subscriptions, in addition to the existing $4.99 a month tier. \nThe new offerings are primarily designed to allow fans to support their favorite streamers on higher levels. It\u2019s a move that feels more similar to Patreon, as it offers increased opportunities for fans to give money to streamers solely to support them instead actually receiving things in return.\nThe new pricier subscriptions also make it easier for channels to unlock more custom emoticons in the Twitch chat \u2014 the $9.99 tier counts as two subscriptions towards that, while the $24.99 level counts as six. \nThe additional subscription levels will only be available on Partnered channels who choose to opt into the beta to start, with availability set to increase in the coming weeks. \n"}
