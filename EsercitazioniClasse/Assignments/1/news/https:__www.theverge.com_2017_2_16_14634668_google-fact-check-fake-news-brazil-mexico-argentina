{"title": "Google expands fact-checking feature to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico", "content": " \nGoogle News is launching its fact-checking feature in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, as part of the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to counteract fake news. In a blog post published on Wednesday, Richard Gingras, VP of Google News, said that users in the three countries will now see links from fact-checking websites in Google News search results. The sources will be listed under the \u201cfact check\u201d tag in expanded story boxes on desktop searches and in the Google News and Weather app. \nGoogle first launched its fact-check tag in the US last year, ahead of the presidential election, and the feature has since expanded to France and Germany, where national elections will be held this year. Both Google and Facebook have faced criticism for allowing fake news to spread on their platforms, and each company has publicly committed to addressing what they see as a complex issue. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to take the fake news problem very, very seriously and think about what we can do there,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said at the Code Media conference this week, adding: \u201cFake news means a lot of different things to different people, and it\u2019s often very hard to draw the line, obviously, between fake news and bad journalism.\u201d\nFollowing the US election, Google said that fake news publishers will be cut off from its advertising network, while Facebook launched a fake news filter in the US, France, and Germany. Earlier this month, both Facebook and Google announced an initiative called CrossCheck, under which 20 French media companies and the First Draft Coalition will work together to debunk false news stories related to France\u2019s upcoming presidential election.\nAlthough Facebook and Google have acknowledged the importance of flagging false or misleading news articles to users, they are each wary of being seen as \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d as Facebook vice president of partnerships Dan Rose said at the Code Media conference this week. \n\u201cWe are making a very important point of not putting ourselves in a position of deciding what\u2019s fake and not fake. I don\u2019t think people want us to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Rose said, adding that even with Facebook\u2019s fake news filters, \u201cif people want to share stories that have been flagged with their friends, that\u2019s ultimately their prerogative.\u201d       \n \n"}
