{"title": "Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller is set to direct the Neuromancer movie", "content": " \nWilliam Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer is one of the best-known works of cyberpunk, and has helped influence countless films, from The Matrix to Ghost in the Shell. According to Deadline, Deadpool director Tim Miller is now signed to direct a film adaptation for Fox, with X-Men franchise architect Simon Kinberg set to produce.\nMiller and Kinberg seems like an ideal pairing to take on the film. Neuromancer is a famously gritty cyberpunk thriller, and Miller\u2019s direction with Deadpool shows that he\u2019s certainly capable of delivering the sort of stylistic take Gibson\u2019s world deserves. Kinberg, on the other hand, is a go-to favorite for Fox, having written and overseen the latest run of X-Men films. (Miller has also been attached to a potential reboot of James Cameron\u2019s Terminator franchise, but it\u2019s not clear when or if that will happen.)\nGibson published Neuromancer in 1984, which follows a former hacker named Henry Dorsett Case, who lives in Chiba City, Japan. Poisoned by a former employer, Case finds himself unable to enter the novel\u2019s virtual world, known as the \u201cMatrix.\u201d But then an ex-military officer approaches him with an offer he can\u2019t refuse: hack a massive AI in orbit, and he\u2019ll cure Case. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe novel helped establish Gibson as one of the genre\u2019s best writers, and has been particularly influential for not only setting the tone of gritty, cyberpunk dystopias, but also popularizing the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d itself. Neuromancer has long been a target for adaptation, but has never made it before cameras: Torque director Joseph Kahn was in line to direct in 2007, while Cube and Splice director Vincenzo Natali was later attached to the project. \n\n"}
