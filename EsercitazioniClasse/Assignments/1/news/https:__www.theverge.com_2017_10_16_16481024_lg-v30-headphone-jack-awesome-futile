{"title": "LG\u2019s spirited defense of the headphone jack is futile", "content": " \nI wrote this in my LG V30 review, but it bears repeating and expanding upon: LG has crafted the best-sounding headphone audio in any smartphone yet. The V30\u2019s quad-DAC audio system is a legitimate technological advancement that delivers real joy and a tangible upgrade over every other phone out there. And it doesn\u2019t matter.\nIt pains me to type these searing words of dismissal, but we all have to face the facts. At no point in smartphone history has audio been a meaningful differentiator. HTC tried it with a long series of flagship phones, including the Beats-branded One X, the BoomSound-carrying One M7 and M8, and the One A9 with its extra powerful headphone amplifier. LG\u2019s V30 predecessors, the V10 and V20, both had upgraded DACs (digital-to-analog converters) that honestly embarrassed the stuff in other smartphones. Did they break sales records for the company? Hell, did they even help LG avoid losing money from its mobile division? Not really.\n\n\nWTF is a DAC?\nThe digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is an essential component in any modern audio system. It\u2019s the circuitry that converts the 0s and 1s of your digitally stored music into an electric signal that can be played back by headphones and speakers. The reason why DACs matter is that the process of conversion is not straightforward, there are a bunch of errors and flaws to correct for, and a perfect translation is very difficult to achieve. The best DACs can scale in price up into the tens of thousands of dollars, but most of us will experience the cheapest varieties, which come integrated in our smartphones, laptops, and basically any digital device that produces sound. Wireless headphones each have their own built-in DAC, which means their sound quality isn\u2019t dependent on the device that provides the music, the headphones do their own conversion.\n\n\nAs we gaze across the mobile landscape today, the best sellers are Apple\u2019s omnipresent iPhone, Samsung\u2019s range of Galaxy devices, and then a mass of Chinese Android phones. Apple and Samsung try to give people a complete package, but in China the things that sell are more starkly obvious: it\u2019s phones with sophisticated selfie cameras, phones with a second camera on the back, phones with portrait mode, phones with big batteries, and phones that look like iPhones. It\u2019s not that Chinese companies haven\u2019t tried putting better audio chips inside their devices \u2014 they have tried repeatedly. Last year\u2019s Nubia Z11 had a hi-res AKM AK4376 DAC and Dolby Atmos built in, and nobody cared. It\u2019s hard to even find a review of that phone that lists the particular spec.\nYou know where I\u2019m going with this. The future of mobile audio is wireless, just like Apple, Google, Motorola, and now Huawei have decided. Today\u2019s flagship launch from the latter company includes a basic Mate 10 with a headphone jack and a Mate 10 Pro that upgrades a bunch of specs, shaves down the bezels, and dumps the jack. Before the year is through, we\u2019ll see more flagship devices from more Android manufacturers making their debut sans audio port. In 2018, phones with analog audio output will be the exception rather than the rule (which they had been for over a decade).\nPeople just don\u2019t buy phones because of good audio\nI can\u2019t give you a good reason why (almost) everyone\u2019s jumping aboard this bandwagon of abandoning the standard 3.5mm jack. Samsung and LG have both demonstrated this year that they can build phones with that connector on board and wireless charging, water resistance, and ultra-slim display bezels. But, hey, it\u2019s obviously easier if you omit that extra bit of technology \u2014 which at least one Android manufacturer believes is obsolete tech that\u2019s not worth supporting anymore, given the broader industry trend. \nThe headphone jack doesn\u2019t deserve to die. But it is dying.\nI\u2019ve never seen stellar audio make a real difference to smartphone sales, and I\u2019ve no reason to expect that even better audio in the LG V30 will change that fact. It\u2019s never been about the quality of the sound, it\u2019s always been about other factors that are more important to consumers. LG is scaling new heights of audio clarity and precision, but it\u2019s doing so in the most quixotic of ways \u2014 evoking memories of Nokia finessing the perfect industrial design for a Symbian phone. What ails LG sales is the company\u2019s software, a chronic issue, and the V30\u2019s unforgivably bad OLED display, in this specific case.\nEventually, I think the headphone jack will follow the same path as matte computer displays. I will always argue that matte screens are better, because they are less affected by glare and distracting reflections and, therefore, can remain usable even in sunlit environments. But glossy displays make colors pop and seem more vibrant, and Apple popularized them with its MacBook Pro line, so now more than 90 percent of the laptops you can purchase come with a glossy display. Only stubborn stalwarts like Lenovo persist with matte displays, and I love them for it. Apple has now made phones without headphone jacks a mainstream thing, and the likeliest scenario is that LG will play the Lenovo role of continuing to offer superlative analog audio when everyone else has moved on to doing other things.\nMobile phone makers tend to follow one another\u2019s lead\nWith Bluetooth headphones improving every year and consumer preferences leaning toward wireless convenience, LG\u2019s perseverance as the purveyor of excellent sound from phones is unlikely to pay off commercially. The company will get plaudits from people like me \u2014 people who like matte displays, hate RGB LED lights on their PCs, and don\u2019t mind wearing bulky wired headphones in public \u2014 but those won\u2019t cover the cost of running a global mobile business. A headphone jack is still a nice feature to have, and LG has truly perfected the audio coming out of it this year, but it isn\u2019t an essential one. Nobody will be going out to buy an $800 phone just on the strength of its audio, whereas many people might spend similar money for a phone with an equally impressive display or camera.\nI hope I\u2019m wrong, but as things stand, LG\u2019s heroic efforts to keep the headphone jack alive are merely delaying the inevitable and contributing little to the company\u2019s bottom line.\n"}
