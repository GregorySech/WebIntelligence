A preliminary report issued that July stated his vehicle was going 74 mph at the time of the crash, on a highway with a 65 mph speed limit. \nIn a statement released Monday, Brown\u2019s family did not fault Tesla for the fatal crash and faulted media reports over excessive speeding and careless behavior. \n\u201cWe heard numerous times that the car killed our son,\u201d the family said. \u201cThat is simply not the case.\u201d \nWhile the board faulted Brown for not paying attention in the seconds before the crash, they noted Autopilot did not do an adequate job of detecting other traffic and did not inform the driver early enough to allow for sufficient reaction time. The board also noted the driver of the truck, who did not make himself available for the investigation, likely had time to see Brown\u2019s Tesla before the crash. \n\u201cWe appreciate the NTSB\u2019s analysis of last year\u2019s tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said in an email to The Verge following the safety agency\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\u201d\nNTSB called out other automakers with Level 2 self-driving systems\nThe NTSB recommendations will be reviewed by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. While Tesla was at the center of the investigation, the NTSB\u2019s findings also called out Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo and suggested their Level 2 systems come with better warnings and improved monitoring technologies to prevent them from being used irresponsibly by drivers.\n\u201cToday\u2019s recommendations, if acted upon,\u201d Hart said, \u201cwill help provide system safeguards, make standardized safety data available, and improve the safety of partially automated vehicles and everyone who shares the road with them.\u201d\n"}
