{"title": "Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s next book of retro sci-fi art is now on Kickstarter", "content": " \nSimon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s artwork is a delight. It\u2019s wonderfully retro science fiction design that is set against the surroundings of rural Sweden. We\u2019ve been fans of St\u00e5lenhag work for a couple of years now, and today, he launched a Kickstarter to produce his next art book, titled The Electric State. \nSt\u00e5lenhag Kickstarted his two other narrative art books, Tales from the Loop, and Things from the Flood. Both books are weird hybrids of novels and art collections. They tell a loose story of an alternate Sweden in the \u201880s and \u201890s, the development of a massive particle accelerator called The Loop, and its unexplained side effects. Last year, St\u00e5lenhag also Kickstarted a role-playing game based on Tales from the Loop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Free League Publishing\n\n\nThe Electric State will follow those two other books, but it doesn\u2019t look as though it\u2019s connected to his Loop books. Instead, the description explains that this book is set in 1997, following a runaway teenager and her yellow toy robot as they explore an alternate United States \u201cwhere the ruins of gigantic battle drones litter the countryside heaped together with the discarded trash of a high tech consumerist society in decline.\u201d \nSt\u00e5lenhag says that The Electric State will mainly be composed of illustrations that he\u2019s been posting online in the last year, which include more abandoned locations, cool robots, and futuristic buildings. Backers can pick up the basic art book for around $41 USD, should the project hit its $23,494 goal. Other levels include limited edition copy and prints of his artwork. \n\n"}
