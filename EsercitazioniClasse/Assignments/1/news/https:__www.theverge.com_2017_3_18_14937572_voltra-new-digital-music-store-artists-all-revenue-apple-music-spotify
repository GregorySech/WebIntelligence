{"title": "This new digital music store could change the way we pay artists", "content": " \nPaolo Fragomeni can play half a dozen instruments and owned around 4,500 LP records and a thousand 45s at the peak of his vinyl collection. When wanderlust took over, he digitized his entire library into about 50,000 portable MP3s that he could take wherever he traveled. The music industry has become increasingly populated by streaming services that offer a similar ability to listen to music anywhere, but the lack of ownership concerns Fragomeni. In the age of Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Tidal, the self-professed music collector saw an opportunity to cater to listeners like himself who want to own their music.\nAlongside co-founder Aprile Elcich, he created Voltra, a digital music player and store that promises artists who sign up directly with Voltra will receive 100 percent of the revenue from the streams and purchases of their songs.\nVoltra is a response to the growing dominance of streaming services in the contemporary music landscape. Spotify currently boasts more than 50 million subscribers, while Apple Music reached 20 million subscribers at the end of last year. Yet Fragomeni, whose previous startup venture Nodejitsu was acquired by GoDaddy in 2015, believes there will always be dedicated connoisseurs who are interested in actually owning music.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty significant population of people who collect and own music, and I think that product space was a little bit neglected,\u201d he says. \u201cAs music lovers, we really wanted to have a product that was totally focused on music ownership.\u201d\nVoltra\u2019s desktop and mobile players \u2014 currently in beta testing \u2014 are free to download. Any users with a Voltra account can choose to either buy songs immediately or try out a new song with Voltra\u2019s \u201cstream-to-own\u201d feature. It allows users to listen to an entire song once for free and then pay a small fee for each consecutive listen. After the 10th play, the track is fully paid for and officially owned by the user. Though artists and labels are able to opt out of the stream-to-own option, Fragomeni says the majority of Voltra\u2019s catalog will be available with this feature.\nFor Fragomeni, this model offers listeners a low-cost way to figure out if they enjoy a particular song while also ensuring that artists earn money off the songs that get played the most. Eliminating the 30-second free preview is a particular point of pride for Fragomeni: \u201cThirty-second previews actually suck, because you might totally miss this really awesome guitar solo at 1:10, but that got cut off from the preview, so you never decide that you\u2019re going to buy that song.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Voltra\n\n\nVoltra users can also purchase a premium membership upgrade for $10 a month. Premium members still pay for individual tracks, but they also receive access to the Voltra Audio Archive, which automatically backs up the listener\u2019s music files to Amazon Glacier storage. Fragomeni views the premium option as targeted toward \u201cusers who are invested in owning music and want a secure and long-term music archiving solution.\u201d This emphasis on lasting storage contrasts with subscription-based streaming services, where canceling your account comes with the risk of losing personally curated playlists and listening history.\nFragomeni views Voltra as having an \u201cethical mission\u201d in which \u201cit\u2019s really important for us to create a relationship between artists and listeners.\u201d To accomplish this, Voltra encourages the discovery of new music for its users to own. Fragomeni describes Voltra\u2019s music player and store as \u201csymbiotic,\u201d since the app generates song recommendations for users based on the music they already own.\nVoltra aims to strengthen two facets of this artist-listener relationship: If music ownership is Voltra\u2019s priority for listeners, sufficient compensation is the company\u2019s goal for artists.\nBoth Fragomeni and Elcich have spent time playing in bands, and they continue to surround themselves with musicians. With the peer-to-peer opportunities of the internet age, Fragomeni recalls that the pair began to question why there were \u201cso many middlemen taking a cut from artists who are trying to sell their music.\u201d\nSo the co-founders decided that artists who sign up directly through Voltra would receive 100 percent of their earnings, since the company doesn\u2019t deduct a commission from their song profits. This applies to artists who sell their music directly on Voltra; with labels and distributors, Voltra takes a cut of ten percent. It\u2019s also free for artists to upload their music to Voltra\u2019s store. Voltra \u2014 which is not ad-supported \u2014 earns additional revenue from its sale of Pro Features to artists, labels, and distributors for five to ten dollars a month, offering musicians additional perks like customizable sales reports or a public artist page on the Voltra site.\n\u201cThe ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.\u201d\nFragomeni cites his view that artists \u2014 particularly independent artists \u2014 are not earning enough revenue from popular streaming services as one of the inspirations for his company\u2019s business model. As Voltra prepares to launch publicly, songwriters and their representatives are currently appearing before the Copyright Royalty Board to argue for an increase in their per-stream earning rate from companies like Alphabet, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify.\nThe Voltra team points to data from the artists\u2019 rights blog The Trichordist, which claims that a musician can earn 99 cents after only 10 streams on Voltra, compared to 226 streams on Spotify, 134 on Apple Music, and 146 on Google Play. Spotify\u2019s average payout per stream reportedly ranges from $0.006 to $0.0084, which is split among the the music's various \"rights holders,\u201d meaning that 226 streams would yield about $1.50, of which the artist would receive some portion. Resonate, a \u201cstreaming music cooperative\u201d that began development last year, offers a stream-to-own system that is similar to Voltra\u2019s \u2014 Resonate listeners fully pay for a track after nine plays \u2014 though Resonate deducts the standard streaming service commission of 30 percent of revenue, according to Forbes.\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s weird that [Voltra\u2019s business model] is novel,\u201d Fragomeni says, \u201cbut I really believe that it\u2019s possible to have a sustainable business with really cool premium services where the ultimate ethical objective is to try to have the artists be paid.\u201d\nAccording to Fragomeni, about 5,000 participants have already registered in Voltra\u2019s beta test, and the store offers nearly 3 million tracks. (For comparison, Spotify currently features more than 30 million songs.) Voltra aims to go live after reaching 10 million tracks, with Fragomeni tentatively projecting a launch date in late May.\n"}
