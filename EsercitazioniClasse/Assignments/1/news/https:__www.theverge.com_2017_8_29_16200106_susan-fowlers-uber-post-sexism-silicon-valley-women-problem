{"title": "Susan Fowler\u2019s Uber post was the first shot in a new war against Silicon Valley sexism", "content": " \nLast Tuesday, California state Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson introduced a bill that will amend the California civil code to tackle an on-going pattern of sexist conduct in Silicon Valley \u2014  specifically the sexual harassment in the venture capitalist-entrepreneur context. \nThe bill is a direct reaction to a story published in June in which two dozen women entrepreneurs spoke to the New York Times about being harassed by venture capitalists. \u201cThere is such a massive imbalance of power that women in the industry often end up in distressing situations,\u201d said Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, to the Times. \nThe bill\u2014SB 224\u2014is the latest in a long chain of events that began with a blogpost by a female Uber engineer in February. Susan Fowler\u2019s damning account of working at the company\u2014meticulously documented and described in the coldest of terms\u2014precipitated an internal investigation into Uber, resulting in the firing of 20 employees. Shortly after, a female data analyst and another female engineer who worked for Uber also came forward with their stories. Among others, these incidents added to the pressure that resulted in founder Travis Kalanick stepping down as CEO. \nMeanwhile, what was happening at Uber was echoing across the industry in other companies. In late February, a female engineer sued Tesla for sexual harassment and discrimination\u2014and was later fired in what she claims was retaliation. \nThen multiple women came forward, claiming they had been harassed by venture capitalist Justin Caldwell of Binary Capital. The accusations snowballed until Caldbeck resigned, and Binary Capital collapsed when investors pulled their funds. \n\u201cSusan [Fowler] inspired us,\u201d Leiti Hsu, an entrepreneur who accused Caldbeck of groping her, told the Los Angeles Times. \nWith the collapse of Binary Capital, more women came forward to accuse other venture capitalists, like Dave McClure and Chris Sacca.\n\u201c[T]he Uber scandal feels different. It feels like a watershed,\u201d Farhad Manjoo wrote in March, speculating that this was the moment that the industry was going to finally take sexism seriously and begin to clean house. Recent legislative action and the emergence of  independent whistleblowers suggest Manjoo was right. But why, after decades of inaction, is change finally coming to Silicon Valley now?\nUntil recently, the government has been largely content to let the tech industry handle its own diversity problems\nUntil recently, the government has been largely content to let the tech industry handle its own diversity problems. Starting in 2014, big tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook began publishing voluntarily diversity reports, vowing to do better. Other companies followed suit. Everyone knew the industry had a sexism problem, yet no specific case merited real repercussions to the companies or individuals involved. \nWomen who spoke out publicly, like Julie Ann Horvath of GitHub or Amelie Lamont of Squarespace, left or were terminated from employment while their companies\u2019 reputations quickly bounced back. Ellen Pao took her gender discrimination case against VC firm Kleiner Perkins all the way to trial, and lost. In an excerpt of her forthcoming book, she disclosed that the stress of the lawsuit and the accompanying online harassment she received for it, may have contributed to a miscarriage. \u201cI felt, in that moment, that Kleiner had taken everything from me,\u201d she wrote.\nThere is still a price for speaking out. \u201cI am actually in debt for whistleblowing,\u201d Susan Fowler wrote on Twitter. She added a small parenthetical note that spoke volumes: \u201cworth it.\u201d\nSpeaking may have cost Fowler financially, but it also began a chain reaction much bigger than the \u201cPao effect\u201d of lawsuits and disclosures that began after the 2014 Ellen Pao trial. In the wake of the recent disclosures around Caldwell and Binary Capital\u2014disclosures apparently inspired by Fowler\u2019s blogpost\u2014venture capitalists like Reid Hoffman have called for investors to sign a \u201cdecency pledge.\u201d \n\u201cNo matter how well-intentioned, decency pledges won\u2019t cut it,\u201d says Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, the nonprofit women\u2019s rights organization that is sponsoring SB 224. Farrell says that up until this point, venture capitalists clearly believed that sexual harassment law didn\u2019t apply to them. The venture capitalist-entrepreneur relationship, after all, isn\u2019t a typical workplace relationship. \u201cIn many respects it was viewed as a legal free-for-all,\u201d she said. \nOf course, that\u2019s not true: California Civil Code 51.9 imposes liability for sexual harassment when there is a \u201cbusiness, service, or professional relationship\u201d between the plaintiff and defendant. Any business, service, or professional relationship will do. But just in case the law isn\u2019t clear enough in certain situations, the statute enumerates several specific types of relationships that aren\u2019t just employer-employee relationships: relationships with teachers, landlords, attorneys, physicians. Jackson\u2019s bill\u2014SB 224\u2014adds venture capitalists to that list. \n\u201cNow while I do believe discrimination is already outlawed under California law, the unique nature of the investor-entrepreneur relationship is one that could stand additional clarity in order to provide certainty so that women know that they have the support of the law behind them,\u201d said Senator Jackson in a press call announcing the bill. \n Silicon Valley is finally being forced to reckon with its endemic sexism\nIn addition to state legislators looking head-on at pervasive discrimination inside the tech industry, several high-profile lawsuits remain pending in the courts: AJ Vandermeyden\u2019s case against Tesla, Elizabeth Scott\u2019s sexual harassment case against UploadVR, and Tina Huang\u2019s class action lawsuit against Twitter.  \nIn announcing her bill, Senator Jackson made passing references to both an incendiary internal memo at Google in which an engineer opined that women may be less suited to computer programming due to biological reasons and to the scandals around Uber as indicators of a culture in need of change. Jackson praised the women who spoke to the Times as \u201cpeeling back a shroud of secrecy,\u201d and suggested that the stories that had been reported were merely \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d \nAll of which adds up to a sense that finally, for the first time, Silicon Valley is finally being forced to reckon with its endemic sexism.\n\u201cFor reasons I can\u2019t figure out, more women are coming forward, even if they don\u2019t litigate,\u201d says Joan C. Williams, a law professor at UC Hastings whose scholarship has focused on women in the workplace, particularly in the technology industry. \u201cJust to have women being public about the kinds of things that are happening to them\u2014and I\u2019m thinking here about Uber and having other women come forward as well\u2026  it can be powerful. Things like sexual harassment survive in the dark, and in a culture where people are apprehensive to say anything for fear.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if that\u2019s changed, so I\u2019m trying to figure out why all these women are coming forward now,\u201d Williams added.\nFarrell says that historically two factors have dampened sexual harassment litigation in tech: job mobility and arbitration clauses. Many women in the tech industry have reached out to Equal Rights Advocates through their helpline, only to conclude that they\u2019d rather \u201cmove on\u201d than file a lawsuit. But that seems to be changing, says Farrell. For whatever reason, she says, \u201cwomen are realizing that going to the next company doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t suffer from sexual harassment.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out why all these women are coming forward now.\u201d\nPervasive arbitration clauses in employment agreements that force sexual harassment victims to settle complaints quietly out of court instead of engaging in a legal battle also pose a barrier. And nondisparagement clauses, which prevent former employees from speaking against their former employers, are fairly standard in the tech industry. The proliferation of nondisparagement agreements silences complaints and generates a chilling effect across the industry\u2014a problem noted by both Susan Fowler and Ellen Pao. \nAnd yet despite the hurdles the chill has lifted in 2017, and stories of harassment continue to trickle out\u2014stories that have forced industry figureheads call for decency pledges and state legislatures to propose bills. SB 224 is due to be introduced in January, when the California senate\u2019s new session begins. \nAt the federal level, agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, National Labor Relations Board, and even the Securities and Exchange Commission have already been placing greater scrutiny on non-disparagement agreements\u2014although how this will change under the Trump administration remains to be seen. \nMeanwhile, Fowler has filed an amicus brief in a consolidated set of three labor law cases before the Supreme Court (captioned Epic Systems v. Lewis) that challenges the power of companies to force workers into arbitration. The question before the court is whether class action waivers in arbitration agreements\u2014which surrender a worker\u2019s right to bring or be included in a class action lawsuit\u2014are lawful. \nFowler, like other Uber employees, signed a class action waiver as a condition of employment. Her brief\u2014written by her lawyer, Curtis Baker\u2014implies that workplace protections have broken down so much that workers can only resort to disruptive acts of whistleblowing. \u201cBut for Ms. Fowler\u2019s perhaps na\u00efve courage in publishing her post \u2013 for which she faced an attempted smear campaign and a surreptitious investigation into her friends and family \u2013 Uber\u2019s workplace would have remained exactly the same.\u201d \nAside from the reference to Fowler\u2019s \u201cnaive courage,\u201d her lawyer doesn\u2019t provide much insight into why Fowler blew the whistle. The intent is maybe beside the point. The snowball effect from Fowler\u2019s blogpost continues, toppling CEOs and venture capital firms, launching legislation\u2014whistleblowers inspiring more whistleblowers, each successive disruption forcing change on an industry that, despite all its talk about moving fast and breaking things, has resisted change thus far. \n\n"}
