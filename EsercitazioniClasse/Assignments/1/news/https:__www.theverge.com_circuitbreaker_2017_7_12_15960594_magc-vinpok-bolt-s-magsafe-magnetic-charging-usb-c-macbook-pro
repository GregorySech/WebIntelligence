{"title": "Here are some more ways to bring MagSafe charging back to your USB-C MacBook Pro", "content": " \nOne of the subtler design changes in Apple\u2019s recent MacBook and MacBook Pro models was the replacement of Apple\u2019s magnetically detaching MagSafe charger with standard USB-C ports for charging the laptops. In the past, Apple has made no secret of its efforts to enforce its MagSafe patents, so it was a little surprising to see them switch to USB-C. And the jury is still out as to whether or not that was the right move. In the time since the 12-inch MacBook launched in 2015 \u2014 and particularly in the wake of the more recent USB-C MacBook Pros from last year \u2014 there have been no shortage of enterprising companies looking to fill the magnetic charging void that Apple has left on its laptop. \nWe\u2019ve covered a bunch of these in the past: Griffin\u2019s BreakSafe cable, which was one of the first to reach the market; the MagNeo, which was the first to offer charging and data; the AnyWatt dongle, a Kickstarter campaign that promises to let you use your old MagSafe chargers with your new MacBook; and even Apple is rumored to be working on a solution of some kind. \nBut it seems that the marketplace isn\u2019t quite saturated enough yet, which is why we have two new entrants in the \u201cUSB-C MagSafe adapter\u201d field making the rounds this week. \n\nFirst up is the MagC, another Kickstarter project that claims to offer \u201cthe best of three worlds\u201d in combining USB-C and MagSafe. It works more or less the same as most of the other adapters: a small USB-C attachment is plugged into one of the ports by your laptop, which a magnetic connector then attaches to in turn to charge. (MagC claims their cable supports up to 100W.) Unlike most of the other breakaway cables, the MagC claims to support Thunderbolt 3 data transfer as well as charging, which is nice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagC (render)\n\n\nOtherwise, most interesting addition from the MagC, aside from the relatively low profile of the adapter, is that the connector for the wall plug also accepts a USB-C port, instead of being a wholly proprietary power cable. On the less useful side of things, the MagC resurrects the original L-shaped connector from the first generation of the MagSafe \u201cto honor Steve Job\u2019s original design,\u201d which is a terrible reason to embrace a worse design. The MagC is available for an early-bird price of $29 on Kickstarter, and expects to ship in December, although the usual crowdfunding warnings apply.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Vinpok Bolt-S, which is up for preorder at Vinpok\u2019s website for $29.99 (The company says it will eventually cost $60.) Like the other options, it features a small adapter to plug into your laptop, or other USB-C device, with a proprietary magnetic connector that attaches for charging. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinpok Bolt-S\n\n\nVinpok\u2019s claim to fame with the Bolt-S is that it\u2019s the first cable to support the 87 watts that Apple\u2019s 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar\u2019s charger supplies, which may or may not be true, depending on whether or not it hits the market before the MagC. And like the Griffin BreakSafe, it only supports charging, not data transfer. Vinpok isn\u2019t saying when the Bolt-S will actually ship \u2014 in fact, the preorder page currently doesn\u2019t even work \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to say when customers will actually be able to buy it. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll continue to see more of these breakaway-style cables in the future. People really like MagSafe and magnetic chargers, and ultimately choice and competition is never a bad thing, even if it seems more likely that \u2014 like it or not \u2014 the industry is going to move toward USB-C for everything. \n"}
