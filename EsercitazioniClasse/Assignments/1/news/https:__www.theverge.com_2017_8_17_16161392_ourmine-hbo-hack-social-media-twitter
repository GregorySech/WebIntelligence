Now, it appears that hacker group OurMine took over the company\u2019s social media accounts last night. \nThe social media hack was first reported by Variety (which, coincidentally, was once the target of an OurMine hack itself). In a screenshot of the alleged breach, hackers tweeted from the official HBO account that they were \u201cjust testing your security.\u201d\n\n\nBREAKING: Yet another hack problem for HBO tonight...this time to it's social media accounts https://t.co/oCRuBsqx1e pic.twitter.com/AM1g7dHL0E\u2014 Andrew Wallenstein (@awallenstein) August 17, 2017\n\n\n\nOurMine has previously taken advantage of malicious or compromised plugins; their list of hacked targets includes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and BuzzFeed. The attacks on HBO appear to be unrelated to previous leaks.\nVariety reports that, in addition to HBO\u2019s main Twitter account, the group also briefly took control of the Game of Thrones account. Both accounts are functioning normally again, for now. \n"}
