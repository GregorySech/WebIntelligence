That figure, which is more than 10 times the number of people reportedly exposed to Russia-linked advertising on the site, indicates that more than half of US Facebook users saw Russia-linked posts in the months leading up to the election.\nThe figures are disclosed in prepared testimony scheduled to be delivered Tuesday by Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. \u201cThe foreign interference we saw is reprehensible and outrageous and opened a new battleground for our company, our industry and our society,\u201d the testimony says. \u201cThat foreign actors, hiding behind fake accounts, abused our platform and other internet services to try to sow division and discord \u2014 and to try to undermine our election process \u2014 is an assault on democracy, and it violates all of our values.\u201d \nThe foreign interference we saw is reprehensible and outrageous\nThe testimony says that 29 million people were directly served 80,000 posts linked to Russian actors between January 2015 and August 2017. Likes, shares, and comments on those posts delivered them to the additional 97 million people. Facebook has 213 million monthly users in the United States.\nThe activity was not limited to Facebook \u2014 the company also will testify that it deleted 170 Instagram accounts, which posted about 120,000 pieces of content. The testimony does not say how many people were reached by the Instagram posts.\nFacebook previously disclosed that 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency. The company has said it will introduce new tools intended to identify the buyers of political advertising and make the ads available for public inspection.\nGoogle will testify it found 18 channels \u201clikely associated with Russian agents\u201d\nIn his testimony, Stretch plans to lay out Facebook\u2019s plans for addressing future attempts at foreign election meddling, including new tools designed to purge inauthentic accounts and adding 1,000 new employees to review political ads manually.\nSeparately, the New York Times reported that Google will testify it found 18 channels \u201clikely associated\u201d with Russian agents who posted political videos to YouTube. Google has suspended the accounts, which uploaded more than 1,100 videos between 2015 and 2017, according to the Times. The vast majority of the videos had low view counts, with only 3 percent having more than 5,000 views, the report said.\nStretch\u2019s testimony is scheduled to take place at 2:30PM ET, and will be carried live on CSPAN-3 and on CSPAN\u2019s Facebook page.\n"}
