{"title": "Arianna Huffington's new app lets you humblebrag about turning your phone off", "content": " \nArianna Huffington has partnered with Samsung to create an app that helps you disconnect from the internet while also humblebragging to your friends that you can\u2019t be reached. The app, called Thrive, will be available in December exclusively for Samsung devices only through the Samsung Galaxy Store.\nTo be fair, a lot of what Thrive does is already available by toggling the Do Not Disturb button on Samsung devices. Like Do Not Disturb, Thrive can schedule times to be disconnected as well as whitelist people / notifications that can reach you even when the app is enabled. Unlike Do Not Disturb, if someone not on your \u201cVIP\u201d list tries to contact you while your phone is in \u201cThrive Mode,\u201d a text will be sent to them that you\u2019re \u201cthriving.\u201d \nIf someone tries to contact you, the app will automatically send a text that you\u2019re \u201cthriving\u201d\nIt\u2019s a little, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t talk because I\u2019m too busy living my best life,\u201d but whatever. We live in a world where we have to let others know how awesome we are on digital platforms, and now, it seems, how awesome we are on digital platforms because we\u2019re not using said digital platforms. I guess it\u2019s good marketing for Thrive as well.\nPlatitudes about disconnecting aside, the app does have some features that could be useful if someone really wanted to curb their digital consumption. Under \u201cApp Control,\u201d Thrive shows you how much time you spend using particular apps, a statistic that would divulge the scary amount of hours I\u2019ve spent playing Ace Attorney as of late (thanks, Natt Garun). You can set time restrictions for individual apps here, or block using them altogether for periods of time. And, while you can break any of these digital time outs early, there\u2019s also something called a \u201cSuper Thrive Mode,\u201d which bypasses that option. Enable that, and there\u2019s no backsies until the time limit you\u2019ve set expires.\nHuffington says she hopes this app will help you \u201crecalibrate your relationship with technology.\u201d If you\u2019re a Samsung user and want to participate in the preview Beta, check out the app\u2019s website before it goes live on December 15th.\n"}
