{"title": "Comcast will launch $65 / month unlimited mobile service later this year", "content": " \nAfter years of discussion, Comcast is finally getting ready to launch its wireless phone service.\nThe service will be called Xfinity Mobile, and it\u2019s supposed to launch sometime in the near future.\nIt isn\u2019t going to be widely available, however. Xfinity Mobile will only be available to Comcast\u2019s existing customers \u2014 the company\u2019s goal here is to build an even bigger bundle for existing TV, landline, and internet subscribers.\nComcast is piggybacking on Verizon\u2019s network\nMost Comcast customers will be able to subscribe to an Xfinity Mobile plan with unlimited data for $65 per month per line, but customers with some of the more expensive X1 TV plans will be able to get it for only $45 per month. Comcast will also offer a pay-as-you-go service for $12 per gigabyte.\nThose prices are slightly cheaper than typical wireless plans, and Comcast is hoping a few other perks will draw customers in: it won\u2019t charge arbitrary line access fees; it\u2019ll let families have some phones on the unlimited plan and others on the pay-as-you-go plan; and it\u2019ll let pay-as-you-go customers switch in the middle of a month over to an unlimited plan, without penalty. It\u2019s also offering 24/7 support over text message.\nAt launch, Xfinity Mobile will support phones from Apple, Samsung, and LG \u2014 though only a selection from each. It\u2019ll have the last two years of iPhone models, it\u2019ll have Samsung\u2019s S7 and S8 models, and it\u2019ll offer LG\u2019s X Power, a midrange phone with a large battery in it.\nComcast\u2019s offering is going to be pretty different from the typical wireless service. Rather than owning and operating its own cell towers, Comcast is essentially renting wireless space from Verizon \u2014 so Comcast\u2019s customers will actually be connecting to Verizon\u2019s network. That means Comcast will immediately have nationwide reach.\nSmooth Wi-Fi handoff is going to be critical to Xfinity Mobile\u2019s success\nBut because Comcast has to pay Verizon for the data it uses, Comcast\u2019s wireless plan is designed to push customers onto Wi-Fi as often as possible. Customers aren\u2019t just paying for access to wireless service, they\u2019re also paying for access to Comcast\u2019s network of 16 million Wi-Fi hotspots.\nComcast says that phones connected to Xfinity Mobile will be set up to automatically find and connect to any nearby Wi-Fi hotspot. That data won\u2019t count toward monthly caps, and it\u2019ll likely be delivered at faster speeds than what\u2019s offered over Verizon\u2019s wireless network. Comcast also clarified that no services would be zero-rated over Xfinity Mobile, including its own Stream TV offering. It won\u2019t be offering voice-over Wi-Fi either.\nThis unconventional format has been tried before by companies like Republic Wireless, but it has yet to catch on in a big way. For that to happen, Comcast will have to prove that it can make Wi-Fi handoffs happen without interrupting customers\u2019 connectivity.\nComcast executives seemed surprisingly unaware that this might be an issue. During a call with investors, someone asked if Xfinity Mobile would do anything about the \u201cshitty\u201d handoff ordeal people often experience on phones, and executives laughed and said they\u2019d have to make it a new goal.\n\u201cI would say that we get it. Wi-Fi today is not what it should be,\u201d said Comcast Cable president Dave Watson. \u201cWe have room to improve. But I would say this: one of the things that I talked about today is, just like X1, just like other product areas, our aspirations are to constantly improve the Wi-Fi experience.\u201d\nXfinity Mobile has been in testing inside of Comcast, and today the company is beginning to expand the test to all of its employees. While Comcast didn\u2019t give a firm launch date for Xfinity Mobile, the company said a consumer launch would follow internal tests \u201csoon thereafter.\u201d\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.\n"}
