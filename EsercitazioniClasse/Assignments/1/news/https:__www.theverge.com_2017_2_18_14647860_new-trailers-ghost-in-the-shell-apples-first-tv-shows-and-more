{"title": "New trailers: Ghost in the Shell, Apple\u2019s first TV shows, and more", "content": " \nIt\u2019s always fun seeing locations you recognize pop up in movies. It sort of lets you feel like you\u2019re in on the secret, like you know the world these characters exist in better than they do.\nWhat\u2019s even better, and tougher, is when a film actually tries to inhabit a location, to imbue a location\u2019s attitude throughout the picture. That\u2019s one thing I thought the film adaptation of Fences absolutely nailed (among many others: see its four Oscar nominations).\nThe city of Pittsburgh is such a part of the movie. The home the characters live in feels like it could be any in the city \u2014 your\u2019s, your neighbor\u2019s. There\u2019s a real sense that the city affects them and that they have a life there. It\u2019s all the more important since the story rarely ever leaves the main characters\u2019 house; somehow, an entire world gets fit into a couple rooms and a backyard.\nCheck out 12 trailers from this week below.\n\nGhost in the Shell\nGiven the option, I'd trade the second and third Matrix films for two more minutes of footage like this. The film is out March 31st.\n\nThe Bad Batch\nAna Lily Amirpour caught our attention in 2014 with the dark, stylish, and fantastic A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Now she's back with The Bad Batch, which seems like a continuation of all those traits but transformed into an even stranger new world. Imagine Mad Max, but with house music. It comes out June 23rd.\n\nCarpool Karaoke: The Series\nApple has been toying with bringing TV series to Apple Music, and its first big title is a spinoff of the The Late Late Show's hit segment Carpool Karaoke. The series has plenty of big names on board \u2014 including Will Smith, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Ariana Grande \u2014 but we'll have to see if the concept has lasting power when blown out to a full series. It doesn't have a release date just yet.\n\nPlanet of the Apps\nAnd here's the trailer for Apple's other Apple Music series, Planet of the Apps, which I think everyone in the world has much lower expectations for. It\u2019s like Shark Tank, but for apps. No release date here either.\n\nSandy Wexler\nAdam Sandler's latest for Netflix seems like more of a throwback to his ridiculous characters of the \u201990s, with him starring as an impossibly strange and kind of dumb talent manager. He's also called in some serious favors from his friends: this trailer shows cameos from Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Judd Apatow, and more. This'll be the third in Sandler's four-film deal with Netflix. It comes out April 14th.\n\nCosplay Melee\nSyfy is bringing together a bunch of cosplayers for a reality show that has them racing to design some elaborate new costumes. For cosplay fans (and creators), it could be a pretty interesting look into how these outfits get made. The series starts March 21st.\n\nThe House\nThis is a pretty straightforward comedy, so I don't have much to add other than that I imagine the producers of this movie assumed there'll be plenty of people willing to see a comedy headlined by Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler. They\u2019re probably right. It comes out June 30th.\n\nFeud: Bette and Joan\nRyan Murphy, the guy behind basically every anthology series (American Horror Story, American Crime Story, Scream Queens), is behind yet another upcoming anthology series called Feud, which is, I guess, about feuds. This first one dramatizes a fight between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in 1962 Hollywood. Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon star. It starts March 5th.\n\nSong to Song\nTerrence Malick has made La La Land Part II, or, well, something like that. Song to Song puts Ryan Gosling in another movie about aspiring artists \u2014 just this time, instead of wonderfully choreographed dancing, we're getting Malick's typically floaty camerawork and lots of people falling all over the place. There's still a ton of color. The film opens March 17th.\n\nThe Sinner\nThis looks like it could be an interesting twist on a crime thriller, with the show not worrying about finding a culprit but with figuring out why a killer decided to kill. Jessica Biel stars. The show comes to USA sometime this summer.\n\nThe Void\nThis. Looks. Creepy. (And stylish.) It'll be out in the UK on March 31st and in the US on April 7th.\n\nHounds of Love\nThis trailer tells a ridiculously scary story without ever showing a single \"scary\" thing. And even without the detail, you can probably guess what this film is about: a couple of serial killers. It comes out May 12th in the US.\n"}
