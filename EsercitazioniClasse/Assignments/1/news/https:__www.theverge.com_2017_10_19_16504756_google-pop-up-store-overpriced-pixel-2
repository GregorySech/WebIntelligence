{"title": "Google will reimburse customers who overpaid for Pixel 2 at pop-up stores", "content": " \nI spent a good amount of time at Google\u2019s New York City pop-up shop this morning, and while the product demo areas were great \u2014 and felt true to what you\u2019d imagine a Google retail store to be \u2014 the actual buying process was anything but. \nMost of the staffers spread around the Flatiron location definitely seem to be Google employees, as they\u2019re all fairly knowledgeable about the Pixel 2, Home speakers, Pixel Buds, and other new products on display. But when it comes time to buy a phone, you\u2019re handed off to people working on behalf of an authorized Verizon reseller. Specifically, it\u2019s this company right here. \nI\u2019m a Verizon customer, and when buying a phone, I generally avoid these resellers and stick to the official, corporate locations. It\u2019s usually a better experience, and at the very least it makes returns a lot easier. If you want to return a Pixel bought at the pop-ups, you\u2019ve got to bring them back to that same pop-up. And if your return period extends to after the temporarily locations close, you\u2019re told to call a phone number to process a return. Yeah... no thanks. \nUpdate: Google has reached out to say that it will reimburse customers who paid extra at its pop-up stores today. \u201cThis was an error, which is now fixed,\u201d a spokesperson writes, adding \u201cSorry for any confusion. We'll be reaching out shortly to reimburse those impacted.\u201d Our original story, which includes details about the reseller, follows. \nBut the worst part of this is that these pop-ups, which are basically Google stores in the minds of visitors, are overcharging people for the new Google phones. The one in Manhattan definitely is, at least. All models of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are marked up by $30. The $649 Pixel 2 is marked up to $680. The 128GB model is $780. 64GB XL 2? $880, and it\u2019s $980 for the 128GB version. \nTo be clear, this is neither the result of sales tax (which would work out to a total of over $700 for the usual price) or a bundled activation fee. Activation fees appear separately on a customer's bill and are not factored into a device's pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pixel 2 is supposed to start at $649, not $680.\nPhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\n\nThis $680 price is also shown on Victra's website \u2014 with the activation fee listed separately. Victra is the Verizon reseller working out of Google's pop-ups.\nApparently they\u2019ll price match the regular rates if you call out this nonsense, but it\u2019s still pretty inexcusable. Not even Verizon itself is charging a penny extra for the Pixels when you buy direct from the carrier. And you\u2019re walking out of here with a Google shopping bag. How is the company okay with this? \n\n\nSame thing is happening in LA. Going back for a refund.

They\u2019ve also got Google\u2019s first-party cases, which (thankfully) don\u2019t seem to be marked up at all. I\u2019d steer clear of the absurd $50 tempered glass screen protector for the 2 XL, though. It\u2019s from Pure Gear and doesn\u2019t carry any \u201cMade for Google\u201d badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel pricing aside, the pop-ups are a pretty great way of checking out Google's new gadgets. \nPhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\n\nLook, Google is free to pursue whatever business deals it wants and go about retail in any way the company pleases. But I\u2019m definitely of the belief that it has made some bad decisions here. These should be unlocked Google Pixel phones sold to you directly by the Google Store. You should be able to get Google\u2019s extended, accidental warranty for the phone at a place that looks like a Google retail shop. But most of all? You shouldn\u2019t be getting scammed out of an extra $30.\nBy the way, the photos in this article were taken with a Pixel 2. What a camera. \n"}
