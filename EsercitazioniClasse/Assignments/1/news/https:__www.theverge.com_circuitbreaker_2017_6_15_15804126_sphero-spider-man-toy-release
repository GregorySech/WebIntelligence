{"title": "Sphero's new Spider-Man toy is like an overly chatty camp counselor", "content": " \nToy robotics company Sphero is building its business around connected play, or the idea of toys that theoretically never age because they\u2019re frequent refreshed by software updates. We\u2019ve seen this idea realized in the company\u2019s BB-8 and Lightning McQueen toys, both of which were designed to accompany Disney movies. Now, Sphero is releasing yet another toy \u2014 a talking Spider-Man \u2014 that continues to expand its connected toy line.\nThe interactive device looks different from anything else Sphero has created, in that it\u2019s stationary and made of a rubber material \u2014 all the company\u2019s other toys are designed to move. Kids also control Spider-Man with voice commands, which is the first time we\u2019ve seen Sphero include that technology.\nIt turns comics into audiobooks\nThe toy itself is unique because it guides kids through comic book storylines, as if Spider-Man were a camp counselor at a bonfire. It talks through the story and gives kids an opportunity to choose what to do next, like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. The toy remembers where kids left off, too, so they can immediately come back to their story wherever they left it. Spider-Man has more than 400 pages-worth of content stored onboard and 100 storylines, which Sphero expects will take months to go through. Again, though, the idea is that Sphero will continuously add stories to Spider-Man\u2019s arsenal.  \nThe Spider-Man toy pairs with phones over Bluetooth, although you don\u2019t need a device to control it. The app lets you manually select a mode, but you can also trigger storytelling or conversation with phrases like, \u201ctell me a story,\u201d or \u201cmake me laugh.\u201d Sphero says Spider-Man neither sends information over the web nor stores data in the app. It\u2019s only looking for its wake-up phrases at which point it\u2019ll respond. This, they say, makes it compliant with COPPA, which protects children\u2019s privacy online.\nGenerally, Spider-Man doesn\u2019t look or act as impressive robotics-wise as Sphero\u2019s prior releases, but it still pushes the toy market forward with voice controls and a more interactive experience. I just wish it could fly across the room. The device is out today for $149.\n\n"}
