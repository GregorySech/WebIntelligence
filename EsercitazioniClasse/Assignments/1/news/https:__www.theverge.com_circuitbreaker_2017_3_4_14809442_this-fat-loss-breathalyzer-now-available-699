{"title": "This fat-loss breathalyzer is now available for $699", "content": " \nLEVL, the device that can tell you how much fat you\u2019re burning by analyzing your breath, is now available to consumers in the Seattle area. The device made its debut way back at CES 2016, and now it\u2019s finally making its way to consumers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LEVLhome works by detecting the amount of acetone in an exhaled breath, which is an indicator of fat burned, and converting that into a quantifiable number on the companion app. The LEVLhome costs $699 for the device, and will cost an extra $49 a month for replacement sensors and calibration gas.\nWhile it will initially only be available to those who live in the Seattle area where the company is headquartered, LEVL says nationwide availability for the LEVLhome will be announced this spring. You can order a LEVLhome from the company\u2019s website today. \n"}
