{"title": "The focus on diversity gained momentum at this year\u2019s New York Comic Con", "content": " \n2017\u2019s entertainment has suggested some marginal progress in diversity, with an increasing trend toward film, TV shows, and anime telling the stories of marginalized groups. There\u2019s growing awareness of how representation affects entertainment, which has lead to, for instance, the whitewashing discussions about Ghost in the Shell and Death Note, or Ed Skrein\u2019s decision to turn down a role in Hellboy, once he learned the character was meant to be of Asian descent. As a celebration of fandom, 2017\u2019s New York Comic Con reflected the year\u2019s trends. It showed the same minute steps being made toward racial and gender equity in entertainment. It also addressed the significant barriers that are left to overcome. \nThis year\u2019s NYCC had a greater focus on inclusive panels. With titles like \u201cGeeks of Color\u201d and \u201cCosplay and Disabilities,\u201d they provided spaces for traditionally neglected groups to feel included in a venue packed with Naruto billboards and costumed Game of Thrones characters. And they helped move the conversation forward by bringing social activists into the spotlight. Some of the featured panelists have been involved in the dialog around representation issues for decades, enacting change at the local level. At Comic Con, they delivered their messages to impressionable young kids dressed as Sailor Moon characters and Harry Potter.\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in the snowball effect.\u201d\nDuring the convention, I sat down with one of these panelists \u2014 Tor Books editor Diana Pho, who came to Comic Con dressed as the Chinese-American character Jubilee from X-Men and moderated three panels on diversity this year. She said she first got involved in fandom as a teenager writing fan fiction for Robert Asprin\u2019s Myth Adventures series. Eventually, she migrated to the internet through dial-up. \nAttending anime conventions felt like a natural extension of Pho\u2019s hobbies, but she noticed how Asian fans, especially Japanese girls, were fetishized by obsessive anime fans who were usually white. Later, her wife introduced her to steampunk and its idealized fantasy version of the Victorian era. But at steampunk panels, Pho kept bringing politics into the discussion. \u201cI'd be the one to be like, \u2018Hey, by the way, you know what else happened during the Victorian era? Slavery and child labor and inequality for women.\u2019\u201d Pho felt that raising those issues helped keep steampunk conventions away from extreme romanticization of an era with its own flaws. Later, her interest in activism grew into a steampunk blog, and from there, Tor Books picked her up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTor books editor and steampunk activist Diana Pho at the New York Comic Con 2017.\n\n\nA lot of Pho\u2019s mission to bring social awareness to fandom starts in the small steps, like sharing stories about what it\u2019s like to live and work as a woman of color in the publishing industry. She says, \u201cIt's great that I'm doing these panels. I'm a strong believer in the snowball effect.\u201d Arguably, that snowball effect has led to the increased diversity discussion, which is no longer dependent on ad-hoc comments from the occasional socially aware panelist.\nOn Saturday evening, Pho ran two back-to-back panels in rooms filled to capacity: \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Our Problematic Faves: Marginalized Fans and Media,\u201d and \u201cWomen of Color Break Out the Books.\u201d In the latter panel, participants discussed how they would ideally remove the obstacles impeding social progress. Pho\u2019s voice cracked several times as she talked about how an academic scholarship let her afford a New York internship that helped her to where she is today. HarperCollins senior book marketing manager Ebony LaDelle agreed that women of color face particular financial constraints and a lack of support structures: \u201cI have colleagues whose parents might help with half their rent. It\u2019s frustrating. You might have to take an unpaid internship, and in order to afford that, you have to be a waitress at night.\u201d\nThe keyword here is accessibility, says video games editor Jes Negr\u00f3n. \u201cIf it costs you $60 each time to come here and do an interview in New York, as a broke college kid, pretty soon, you\u2019ll stop interviewing.\u201d The applicant pool self-selects for a homogeneous crowd of affluent, predominantly white job-seekers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEbony LaDelle speaks at the Women of Color Break Out the Books panel at New York Comic Con 2017.\n\n\nThese barriers help keep women of color out of white-leaning industries like science fiction and fantasy publishing. According to a Lee & Low Books diversity survey published in 2016, 78 percent of the people working in publishing are women and 79 percent are white. At the executive level, the number drops and only 59 percent of employees are women. \u201cSome would argue that we\u2019re rising toward gender equality. Well, no, if you don\u2019t see a lot of women of color in equal numbers,\u201d Pho said. \u201cIf all these white women are still publishing books that appeal to white men the most, or other white audiences, it\u2019s not as progressive as you\u2019d think.\u201d\nThe struggle of entering a majority-white industry also takes a psychological toll on people of color because of the lack of cultural connections and the constant sensation of looking and feeling different. LaDelle elaborated, \u201cYou\u2019re wondering if someone is treating you differently because of the color of your skin. There is this subconscious bias they don\u2019t even realize they have about you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s you, the person next to you\u201d\nSince the leadership at the top tiers are mostly white men, the business decisions that trickle down can be be non-inclusive. For instance, there are quotas imposed on how many books featuring mainly people of color can be promoted or picked up at a particular time, according to LaDelle and Regina Flath, a book cover artist who\u2019s half-Filipina. \u201cIt\u2019s like they have one book about people with color, so they don\u2019t want to have another,\u201d queer author K. Arsenault Rivera said at the panel.\nThere are still initiatives working to turn the tide and signs that things might take a turn for the better. A mentorship program called Representation Matters, started earlier in 2017, has gotten several people of color entry-level jobs in publishing. Literary agent Beth Phelan started the DVpit Twitter event because she wanted pitches written by marginalized people. The hashtag has led to several authors of color getting discovered and landing book deals.\nAll these visibility efforts, including the panels at Comic Con, are contributing to the diversity cause. As Pho puts it, \u201cIt's not just me, it's you, the person next to you, neighbors, and coworkers.\u201d That decentralization of responsibility means the onus is on everyone to promote social change. \u201cThat relieves the pressure. We don't have to have one leader, this one figurehead who will guide the way to save us all,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
