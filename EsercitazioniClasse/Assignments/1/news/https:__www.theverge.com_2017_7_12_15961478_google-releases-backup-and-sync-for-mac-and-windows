{"title": "Google releases Backup and Sync for Mac and Windows", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s Backup and Sync desktop app is now available for download for Mac and Windows after a delay last month. Users now have the power to sync up anything, including photos and videos from cameras, SD cards, and USB devices, instead of their files remaining stuck in one place.\nIt\u2019s a way to protect files and photos by backing them up, as long as they\u2019re in Google Drive and Google Photos, primarily for consumer users. Business users of G Suite are recommended to keep using Google Drive until a business-focused solution called Drive File Stream comes out later this year. People can sign up for Drive File Stream\u2019s early adopter program though.  \nGoogle wrote on its blog, \u201cJust choose the folders you want to back up, and we\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d Backup and Sync is available through Google Drive and Google Photos for download.\n"}
