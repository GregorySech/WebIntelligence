{"title": "Patreon is adding support for WordPress, Slack, and other platforms", "content": " \nPatreon is letting users directly link its payment platform to WordPress, MailChimp, and other services. Today, it\u2019s launching an \u201capp directory\u201d of plugins based on its existing API, along with a developer portal that includes documentation for building new tools. It\u2019s part of a major Patreon expansion in the wake of a $60 million funding round last month, and a step toward making the service a full-fledged payment system, not just a crowdfunding site.\nPatreon VP of business development Brent Horowitz says that around a dozen plugins will be available at launch, and he hopes to have 100 or more available within a year. Some, like the extension for WordPress-powered sites, will replicate basic Patreon functions outside Patreon.com. Patrons can sign up for memberships directly through a private site, and the creator can offer patron-only posts on that site, rather than posting on their Patreon page.\nYouTube is still a major gap in the library\nOther plugins will grant patrons access to members-only message boards or chat channels \u2014 something Patreon already does with gaming-focused chat app Discord. Forum platform Discourse is integrating with Patreon, and Slack support is coming later this year. There are also some uses that will be mostly invisible to patrons. That includes a connection with automation service Zapier, which lets creators do things like instantly add new patrons to mailing lists.\nDevelopers could already work with Patreon\u2019s API, but this makes it easier for any creator to automate steps that they might have performed by hand, and to avoid sending potential patrons away from their site to sign up. Developers, meanwhile, should have access to more resources from Patreon, including better overall support. \u201cWe have more engineers and product resources dedicated to this initiative then we did when those integrations were first built,\u201d says Horowitz.\nThere are still a few obvious gaps here, particularly the lack of full integration with YouTube, where many of the most popular Patreon creators operate. Zapier can automate video sharing, but people won\u2019t be able to sign up for membership directly on YouTube. Any plugin might run up against YouTube\u2019s shifting and poorly explained rules for creators, who currently can\u2019t even advertise campaigns directly on videos until they hit 10,000 views. Nonetheless, Patreon is talking with \u201cessentially everybody that matters\u201d about integration, says Horowitz. \u201cWe think that this is certainly the beginning of larger platforms \u2014 the giant tech companies and those types \u2014 [working] with us on unlocking special experiences for patrons.\u201d\nPatreon\u2019s latest funding round will let the company \u2014 which, despite rapid growth, remains much smaller than similar platforms like Kickstarter \u2014 push further into the mainstream. This hasn\u2019t come without controversy. The latest policy update laid out stricter rules around what Patreon deemed \u201cfringe adult content,\u201d to the consternation of its many erotic entertainers and artists. A spokesperson has since told Engadget that Patreon was only clearing up gray areas in its existing terms of service. But the bigger the platform gets \u2014 and the more places you can find it \u2014 the more it will need to articulate exactly who it\u2019s for.\n"}
