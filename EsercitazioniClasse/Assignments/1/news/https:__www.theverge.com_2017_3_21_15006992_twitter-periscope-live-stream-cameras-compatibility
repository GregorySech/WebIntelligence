{"title": "Twitter starts letting users live stream from more than just their phones", "content": " \nTwitter is expanding the ways to live stream video on Periscope with a new API announced today. Similar functionality was previously available as a part of a limited program started last October, but the new Periscope Producer API will let developers and companies create ways for everyday Twitter (and Periscope) users start live broadcasts from other apps and cameras. Interested developers can apply here.  \nTwitter named four partners who have already been using the beta version of the API, but there\u2019s only one consumer camera so far: the Livestream Mevo. The other three \u2014 Telestream\u2019s Wirecast software, Switchboard Cloud, and Teradek \u2014 are more professional video creation and management solutions.\nMoving live streaming off the phone as Twitter tries to catch Facebook\nThe Mevo was announced at CES 2016, and was also the first non-smartphone camera to work with Facebook Live. The Mevo\u2019s software turns the shot glass-sized camera into a quasi mobile studio solution \u2014 while there\u2019s just one lens, the camera and app let users set up multiple 1080p-sized crops on the full 4K image, and they can switch between these on the fly while live-streaming. So for $399, you can now mimic the look of a multi-camera live-streaming setup on Periscope without buying any professional equipment.\nIn December Twitter started allowing 360-degree live-streaming on Periscope, thanks to an integration with the Insta360 Air camera. Twitter says the new API will likely open this feature up to other spherical cameras on the market. \nPeriscope wasn\u2019t the first notable live-streaming app, but it had a stretch run where it was certainly the most popular. It even helped drive live-streaming pioneer Meerkat completely out of the market. But Facebook Live\u2019s rise in popularity (and a slow path to Twitter integration) left Periscope reaching for users. Facebook also allows users to broadcast live video from different cameras, and so Periscope\u2019s new API is Twitter\u2019s way of trying to make up some of that ground.  \n"}
