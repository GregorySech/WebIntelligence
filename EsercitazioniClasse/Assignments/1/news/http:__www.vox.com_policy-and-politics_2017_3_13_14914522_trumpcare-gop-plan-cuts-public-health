{"title": "CBO confirms that the GOP plan to replace Obamacare would cripple public health", "content": " \nLast week, House Republicans released their plan to replace Obamacare, giving Americans a sense, at long last, of how their health insurance might change under the Trump administration. Today the Congressional Budget Office followed up with an estimate on what would happen if the law is passed, and its findings were grim: 24 million people would lose their coverage by 2026. That\u2019s much larger than anyone anticipated, and it\u2019ll be devastating for many Americans. \nIn its report, the CBO outlined another alarming effect on health: If implemented, the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act would kill the funding that established the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the federal budget\u2019s largest budget allocation for disease prevention, by 2019.\n\u201cFunding under current law [Obamacare] is projected to be $1 billion in 2017 and to rise to $2 billion in 2025 and each year thereafter,\u201d the CBO report says. \u201cCBO estimates that eliminating that funding would reduce direct spending by $9 billion over the 2017-2026 period.\u201d This assessment \u201cfails to take into account that these dollars will have to be replaced through the regular appropriations process,\u201d the American Public Health Association pointed out in a statement, calling this a \u201chealth policy disaster.\u201d \nThe ACA established the Prevention and Public Health Fund with a simple mission: to boost public health money, much of it for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to support activities that keep people from becoming sick. (At a time when more Americans would be gaining insurance, keeping people healthy and out of the health care system carried extra appeal for lawmakers.)\nThe Prevention Fund helps kids and their families get the vaccines they need. It supports programs that reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and lead poisoning in communities. \u201cIt also pays for key elements of the emergency preparedness systems that are in place throughout the nation,\u201d explained John Auerbach, president and CEO of the public health nonprofit the Trust for America\u2019s Health, \u201cincluding the people who respond quickly when there is a weather disaster, a new infectious disease outbreak like Zika or an elevated number of fatal drug overdoses.\u201d \nOver the years, the fund has become a prime target for Republicans, who generally regard public health as paternalistic and have called the program a \u201cslush fund for jungle gyms.\u201d Congress has subjected it to a slew of cuts. So it\u2019s not a surprise that the American Health Care Act plans to sever the fund altogether.\nBut killing that funding is going to have an outsize impact on many of America\u2019s key public health activities. \nIt\u2019ll cripple the Section 317 vaccines program, which has been called \u201cthe backbone of our nation\u2019s immunization infrastructure.\u201d Section 317 ensures that doctors get the vaccination doses they need, helps people who can\u2019t afford vaccines gain access to them, and mobilizes responses to outbreaks such as measles, among other things. Getting rid of the fund will mean Section 317 would lose half its funding, which is frightening at a time when vaccination rates are already down in some states.\nEighty percent of the funding for evidence-based education and health programs prevent heart disease \u2014 the No. 1 cause of death in America \u2014 comes from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, so that\u2019ll disappear, too. So will 100 percent of the funding for programs to reduce the risk of health care\u2013associated infections at hospitals. \nThe CDC will also face a major cut. Over the years, several items in the CDC\u2019s core budget have been shifted over to the fund. With the fund\u2019s disappearance, $890 million (or about 12 percent) of the CDC\u2019s annual budget would be lost.\n\u201cSimply put, without the Prevention Fund the American people will be less healthy and some will die unnecessarily,\u201d said Auerbach. The effects here will be a lot more slow-burning and subtle than the immediate tragedy of an individual losing her insurance. But over the long run, they could be just as devastating.\n"}
