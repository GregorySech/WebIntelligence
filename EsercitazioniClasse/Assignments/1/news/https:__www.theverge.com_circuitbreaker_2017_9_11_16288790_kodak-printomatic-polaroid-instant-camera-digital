{"title": "The Kodak Printomatic is basically the Polaroid Snap with a new coat of paint", "content": " \nThe first instant film camera in years to bear the famous Kodak name and branding was announced today. The Kodak Printomatic is a pocketable digital camera that combines a 10-megapixel sensor with the ability to instantly print 2 x 3-inch sticker photos on non-ink Zink paper.\nWait, haven\u2019t we heard this before? Ah, yes: the Polaroid Snap, which was released in 2015, also shoots 10-megapixel images and prints them on 2 x 3 Zink Paper. The cameras also look cosmetically similar, if not identical. So, what\u2019s going on here? \nWell, since Kodak doesn\u2019t really make its own consumer cameras anymore, the Printomatic is actually being produced by a company called C+A Global, which is just licensing the Kodak name and branding. C+A also licenses Polaroid, and was behind the two-year-old Snap. Both cameras were designed by Silicon Valley firm Ammunition Group, which confirmed to The Verge that the Printomatic is basically the same camera as the Snap, though simplified and rebadged. (The cherry on top of this corporate synergy sundae is that C+A also works with Zink.)\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Snap was fun when we tried it back in early 2016. But this is unmistakably the result of C+A slapping a new coat of paint on a two-year-old idea in hopes of tapping a new vein of nostalgia. It\u2019s also further evidence that these once-great companies have been been reduced to branding that\u2019s as interchangeable and fleeting as a fashion trend. At the very least, that continued reduction has some value; the $69 Printomatic is cheaper than the $90 Pop. \nThe press release for the Kodak Printomatic says that the camera is just the \u201cfirst of the full product lineup to be launched in 2017 and continue into 2018.\u201d C+A did make a more technologically advanced (and, I think, more stylish) version of the digital / print hybrid idea called the Polaroid Pop, which was announced at this year\u2019s CES. So if the company is keen to keep styling one camera to fit two legacy brands, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we someday see a Kodak version of the Pop, too. \nThere\u2019s also some extreme historical irony at play here. Polaroid pioneered the instant film camera in the mid 1900s and, years later, Kodak followed with its own. But Kodak\u2019s version hewed too closely to Polaroid\u2019s patented instant camera tech. The result? Kodak left the instant camera market altogether in the 1980s, and was ordered to pay Polaroid nearly $1 billion in the ensuing legal battle. At least Kodak won\u2019t have to worry about any of that this time around.\n"}
