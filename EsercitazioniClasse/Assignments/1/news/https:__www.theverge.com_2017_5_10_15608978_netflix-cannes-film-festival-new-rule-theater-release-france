{"title": "Netflix\u2019s first two films at Cannes could be its last", "content": " \nNetflix is taking two buzzy features to the Cannes Film Festival this year for the first time \u2014 The Meyerowitz Stories, the latest from indie darling Noah Baumbach, and Okja, the second English-language film from Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-Ho. But a newly announced Cannes rule might make competition difficult for the platform in the future.\nStarting next year, all films that compete at Cannes are required to have a theatrical release in France, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The statement from the film festival doesn\u2019t refer to Netflix directly, instead citing a \u201cnew operator\u201d and \u201cunseen situation until now,\u201d and then emphasizing its own \u201csupport to the traditional mode of exhibition of cinema in France and in the world.\u201d \nnetflix has butted heads with the national federation of french cinemas before\nThe festival\u2019s competition lineup was announced in early April, and backlash against Netflix\u2019s inclusion started almost immediately \u2014 with festival board members and other film producers objecting that Netflix\u2019s streaming-first film release strategy should prohibit it from competing in a festival designed to celebrate theatrical film. \nThe tone of the response has been fairly hostile, particularly from the National Federation of French Cinemas (FNCF), which has taken issue with Netflix\u2019s contorting around theatrical release taxes and fees dating back to the 2015 release of Beasts of No Nation. The film never came to French theaters, as French law requires films to be kept off of streaming services for 36 months after their theatrical release. After the Cannes announcement, the FCNF demanded that Netflix announce whether its submissions would play in French theaters, adding that, if they didn\u2019t, it would \u201ccall into question their nature as a cinematographic work.\u201d\nJust two weeks ago, Netflix said it was considering releasing its Cannes films in arthouses in France for a \u201climited theatrical run, day and date with the films\u2019 release on Netflix,\u201d and somewhat snarkily added \u201csimilar to French exhibitors, we want to continue to contribute to the development and financing of films.\u201d On Wednesday, Cannes announced that whatever negotiations had been underway had fallen through, making the chances that Netflix will opt to hew to the rule in the future look pretty slim.\nThe Cannes Film Festival starts May 17th. Netflix\u2019s submissions will compete against 17 other features for the prestigious Palme d'Or award \u2014 including new work from Todd Haynes (Carol), Michael Haneke (Amour), Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster), Lynne Ramsay (We Need to Talk About Kevin), and Sofia Coppola.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Netflix for comment and will update if we hear back. \n"}
