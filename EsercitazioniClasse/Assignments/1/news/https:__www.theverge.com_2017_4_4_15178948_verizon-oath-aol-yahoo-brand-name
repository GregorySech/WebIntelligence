{"title": "Verizon confirms Oath is coming, but says AOL and Yahoo brands will remain", "content": " \nVerizon has confirmed that it plans to group all of the combined AOL and Yahoo brands together underneath a new name: Oath. The internet had a lot of fun with that one yesterday. But the company is also trying to clarify a few things today, according to an email I received from a spokesperson. For one, there will be no Oath Mail. Yahoo Sports isn\u2019t becoming Oath Sports. The Yahoo and AOL names aren\u2019t actually going anywhere., you see. At least not in the near term.\n\u201c[The] AOL and Yahoo brands will not only remain, but a core tenet of Oath will be to deeply invest in growing those brands. Oath is the umbrella and the portfolio of brands will comprise Oath \u2014 a house of brands structure.\u201d\nThe brands live inside Oath, the house.\nHere is a website about Oath, the house of brands. The website notes that \u201csomeone snitched\u201d about the name before Verizon was ready to announce it, though AOL\u2019s CEO Tim Armstrong tried to make the best of things. \n\n\nBillion+ Consumers, 20+ Brands, Unstoppable Team. #TakeTheOath.

I think we\u2019re in a very good position to launch what I would say is the largest house of trusted brands in the digital space.\u201d\nThe following text is pasted directly from the AOL spokesperson\u2019s email:\n\nA few things:\nOath is a values-led company, committed to building brands people love.\nBy definition, an Oath is a commitment. The name reflects who we are, what we stand for, and the promises we make to each other, our consumers, our customers and our partners.\nOath\u2019s values are shared commitments that unite our global community of technologists, storytellers, journalists, videographers, creators and data scientists.\nWhy brands?  Brands connect with people across devices and span digital to physical worlds; Brands are trusted and safe; Brands drive innovation; Brand love spans generations; People read, watch, buy, share and refer the brands they love\u2019 Brands drive conversation, create change and start cultural movements; Brands make our lives better. Brands change the world.\n\nI added the emphasis on those last two sentences. A spokesperson said \u201cmore to come this summer\u201d when \u201cthe fun really begins\u201d and \u201cwhen we officially launch Oath.\u201d\n"}
