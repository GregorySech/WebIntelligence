{"title": "Twitter now lets you mute notifications from people who don\u2019t follow you", "content": " \nTwitter has announced new advanced filters so you can snooze notifications on accounts that don\u2019t follow you. Recently, Twitter updated so you can mute accounts that have a default profile photo, those without a confirmed email address / phone number, and accounts you don\u2019t follow \u2014 but not the other way around.\n\n\nNow you have even more control over your notifications. Mute accounts that don't follow you, new accounts, and more. https://t.co/UapP6DtTtY pic.twitter.com/RcBQGx219k\u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) July 10, 2017\n\n\n\nTo set the filters on the web browser version of Twitter, just go to Notifications, click on Settings, and check the boxes of your preferred filters. In iOS and Android, these advanced filters can be found on the Notifications timeline under the gear icon. \nThere still isn\u2019t a way to mass unfollow all the people who aren\u2019t following you back. Twitter says this is to prevent the potential abuse of mass unfollowing people and then following other accounts continuously, until an account amasses a large amount of followers and a low following count. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s update won\u2019t erase trolls and abusive behavior, but at the very least Twitter is hoping to reduce the noise.\n\n"}
