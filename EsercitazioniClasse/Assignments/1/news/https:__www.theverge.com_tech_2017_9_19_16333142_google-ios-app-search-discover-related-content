{"title": "Google\u2019s iOS app now recommends articles related to what you\u2019re reading", "content": " \nToday, Google is debuting a new feature for its namesake mobile app on iOS that will recommend articles related to what you\u2019re currently reading.\nNow, as you\u2019re on a webpage using the app, you should be able to swipe up to see additional articles that could be of interest. It\u2019s built into the existing bottom bar that already allows you to start a fresh search or share what you\u2019re viewing. (I was not able to swipe up and access the recommendations at the time of publishing, but Google could still be rolling it out.)\nOnce you swipe up on the bottom bar, a lightbox-esque display appears with automatically populated related content, without having to do any additional searches. Say you\u2019re looking for the perfect way to roast a chicken: the app might show you other recipes or methods of preparation, which can then be accessed by a single tap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\nNo matter if you\u2019re in a rabbit hole of reading about photography techniques or looking for where to vacation next, the new function could help with finding what you\u2019re looking for an easier and quicker process. As of now, this search and discover feature is only available in the US on iOS. You have to be within the Google app to see it, though, so if you\u2019re browsing with Safari, it won\u2019t appear.\nGoogle has been working on bolstering user personalization in its app in recent months, also introducing a news feed based on your search history and topics you choose to follow.\n"}
