{"title": "NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft is about to plunge between Saturn and its rings \u2014 before spiraling into the planet", "content": " \nFor the last 13 years, a NASA spacecraft the size of a school bus has been whirling around Saturn, collecting data and snapping mesmerizing images of the ringed planet and its icy moons. That vehicle is Cassini, and its exploration of Saturn has led to some of the biggest discoveries ever made about the worlds in our Solar System. But as accomplished as this spacecraft is, it\u2019s time for its life to end: this weekend, Cassini will change course and embark on a new path around Saturn \u2014 one that will eventually lead to the probe\u2019s destruction.\nCassini\u2019s demise is an important part of NASA\u2019s mission plan. After all this time, the vehicle is running low on fuel, which means NASA will eventually lose the ability to maneuver it. And the agency doesn\u2019t want to risk Cassini going somewhere it shouldn\u2019t. Saturn\u2019s ocean moon Enceladus and the moon Titan, which is covered in lakes of methane, could be home to alien life. If left unchecked, Cassini could potentially wander too close to these moons and contaminate them with Earth microbes, ruining our chances of finding pristine extraterrestrial organisms elsewhere in the Solar System. The safest bet is to send the spacecraft hurtling toward Saturn, where it will burn and break apart.\nThe safest bet is to send the spacecraft hurtling toward Saturn, where it will burn and break apart\nBut before that happens, there\u2019s still a lot Cassini will do. Early Saturday morning, the vehicle will fly close by Titan, a move that will send the spacecraft plunging between Saturn and its rings. That will put Cassini in its closest orbit yet around the planet, bringing it within roughly 1,840 miles of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. The probe will complete 22 full orbits at this altitude, one every seven days \u2014 a phase known as the Grand Finale. \nAt this time, the probe will be getting an up-close taste of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, as well as some of the most precise measurements of the planet\u2019s magnetic and gravitational fields. It\u2019s key science that wouldn\u2019t happen unless Cassini was on a course for destruction. \u201cThe emotional response runs full spectrum,\u201d Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager, tells The Verge. \u201cYou come in and look at the images we\u2019re doing and the excitement of the science coming up. It\u2019s a great sense of pride, but then after that it\u2019s going to be over.\u201d In fact, in mid-September, the planet\u2019s gravitational pull will eventually draw Cassini inward, and the spacecraft will smash into the world it has been exploring.\n\nWhatever Cassini finds during the Grand Finale will add to what has already been an impressive mission in the outer Solar System. Launched in 1997, Cassini spent seven years traveling through space before inserting itself into Saturn\u2019s orbit in July 2004. And since then, the spacecraft has boasted one major discovery after the next. The probe is the reason we know there\u2019s a liquid ocean underneath the surface of Enceladus, for instance, and that this water periodically erupts through the moon\u2019s crust in the form of plumes. Just recently, NASA announced that Cassini had found hydrogen in those plumes \u2014 a strong indicator of hot spots on the moon\u2019s ocean floor. That means Enceladus could be a prime place for alien life to thrive.\nThe spacecraft has boasted one major discovery after the next\nCassini was also responsible for carrying a lander to Saturn known as the Huygens probe, which traveled to the surface of Titan in 2005. Built by the European Space Agency, this probe was a big motivation for sending Cassini to Saturn in the first place. Scientists were super curious about Titan, a cloudy moon with an intriguing chemical makeup and suspected methane lakes. \u201cIt has just the right chemicals that you might imagine life needing here on Earth,\u201d Scott Edgington, the deputy project scientist for Cassini, tells The Verge. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t see through the surface or see through the weather patterns.\u201d The Huygens probe gave scientists their first up-close look at the surface of Titan.\nTo study Saturn, Cassini has taken an incredibly intricate path around the planet. The spacecraft has shifted orbits numerous times, in order to fly close by Saturn\u2019s rings or one of the planet\u2019s many moons. The goal was also to cover as much territory as possible while trying to conserve Cassini\u2019s propellant. So Cassini\u2019s path looks a bit messy. \u201cImagine a big ball of yarn that\u2019s all knotted,\u201d says Edgington. \u201cIn order to satisfy everyone\u2019s requests, you have to come up with these orbits that look complicated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the orbits Cassini will have done at Saturn\nNASA\n\n\nActually, tomorrow will be just a routine maneuver for Cassini. It\u2019s the spacecraft\u2019s 127th \u2014 and last \u2014 flyby of Titan. But Cassini will also use Titan\u2019s gravity to shift into its final orbit between Saturn and the planet\u2019s rings, something that\u2019s never been done before. That part doesn\u2019t necessarily worry the mission team, though. \u201cWe have no doubt that Titan will put us into that gap,\u201d says Maize. \u201cWhat we have less certainty about is what\u2019s in that gap.\u201d\nCassini will also use Titan\u2019s gravity to shift into its final orbit\nThe region between Saturn and its rings has never been explored before, and there\u2019s some uncertainty about what Cassini will encounter there. There\u2019s always a chance that Cassini could be knocked out by a large enough particle coming from the rings. And the team won\u2019t know right away if the spacecraft has survived its first \u201cring crossing.\u201d Cassini will make its first pass at around 5AM ET on April 26th, collecting data and using its antenna as a shield against any particles. The spacecraft will then send a message to Earth nearly a day later. The team won\u2019t get that \u201cI\u2019m still alive\u201d message until 3:10AM ET on April 27th. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be waiting for that signal,\u201d says Maize.\nIf it survives, Cassini will do the same orbit all over again \u2014 about once a week until September 15th. During these trips, Cassini will be directly sampling Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, as well as getting more precise measurements about the planet\u2019s mass. Scientists don\u2019t really know, for instance, how much Saturn\u2019s rings weigh versus how much the planet weighs. But traveling in the ring gap will allow Cassini to better separate the two measurements. And the probe will also be sampling something called ring rain \u2014 particles that escape from Saturn\u2019s rings and flow into the planet itself. This will give scientists an even better understanding of what the rings are made of.\n\nBut as Cassini makes each orbit around Saturn, it crosses Titan\u2019s orbit every time. And that pushes Cassini a little bit \u2014 either closer to the rings or deeper into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. During the final five orbits, Titan will push Cassini quite close to the atmosphere, and there\u2019s a possibility that the mission team will have to use its last bits of propellant to slightly adjust course and keep the vehicle afloat. But that will be it. At some point, Saturn\u2019s gravity will become too much and Cassini will make its death dive. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will be taking bets on when the last signal will be heard from Cassini,\u201d says Edgington, who added that the moment would be very emotional for everyone involved too. \u201c[The spacecraft] has been home to me for 15 plus years now.\u201d\n\u201cCassini will leave a legacy that is going to influence our exploration of the outer planets for a long time to come.\u201d\nThat reality is still nearly five months away, though, so it\u2019s not time to mourn the spacecraft just yet. Plus, once Cassini is gone, there\u2019ll still be a lot of data to analyze. Edgington expects that work to continue for many years, maybe even longer than the spacecraft has been exploring Saturn. There\u2019s also a lot of incentive to send something else to the planetary system now. Cassini\u2019s discoveries at Enceladus and Titan have just made the moons even more tantalizing places to search for alien life, proving that habitable worlds don\u2019t necessarily have to look like Earth. \u201cCassini will leave a legacy that is going to influence our exploration of the outer planets for a long time to come,\u201d says Edgington. \n\n"}
