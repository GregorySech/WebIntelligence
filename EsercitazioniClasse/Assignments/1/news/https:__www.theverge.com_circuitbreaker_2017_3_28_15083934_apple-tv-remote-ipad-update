{"title": "Apple\u2019s TV Remote app now works on iPad too", "content": " \nApple has updated its Apple TV app with iPad support, bringing TV controls, chapter selection, and captions to its bigger screen. The 1.1 update also lets you use Siri to control your Apple TV viewing, but not from the iPad\u2019s regular home screen \u2014 instead, you can use voice commands by holding a microphone button on the app\u2019s UI to search for, select, pause, and play your media.\nIt\u2019s taken quite a while for the company to bring Apple TV Remote capabilities to iPad. Apple SVP Eddy Cue originally teased the software back in 2015, saying it would be arriving in early 2016. In reality, it didn\u2019t hit the iPhone until last August, where it served as a more advanced and feature-rich version of the physical remote that shipped with Apple TV boxes. They\u2019re useful for regular viewers, who won\u2019t now have to fumble for tiny remotes, but both iPhone and iPad variants of the app still don\u2019t let you watch Apple TV while on the move.\n"}
