{"title": "Nokia\u2019s legendary 3310 rumored to return at MWC", "content": " \nThe Nokia 3310 is one of the most iconic cellphones of the early mobile age. It\u2019s known for its nearly indestructible design, indefatigable battery life, and Snake II \u2014 and it might be making a modern-day comeback. The news comes from notable phone leaker Evan Blass, who reports over at VentureBeat that HMD Global \u2014 the Finnish company that licensed the rights to produce Nokia phones \u2014 will be announcing a relaunch of the classic 3310 phone at MWC that will allegedly cost just \u20ac59 (roughly $62.61). \nAlong with the rumored 3310 remake, Nokia has already teased new Android phones for MWC, in addition to the currently China-only Nokia 6 that was announced late last year. According to Blass, those will be the Nokia 5 and Nokia 3, two more midrange devices running Android Nougat and rumored to cost \u20ac199 (roughly $210.87) and \u20ac149 (roughly $157.89), respectively. The Nokia 5 is said to have a 5.2-inch 720p screen, 2GB of RAM, and a 12-megapixel camera, along with the same Snapdragon 430 processor as the 6. Less is known about the Nokia 3, except that it\u2019s meant to be the budget model of the line. \nIf correct, those specs are a bit of a disappointment for anyone looking for a flagship Nokia device, as it would make the 5 a step down from the already midrange 6, which has a 1080p, 5.5-inch display, 4GB of RAM, and 16-megapixel camera for \u20ac249 (roughly $263.85). \nWe\u2019ll find out if resurrection of the 3310 is real, along with confirmation of these  rumored Android devices, when Nokia and HMD Global have their formal event at MWC on February 26th. \n"}
