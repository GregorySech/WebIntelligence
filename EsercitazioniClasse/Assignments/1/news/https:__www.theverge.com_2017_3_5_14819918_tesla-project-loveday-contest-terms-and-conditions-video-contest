{"title": "A letter from a 10-year-old inspired Tesla to launch a video contest", "content": " \nTesla launched a video contest for fans of the brand, with the opportunity for their work to be promoted by the company, and a chance to attend a product launch. While the contest has a heartwarming origin, it\u2019s worth examining the contest\u2019s rules and to think twice before hitting the Submit button. \nOn March 1st, a father passed along a letter from his daughter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The letter is sweet: the fifth grader suggested that because Tesla doesn\u2019t put together its own advertisements, it should run a contest to find the best one from the company\u2019s fans. Musk said on Twitter that he liked the idea, and that the company would do it. And it is: Tesla just launched Project Loveday, a contest to find the best 90 second, fan-made commercial.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla\n\n\nThe contest will run through May 8th, according to the Terms and Conditions, in which users can upload their videos and submit the link to the company through a form. Videos have to be 90 seconds or less, have to relate to Tesla or SolarCity\u2019s products or its \u201cmission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy,\u201d and must be suitable for all ages. No violence, nudity, or swearing.  \nOnce submitted, a panel of judges will select 10 winning submissions, which it\u2019ll share on social media. Three of the top scoring submissions will \u201creceive additional promotion,\u201d and a grand prize winner will \u201cbe invited to and introduced at a future Tesla product launch event,\u201d with the company picking up the tab for travel and accommodations. \nOnce you click the submit button, Tesla gets to use your video, in any way it wants\nIn submitting their video however, users sign away a bunch of rights to their work. They grant Tesla a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use the video in any way that the it sees fit, even in \u201ctechnology now known or later developed.\u201d It\u2019s not just your video that it can use: the company can also use your name and likeness perpetually. Tesla has since updated the terms and conditions to remove perpetually from the likeness clause. \nThe legal language is pretty typical for these sorts of contests, but it means that even if your video isn\u2019t selected as a winner, Tesla could conceivably use it for marketing at some point in the future.\nThat might not bother some people, but similar contests have caused some controversy. It can be seen as a way for the company to advertise without having to actually pay the creators for it. A similar situation arose when Amtrak ran a contest for a writer\u2019s residency onboard their trains a couple of years ago. Then, a number of writers pointed out that the contest could be used as a way for the company to simply get some cheap ad copy. \nUpdate March 5th, 2:45PM ET: Reached for comment, a Tesla spokesperson noted that the company has updated the terms and conditions to address the long-term issues, and that the company intends to only use the rights for this particular project.\n\n"}
