For Lockman, who\u2019s the emergency services manager for Tulare county in California\u2019s Central Valley, monitoring the flooding is an exercise in irony. The rain clouds overhead and mud under his tires remind him that while much of California is drenched in water, wells in his patch of the south Central Valley are still bone dry. \nDoes that mean that the drought is finally over?\nDespite all the news about a series of near-biblical storms pummeling the state, California has been in the grips of a devastating, record-setting drought for the past five years. The snowpack had all but disappeared, more than a million acres of agricultural fields lay idle, and 66 million trees died. But in the last week, over a foot of rain has been reported at weather stations across the state, and reservoirs are reaching \u2014 even exceeding \u2014 historic levels. Does that mean that the drought is finally over?\nIt depends on how you define drought, Jeanine Jones, the interstate resources manager for California\u2019s Department of Water Resources, tells The Verge. If you\u2019re looking at precipitation, plant health, and soil moisture, then yes \u2014 the drought looks to be over for the majority of the state, the National Drought Mitigation Center reports. But, Jones adds, \u201cWhen you think about drought and impacts, it\u2019s really at the local scale where you need to look.\u201d \n\n\nDrone video captures the extensive flooding in San Jose, California https://t.co/gvI3qZyJiV pic.twitter.com/xWBvOhNpk5\u2014 CNN (@CNN) February 23, 2017\n\n\n\nWhile some communities are now well-hydrated \u2014 or possibly over-hydrated \u2014 others are still struggling to find enough to drink. That\u2019s because the surface water gushing through rivers and rushing into reservoirs is only one fraction of California\u2019s water supply. The other main source is groundwater, which is the water stored in underground aquifers. Groundwater contributes between 40 and 60 percent of the state\u2019s water supply, depending on how dry the year is. Some communities beyond the reach of city water utilities completely rely on water drawn from wells. \n\u201cRain and snowfall are like income, and snow and water in our reservoirs and rivers are our checking account,\u201d says Jay Famiglietti, a senior water scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But groundwater, Famiglietti says, is more like a retirement account: it\u2019s what the state depends on when income inevitably dries out. \nCalifornia is quickly tapping out this resource\nUnfortunately, California is quickly tapping out this resource. In the Central Valley, which contributes around 8 percent of the food produced in the US, people have sucked so much water out of underground aquifers that in some places the land has dropped by nearly four feet. In Tulare county, as water available for irrigation slowed to a trickle, farmers drilled into the underground aquifers to pump water for their fields.\n\u201cSo essentially, more straws were being added to the punchbowl, and the punchbowl wasn\u2019t being refilled,\u201d Lockman says. So the punchbowl went dry, along with the wells providing water to more than 1,500 households. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia reservoir levels February 22nd, 2017.\nGraphs by CA DWR\n\n\n\nEven families with working wells can\u2019t always drink the water \u2014 chemicals from fertilizers and sewage concentrate in the remaining water as the well dries. That\u2019s why more than 1,800 homes in Tulare county rely on deliveries of bottled drinking water, as well as nonpotable water dispensed into massive 5,000-gallon tanks. These deliveries cost the state $650,000 each month. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not a lasting solution, to have a water tank in your front yard. That\u2019s expensive for the county and the state,\u201d says Jenny Rempel, director of education for a nonprofit organization called Community Water Center, which is working with the state and the county to figure out a better plan. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating to have people around the state saying the drought is over, and to still have a dry well and no lasting solution.\u201d\nFor residents living close enough to the city of Porterville, a lasting solution is on the horizon. So far, 51 homes have been connected to Porterville\u2019s municipal water system, and there are plans to connect another 800. But there are people living in more remote areas who aren\u2019t close enough to be rescued by the city\u2019s pipes, Lockman says. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not a lasting solution, to have a water tank in your front yard.\u201d\nLong-term, the state needs plans to manage its groundwater better. In 2014, Governor Jerry Brown signed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act into law. But water managers have until 2040 to implement more sustainable practices, including using the best available science to create a water budget and monitor water use. That won\u2019t help people who have dry wells now.  \nNeither will the recent storms, although efforts to pump or dribble stormwater runoff back into the aquifers may help. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to take more than one wet year,\u201d Laura Feinstein, a research scientist with the Pacific Institute, told The Verge. Probably, a lot more. \u201cI don\u2019t know if those wells are going to come back, period.\u201d \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-potable water tank.\nPhoto by Tulare County OES\n\n\n\nLockman worries that as the drought lets up, there will be less pressure to come up with permanent solutions for the residents of Tulare County who still rely on water deliveries and massive water tanks of undrinkable water in their front yard. \u201cNow that it\u2019s not in their face anymore, it\u2019s kind of becoming a less glamorous, and less pressing issue as the drought fades away,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern for us.\u201d\nThe truth is, there\u2019s a greater demand for water than California could ever supply, Feinstein says. Unless long-term water conservation measures are enacted, Californians will be feeling drought\u2019s impacts for a long time. \u201cWe live in a perpetual state of not having as much water as people would like to have,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t resolved by any number of wet years.\u201d \n"}
