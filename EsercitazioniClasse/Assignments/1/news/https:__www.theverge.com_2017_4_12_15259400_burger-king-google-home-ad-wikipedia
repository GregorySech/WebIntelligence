{"title": "Burger King\u2019s new ad forces Google Home to advertise the Whopper", "content": " \nBurger King is unveiling a horrible, genius, infuriating, hilarious, and maybe very poorly thought-out ad today that\u2019s designed to intentionally set off Google Homes and Android phones.\nThe 15-second ad features someone in a Burger King uniform leaning into the camera before saying, \u201cOK Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d\nFor anyone with a Google Home near their TV, that strangely phrased request will prompt the speaker to begin reading the Wikipedia entry for the Whopper. It\u2019s a clever way of getting viewers\u2019 attention, but it\u2019s also a really quick way of getting on viewers\u2019 nerves \u2014 just look at the reactions people had when ads accidentally triggered voice assistants in the past.\nBurger King\u2019s ad relies on Wikipedia, which is maybe not a good idea\nWhile Burger King is far from the first to recognize that it\u2019s possible to mess with someone else\u2019s smart speaker, it\u2019s certainly the first to put it into a widely run ad campaign. The spot is supposed to begin running in prime-time slots across the US today on networks including History, Spike, Comedy Central, MTV, E!, and Bravo, and it will air during Adult Swim, The Tonight Show, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.\nGoogle wasn\u2019t involved in the ad\u2019s creation. That means this isn\u2019t an expansion of Google\u2019s ad tests (people weren\u2019t happy when Google built a Beauty and the Beast ad into the speaker), but it also leads to some real issues for Burger King. For one, it has to use weird phrasing \u2014 \u201cWhat is the Whopper burger?\u201d \u2014 because that\u2019s the query that actually gets the result it wants. Asking \u201cWhat is a Whopper?\u201d gets you the definition of the word \u201cwhopper.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s the bigger problem: Google gets its explanation of the Whopper from Wikipedia. And as we all know, anyone\u2019s free to edit Wikipedia.\nIt actually looks like Burger King went and edited the Whopper entry ahead of this ad being run. For almost a decade, Wikipedia\u2019s page for the Whopper began with more or less the same sentence: \u201cThe Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's.\u201d\nBurger King\u2019s marketing chief seems to have edited Wikipedia to improve the ad\nBut last week, that first line \u2014 the only line that Google Home reads \u2014 was changed to: \u201cThe Whopper is a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100 percent beef with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun.\u201d That certainly sounds like ad copy.\nAnd all evidence suggests Burger King is behind the edit. The line was first added by someone with the username \u201cFermachado123,\u201d which appears to be the username of Burger King\u2019s marketing chief, Fernando Machado. He uses the same name on Instagram and an almost identical name on Twitter.\nA press representative for the company stopped responding when asked about the edit. Wikipedia specifically asks that editors \u201cavoid shameless self-promotion\u201d while making changes, and this very much seems to break the rule.\nRelying on Wikipedia also opens up one other problem: anyone can edit it. The Verge modified the Whopper entry briefly, and Google Home began speaking the updated text only minutes later.\nSmart speakers keep getting triggered by accident\nWith this ad airing nationally, Burger King is opening the door for an editing war \u2014 and it risks having a malicious editor make the Google Home say something inappropriate when explaining the Whopper.\nThose risks will certainly make for an interesting, if frustrating, ad campaign.\nBurger King is taking advantage of something here that\u2019s been happening for months: commercials, news anchors, and other voices on TV keep triggering the Google Home, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa, by accident. (\u201cOK Google\u201d could trigger some Android phones, too, though Android has an option to only respond to a specific voice.) In one instance, a news report led to Alexas ordering dollhouses.\nThe whole thing seems avoidable, but so far, Google and Amazon haven\u2019t added voice-recognition to their smart speakers. Until that changes, these accidents are going to keep happening \u2014 and other advertisers willing to risk annoying you may see an opportunity.\nUpdate April 12th, 3:35PM ET: Google appears to have intervened and stopped the Home from responding to Burger King\u2019s commercial. The Whopper\u2019s Wikipedia page has also been reverted to its pre-ad state, and the page has been locked amid an editing war.\n"}
