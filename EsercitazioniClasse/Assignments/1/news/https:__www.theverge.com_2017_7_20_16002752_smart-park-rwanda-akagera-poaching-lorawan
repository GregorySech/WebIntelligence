{"title": "This African park has a high-tech plan to combat poachers", "content": " \nSecurity has long been a major concern at wildlife reserves in Africa, where rhino and elephant populations have been decimated by poachers in recent years. But a park in Rwanda is betting on a new networking technology to change that.\nThis week, Rwanda\u2019s Akagera National Park launched a new system that allows park rangers to monitor animals, visitors, and equipment in real-time. Developed by the Dutch conservation organizations ShadowView and Internet of Life, the so-called \u201csmart park\u201d system is based on a  Long Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) \u2014 a low-bandwidth, low-power networking technology that can blanket large areas at relatively low costs. \nLoRaWAN technology has already been used to develop internet of things (IoT) networks in Amsterdam and other \u201csmart cities;\u201d the groups behind the smart park think it could help keep poachers off protected lands, as well. Unlike easily interceptable radio frequencies, commonly used to track animals in other parks, the smart park\u2019s signals are sent on a closed network across multiple frequencies, making the network more difficult to access. And LoraWAN systems are far less expensive than satellite-based tracking, offering an extra advantage to cash-strapped parks. As the system evolves, it could also provide a valuable source of real-time data to help managers and rangers respond to incidents across the 433-square-mile park, where 3G and 4G connections are unreliable.  \n\n\n\n\nSo far, animal tracking technology has been something of a double-edged sword. Parks and scientists have used radio signals to track threatened species, but a paper published earlier this year warned that poachers may be using VHF receivers to intercept such signals. Poachers in India, the study noted, tried to hack GPS trackers that were placed on Bengal tigers. Tim van Dam, the founder of Internet of Life, says the smart park system would be far more secure because its signals are sent across frequencies that constantly change, and the data sent across it is encrypted.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to create is like a Jurassic Park, but to keep the bad guys out and without the dinosaurs, of course,\u201d says ShadowView founder Laurens de Groot. \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do is make everything measurable inside the park. And when you know that information, you can predict where things might be happening, and you can plan ahead and make the right decision on how to protect certain areas.\u201d\nThe LoRaWAN network is created from gateways within 12 towers placed at high-elevation points around the park. One hundred solar-powered sensors placed within the park send constant signals to the gateways, which are then relayed to a central control room where officials can track their location in real-time. (The system can be scaled up to incorporate 100,000 sensors, according to van Dam.) The sensors can be used to monitor the location of tourist vehicles and park staff, or to check the status of electric fences and other infrastructure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll data collected by the system is sent to a server in a control room. \nShadowView\n\n\nVan Dam, whose organization installed a smaller version of its smart park in Tanzania last year,  says the next step will be to place the sensors on animals, which is \u201ca whole different ballgame, because every animal needs a different approach.\u201d But he notes that the sensors are small enough to be placed inside a rhino\u2019s horn or under its skin. \nSuch sensors could also collect valuable data for researchers, though van Dam says his organization\u2019s immediate goal is to combat poaching. Although African populations of the black and white rhino have rebounded in recent years, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), they remain under threat from poachers. African elephants are under similar threat, with populations dropping from 3 to 5 million at the beginning of the 20th century to about 415,000 today, according to the WWF. Both rhino horn and ivory elephant tusks are highly valued on the black market in Asia. \n\u201cResearch is really important, of course, but this is a war,\u201d van Dam says. \u201cWe will be generating really valuable data for research, but this is not the primary focus of the system,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cNo technology is a single panacea to preventing crime.\u201d\nFaye Cuevas, chief of staff of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), says the smart park system \u201clooks very sophisticated and can have an important role in improving wildlife security,\u201d though she cautions that \u201cno technology is a single panacea to preventing crime and keeping wildlife service rangers safe in their mission to protect wildlife.\u201d Cuevas, who leads the IFAW\u2019s anti-poaching program in Kenya, said in an email that the value of the system depends on how its data is analyzed, and \u201cthat type of analysis takes human eyeballs and algorithms to integrate the threat picture with the data being collected.\u201d   \nVan Dam and de Groot hope to eventually incorporate live video feeds in the network at Akagera, which is home to the African elephant, black rhinoceros, cape buffalo, African lion, and African leopard \u2014 animals collectively referred to as the \u201cbig five\u201d because of their high desirability among big game hunters. And although they acknowledge that poachers will continue their efforts to infiltrate national parks and reserves, whether through corruption or technical means, they hope that the smart park system can at least allow authorities to stay one step ahead.     \n\u201cMost of the time, in the Western world, we\u2019re chasing the guys who are already ahead of us with new technology,\u201d says de Groot, a former police officer. \u201cIn Africa, in these parks, we have an opportunity, with the technology we\u2019re using, to stay ahead of the bad guys.\u201d\n\u201cSo they might come up with a solution to avoid our technology, but hopefully by then we\u2019ll have something else in place.\u201d\n\n\n"}
