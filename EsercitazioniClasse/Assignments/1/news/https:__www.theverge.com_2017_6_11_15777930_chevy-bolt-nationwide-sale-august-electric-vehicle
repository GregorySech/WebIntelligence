{"title": "The Chevy Bolt will go on sale nationwide in August", "content": " \nGeneral Motors began selling its electric Chevy Bolt at the end of 2016 in California and Oregon, with a wider rollout planned for the spring of 2017. The company has confirmed that the vehicle will be available nationwide in August, according to Automotive News. \nThat\u2019s slightly earlier than originally thought: GM planned to start selling the car nationwide in September. Chevrolet's marketing director for cars and crossovers, Steve Majoros, told reporters that dealers can now begin placing orders for the car, which will arrive by August. \nChevy delivered its first Bolt in December, and has gradually expanded sales to over a half-dozen additional states this spring. Majoros explained that the slower rollout has been to help control demand for the vehicle: \u201cWe think we're at the right level of sufficient inventory. We can keep feeding where there's a stronghold of sales.\"\nThe $30,000 (after a federal tax credit) car has an EPA-estimated range of 238 miles with a full charge, and is significantly cheaper than comparable electric vehicles. By moving its national sales up, Chevy will get even more of a head start on rival EV maker Tesla, which will release its Model 3 sometime in 2018.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nLiving with the Chevy Bolt in the real world\n\n\n"}
