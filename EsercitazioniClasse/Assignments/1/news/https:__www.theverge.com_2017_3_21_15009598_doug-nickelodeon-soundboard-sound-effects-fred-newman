{"title": "Watch an interview with the man who created the sound effects in Nickelodeon\u2019s Doug", "content": " \nFred Newman is the voice actor responsible for most of the sound effects in Nickelodeon\u2019s Doug, including the theme song, and he\u2019s also the subject of Great Big Story\u2019s most recent great big story. In the video interview above, Newman discusses how he soundtracked the world of Doug Funnie using only his mouth.\nThroughout the series, Newman also voiced characters like Doug\u2019s friend Skeeter, the frontman of The Beets, whose vocals were apparently inspired by Sting, and even Doug\u2019s dog Porkchop. \u201cI did a lot of dogs in movies,\u201d Newman says. \nAs AV Club points out, Great Big Story also created an interactive Doug Soundboard, where you can click around and hear Newman in action. Like a synth of nostalgia, there\u2019s a button for that immediately recognizable breathy beatbox, a \u201cKiller Tofu\u201d riff, and the superhero-summoning Quail Call.\n"}
