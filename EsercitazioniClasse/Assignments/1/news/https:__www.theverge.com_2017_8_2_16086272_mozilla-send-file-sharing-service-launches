{"title": "Mozilla\u2019s Send is basically the Snapchat of file sharing", "content": " \nMozilla has launched a new website that makes it really easy to send a file from one person to another. The site is called Send, and it\u2019s basically the Snapchat of file sharing: after a file has been downloaded once, it disappears for good.\nThat might sound like a gimmick, but it underscores what the site is meant for. It\u2019s designed for quick and private sharing between two people \u2014 not for long-term hosting or distributing files to a large group.\nFiles are encrypted and disappear after one download or 24 hours\nThough cloud hosting and local services like AirDrop have made sharing files much easier than it used to be, it can still be frustrating to get someone a file. Email attachments often cap out at 20MB or so. And while you can add something to a storage service like Dropbox, it\u2019s then sitting there taking up space, with no indication of whether the file has been downloaded yet and is safe to remove.\n\nSend gets around all of that. It supports files up to 1GB, and after uploading something, it\u2019ll give you a link to send to someone else. That link will expire once they\u2019ve downloaded it or once 24 hours have passed. So someone else\u2019s procrastination is really your biggest limitation here. Files are also encrypted as they\u2019re uploaded, and Mozilla says it \u201cdoes not have the ability to access the content of your encrypted file.\u201d\nMozilla is classifying Send as an experiment for now, so it\u2019s possible that the site won\u2019t be around forever. But the service already seems useful. And if it catches on, maybe it\u2019ll stick around as a way to keep sending stuff.\n"}
