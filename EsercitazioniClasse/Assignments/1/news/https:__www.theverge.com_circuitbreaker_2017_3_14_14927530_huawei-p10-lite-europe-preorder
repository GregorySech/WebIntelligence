Only the Italy-based online retailer Monclick has it for sale, as first reported by HDBlog. The listing says the phone will be available starting on April 11th.\nWe don\u2019t have a photo of the device, but we do have an idea of its specs:\n\nAndroid Nougat\n5.2-inch Full HD display\nOcta-core CPU\n4GB RAM, 32GB internal storage\n12-megapixel rear-facing camera\nSingle SIM slot\n\nIt\u2019ll be available in gold, black, and white, according to the various listings, and will cost \u20ac349, or $379.\nHuawei introduced its P10 and P10 Plus at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. The Lite likely won\u2019t feature the signature, Leica-branded dual cameras, which might be one of the main differentiators between the devices. It also probably won\u2019t come in that fun green.  Bummer.\n"}
