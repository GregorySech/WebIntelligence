{"title": "Indiegogo may now call a collection agency if backers aren\u2019t kept informed about delays", "content": " \nIndiegogo is making a pair of changes today that are designed to compel crowdfunding campaigns to be clearer with backers about the state of their products. The first change is a requirement that tech campaigns disclose what state their product is in \u2014 be it just a concept or one ready to hit the manufacturing line. And the second is a requirement that all campaigns update their backers at least once a month about how the project is going.\nIf campaigns fail to do either, Indiegogo may remove them from the platform, offer refunds, and even attempt to acquire dispersed money through collections agencies. Combined, Indiegogo hopes these measures will give people more confidence when backing a project and then again later on while waiting for it to ship, which is when delays often hit and communication tends to break down.\n\u201cOne of the things that we found is that in certain cases, either our backers didn't have all the information that they could use to help them make a decision to back a project, or after a campaign there was often not good communication between entrepreneurs and backers,\u201d Indiegogo CEO Dave Mandelbrot tells The Verge. \u201cSo we've implemented a number of changes to improve the backer experience.\u201d\nIndiegogo may refund backers or call a collections agency to recover money\nIndiegogo added the ability for campaigns to list what stage their product is in last year, but selecting a stage hasn\u2019t been a requirement. And, in a cursory look through recent tech campaigns, it seems that most don\u2019t use it. From here out, it\u2019ll be a requirement that campaign creators select a product stage before going live, choosing between concept, prototype, production, and shipping.\nCritically, Mandelbrot says that Indiegogo\u2019s moderation team will look through every campaign and validate that the creators have accurately represented how far along they are in the process. This will happen after a campaign is already live, and there won\u2019t be any way for visitors to see whether or not any given project has been verified. But if a live campaign is found to have misrepresented itself, Indiegogo will alert backers and offer them the chance to get a refund. \u201cIn more egregious cases,\u201d says Mandelbrot, \u201cwe will automatically do the refund and give backers the opportunity to back again in light of the new information.\u201d\nThe situation gets more complicated when it comes to enforcing Indiegogo\u2019s new requirement for monthly backer updates. Mandelbrot says communications issues usually start after a campaign ends, and at that point, the project\u2019s creator has taken hold of backers\u2019 money \u2014 so there\u2019s no easy way to grant refunds. Indiegogo plans to reach out to negligent campaigns as soon as 30 quiet days go by. Eventually, silent campaign creators will be given a deadline for posting some sort of update.\n\u201cAdmittedly, that one is more challenging.\u201d\nIf they don\u2019t, Indiegogo\u2019s options are limited. \u201cAdmittedly, that one is more challenging,\u201d says Mandelbrot. The company\u2019s strategy here will be to kick campaigns off the site. Indiegogo allows successful projects to continue raising money even after their campaign ends, but if they stop responding to backers before the product ships, Indiegogo can remove them so that it\u2019s harder for the company to raise more funds. That doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the situation for backers, but Mandelbrot says even removed campaigns should still have the necessary information to ship their products out to everyone who paid, if they ever get to that point.\nThat isn\u2019t the strongest action Indiegogo can take, however. In some cases, where a campaign owner \u201chas basically disappeared,\u201d Indiegogo will call a collection agency and try to recover backers\u2019 money. Mandelbrot says the company has already done this in a small number of instances and has had some success.\nIn most cases, Mandelbrot thinks it won\u2019t come to that. \u201cWhat happens more often is that an entrepreneur may tell us they're a little behind in manufacturing and are nervous about telling users,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have data. Our backers understand there will be challenges but want to be communicated with.\u201d\nUltimately, neither of these measures do much to really guarantee that backers will get their products. They\u2019re mostly just meant to keep backers more comfortable and more informed. If a product doesn\u2019t ship, there\u2019s nothing in these changes that would help backers, so long as the creator is clear about the fact that production failed. \u201cOur goal really is to ensure that the backer is making a conscious decision to back a project with an awareness of the risks involved,\u201d Mandelbrot says.\n\u201cIf we got to 100 percent [delivery], it wouldn't be crowdfunding anymore.\u201d\nIndiegogo declined to share figures on how often campaigns fail to deliver products. But a 2015 analysis of Kickstarter data found that 9 percent of that platform\u2019s crowdfunding projects failed to deliver rewards, and only 65 percent of backers said their rewards were delivered on time. \u201cProject backers should expect a failure rate of around 1-in-10 projects, and to receive a refund 13 percent of the time,\u201d wrote Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who authored the study.\nIf the numbers are at all similar on Indiegogo, it means that backing any project remains a real gamble. While Indiegogo says it\u2019s taking steps to help technology campaigns get to market \u2014 it has partnerships to connect campaign creators with IBM and Arrow Electronics to help them develop and produce their products \u2014 that still doesn\u2019t provide any sort of guarantee to backers. It just ups the odds that they might eventually get something.\nFrom Mandelbrot\u2019s perspective, that may be the best Indiegogo can offer: the company\u2019s CEO doesn\u2019t think his platform should remove all the risk from crowdfunding. \u201cIf we got to 100 percent [delivery], it wouldn't be crowdfunding anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways, those risks are always gonna exist. Otherwise people are just preordering or buying, essentially. Participating in a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo is something quite different.\u201d\n"}
