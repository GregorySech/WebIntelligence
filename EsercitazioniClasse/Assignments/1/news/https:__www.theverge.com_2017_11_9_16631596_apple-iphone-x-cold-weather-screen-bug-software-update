{"content": " \nApple today confirmed an issue causing the iPhone X\u2019s screen to become unresponsive in cold weather, saying that it\u2019s planning a software update to address the issue. Reports of the problem began popping up on the iPhone subreddit community this week, with some users saying it takes only just a few seconds for the phone to freeze up in temperatures around 0 degrees Celsius / 32 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\u201cWe are aware of instances where the iPhone X screen will become temporarily unresponsive to touch after a rapid change to a cold environment,\u201d the company told Apple blog The Loop. \u201cAfter several seconds the screen will become fully responsive again. This will be addressed in an upcoming software update.\u201d\nSome users have speculated that the changes in light from indoors to outdoors could be the culprit, due to the iPhone X\u2019s use of a front-facing infrared camera and ambient light sensor for Face ID authentication and TrueDepth photography features. Others have floated the idea that perhaps many iOS device screens could become unresponsive outside Apple\u2019s recommended temperature range of between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and that it\u2019s just more pronounced on a device without a physical home button. \nYet it\u2019s unclear exactly what the issue is. It is, however, rare for Apple to acknowledge a problem so quickly, suggesting that cold weather is definitively rendering a subset of iPhone X devices unresponsive. \n\n", "title": "Apple plans software update to fix iPhone X screen responsiveness in cold weather"}
