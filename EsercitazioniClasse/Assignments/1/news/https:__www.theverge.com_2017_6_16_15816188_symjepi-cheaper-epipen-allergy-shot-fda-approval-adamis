{"title": "Cheaper alternative to EpiPen allergy shot approved by FDA", "content": " \nThe US Food and Drug Administration has approved a new allergy shot medication that will directly compete with Mylan\u2019s EpiPen, the allergy medicine that\u2019s been heavily criticized for being unaffordable. It\u2019s not clear how much the new medication will cost, but manufacturer Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation says it\u2019ll be a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen.\nCalled Symjepi, the new allergy shot also comes in two, single-dose syringes filled with the hormone epinephrine, which ends potentially life-threatening allergy attacks from bug bites, foods like nuts, and other medication. Symjepi is expected to hit the market later this year, according to the Associated Press.\nthe exact price for the product hasn\u2019t been set yet\nEpiPen\u2019s producer, Mylan, came under fire last year for spiking the price of its drug to more than $600 from about $100 in 2007. It costs less than $20 to make a pair of EpiPens, the AP says. In December, the company launched a generic version of the drug for about $300. (A generic drug is identical to a brand-name one in terms of its chemical composition and safety, but it costs less.)\nAdamis is looking into selling the new medication, Symjepi, for less than the generic EpiPen, a company spokesman told the AP. In the meantime, the company is also preparing to apply for FDA approval of a junior version of Symjepi, which will contain less epinephrine and will compete with Mylan\u2019s EpiPen Jr.\n"}
