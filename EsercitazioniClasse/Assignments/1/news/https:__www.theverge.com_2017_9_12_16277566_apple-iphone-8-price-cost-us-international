{"title": "The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus start at $699 and $799, and are available on September 22nd", "content": " \nApple has unveiled the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus at its annual September event today, and thankfully, the less expensive iPhones of the three announced today won\u2019t totally break the bank. The iPhone 8 will start at $699, while the iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799. Both will have 64GB of storage. That\u2019s a price bump of $50 for both models, up from the 32GB models of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but it\u2019s worth noting that the 7 didn\u2019t have a 64GB option. \n\n\n    Related\n  \niPhone 8 review: the default option\n\nThe iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch Retina display, while the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina 1080p display. They will both be upgradeable to a 256GB model, which will cost $849 for the 8 and $949 for the 8 Plus. (Pricing will also vary by carrier.)\nThe new phones are made from glass and aluminum and are water resistant. They include improved stereo speakers with deeper bass, A11 bionic chip, Apple\u2019s own GPU, and 12-megapixel dual cameras. Most notably, they are now capable of wireless charging, which will work with any Qi-capable charging pad.\nThe new phones be available in three colors \u2014 silver, space gray, and gold. Apple will open preorders on September 15th in select countries, including France, China, the US, and the UK, and the phones are expected to be in stores on September 22nd. Availability broadens by September 29th to more countries, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. \nCarrier-specific prices and deals:\n\nAT&T is offering the 64GB iPhone 8 for $23.34/month for 24 months and the 64GB iPhone 8 Plus for $26.67/month for 24 months. But there\u2019s an important caveat: you don\u2019t own the phone at the end of these installment plans and will need to either trade it in for a new one or pay off the rest of the phone\u2019s retail price.\nVerizon has the 64GB iPhone 8 for $699.99 up front or for $29.17/month over 24 months; the 64GB iPhone 8 Plus goes for $799.99 up front or $33.33/month over 24 months. It also offers up to $300 off for new and existing customers who sign up for an unlimited plan and trade in select phones.\nT-Mobile is offering $300 off to any customer who trades in an iPhone 6 or newer in good condition and uses a installment plan. No word on pricing yet.\nSprint hasn\u2019t posted pricing information yet, but we\u2019ll update when they do.\n\nUpdate September 13th, 11:20 am: Added carrier-specific pricing information.\n\n"}
