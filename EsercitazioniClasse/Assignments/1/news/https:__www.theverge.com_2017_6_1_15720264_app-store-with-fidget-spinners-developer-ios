{"title": "Meet the trend-chasing developers filling the App Store with fidget spinners", "content": " \nIt\u2019s summer 2017 and the App Store is spilling over with fidget spinner apps. Their titles are largely uninspired, impossible to tell apart: Fidget Spinner, Fidget Spinner Toy, Fidget Hand Spinner, Fidget Spin. Most are lazy re-creations of the popular stress reliever. All are indicative of a larger trend in mobile gaming to identify and mass-produce the hot idea of the moment.  \nThe fidget spinner \u2014 a cheap, easy-to-make object that you can pick up at your local bodega or gas station \u2014 exploded into popularity in late April. The toy, which comes in a variety of colors and shapes, has inspired techno music, phone cases, rocket-powered safety nightmares, and even the dry world of workplace art. \nFidget apps began to overflow in the App Store around mid-May. The rush to crank out clones and copies is a predictable aspect of the mobile ecosystem. Flappy Bird, Threes!, Pok\u00e9mon Go: all of these games were followed by a surge of rushed rip-offs hoping to ride the wave of popularity and skim some cash in the process.\nBut fidget spinners are a strange take on this trend: a play off the popularity of a physical toy that serves very little purpose, translated into a digital app that does even less. The entire point of a fidget spinner is the tactile feel that no app can capture.\nEarlier this month, Ketchapp\u2019s Fidget Spinner was the top free app in the App Store; it\u2019s since fallen to number six. The app isn\u2019t a high-quality game or a good stress-releasing spinner toy. As my colleague Paul Miller explained, \u201cThe whole app is basically designed to minimize your time fidget spinning while maximizing ad impressions.\u201d \nTrend chasing developers approach the market like gamblers\nDeveloper Ketchapp has a history of controversial apps. The company has been accused of cloning games like Sirvo\u2019s Threes! and ustwo Games\u2019 Monument Valley with 2048 and Skyward. Ketchapp disputes these claims. Last February, co-founder and co-director Antoine Morcos told Tech Insider that Skyward was a different type of game that didn\u2019t fall into the same genre Monument Valley. His response to 2048\u2019s similarities to Threes! Was that \"all [car] racing games look the same.\u201d\nToday, Ketchapp exists under the umbrella of publisher Ubisoft. The company behind AAA franchises like Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, and Watch Dogs acquired Ketchapp last year. \nFidget Spinner looks and functions like many other fidget spinner games in the App Store, but it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s mimicking who. It seems all parties are equally looking to cash in on a hot, albeit undoubtedly short-lived, trend. In an email to The Verge, Morcos says the idea was inspired by the popularity of real-life spinners. \u201cSeeing [people] playing the Fidget Spinner everywhere has given us the idea to create a game based on this trend, that would be as addictive as the real toy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came up with something interesting and unique, the idea of spinning the fidget to earn coins, which in return would let you unlock new crazy models. Also, there is a concept of \u2018the more you are good in spinning, the better you will improve the stats of your spinner over time.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrend-chasing developers approach the market like gamblers: the more you play, the better your odds. A handful of creators have multiple fidget spinner games listed on their developer page, or attached to different accounts. Binh Nguyen\u2019s iPhone apps, for example, include four fidget spinner-themed games: Tappy Fidget Spinner 3D & Challenge Games, Fidget Spinner!, Spinner Color Finger - Fidget Ping Pong Games, and Swing Fidget Spinner - Arcade Games. \nAll four games are listed under Binh Nguyen, but clicking the websites associated with each will take you on a wild goose chase. Tappy Fidget Spinner directs to an unfinished website, labeled \u201cGames iOS 2017,\u201d with images of men and women on a beach. Fidget Spinner! is a Facebook fan page for Five Keys Studio; Spinner Color Finger leads to a Facebook page for Five Keys Studio IOS Games, as does Swing Fidget Spinner. Both Facebook pages share the Five Keys logo with the Arts Game page, a website associated with Le Anh, which has its own Fidget Spinner game on the App Store, Flappy Fidget Spinner - Returns Classic Games \u2014 a clear knockoff of Flappy Bird, but with the popular toy. \nNeptun Digital is another developer taking more than one bite from the same apple. It lists two games, Fidget Spinner - Finger Hand Spin Simulator and Fidget Spinner - Hand Spin Simulator; if you\u2019re having trouble telling them apart, the former uses a red-and-gray color palette while the latter is primarily blue and gray. Neptun Digital is a team of five based in Slovenia. Their only other game on the App Store is called Jumping Fred!, a game starring a red-feathered fellow with an Angry Birds aesthetic. Aljosa Pavsic, the company\u2019s CEO, said that creating these apps took less than a week to develop from scratch.\nWhen asked what sets a game like Fidget Spinner - Finger Hand Spin Simulator apart from others in the App Store, Pavsic says, \u201cOur game in comparison to others has multiple fidget spinners to play with simultaneously.\u201d (In testing out a wide variety of fidget spinner games, The Verge found that several did offer a variety of spinners to choose from.) \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinny Fidget\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d Pavsic says, \u201call the fidget spinners on the App Store are a response to this new fidget spin phenomenon, because the digital world (social media, YouTube, app stores) is almost always a response to the real-life events happening around us. People these days tend to search for a digital experience after each physical one if possible.\u201d\nTastypill claims to have produced the first spinner game \u2014 Spinny Fidget  \u2014 in the App Store\u2019s top charts. (It\u2019s also the creator of Fidget Spin.) \u201cIt was not a craze yet until we realized we were gaining chart momentum,\u201d founder Phillip Kung tells The Verge. \u201cNow there are many of these games, several of which have cracked the top charts. Many more are being introduced into the app store each day \u2026 We created Spinny Fidget with a completely unique and never before done game play mechanic. Just 1\u20132 weeks after we released our game and hit the top 5 in the app store there are more than a dozen games that have released that are exact clones of our game.\u201d\nKung says Tastypill released two games themed around fidget spinners in an effort to best penetrate the market. There is no fear of diluting or dividing players. Fidget spinner loyalty is apparently hard to come by. \u201cWe know that the traffic is going to be there,\u201d he says, \u201cand that a large portion of the audience will download several different games based on the trend.\u201d \nSpinny Fidget took about a week to complete, the developer says. The short development time on these games is indicative of their life span. Regardless of how many developers crank out games, the fidget spinner craze will die, as all these fads do. According to Google trends, search interest has already begun to wane. Developers are looking for whatever the next big thing may be. \nKetchapp is the most prolific of the developers The Verge interviewed, having released dozens of games under its banner on the App Store. When asked by how the studio prepares for the next big thing, Morcos gives a vague answers:\n\u201cAt Ketchapp, we want to stay connected with our audience, in real time if we can,\u201d Morcos says, \u201cand really understand what our fans love to do these days. This changes very rapidly. The idea is to create games based on what they love to do, or what they currently are interested in. It could be anything.\u201d \n\u201cIf I could personally go back to school and spend time with teens,\u201d he continues, \u201cit would definitely help me better understand the trends and new behaviors on mobile phones.\u201d\nIn other words, the flood of trend-chasing games is dictated by the fickle infatuations of the average 13-year-old. The truth is almost enough to make your head spin.\n\n\n"}
