{"title": "Doctor Who\u2019s 10th season gets a new trailer", "content": " \nThe 10th season of the rebooted Doctor Who is almost here, and the BBC is stepping up the marketing with a new trailer ahead of the April 15th premiere. While we\u2019ve already seen bits and pieces from the upcoming season, the new trailer gives us our best look yet at The Doctor\u2019s latest adventures, as well as the return of some familiar foes in the form of the Daleks and the Cyberman. \nFans have been waiting a long time for a proper new season of Doctor Who, following the ninth season in Fall 2015. The 10th season also marks a time of transition for the long-running science fiction franchise, being the last season for both Peter Capaldi (the 12th Doctor) and long-time showrunner Steven Moffat. But while the new season may be Capaldi\u2019s last, it will be the first for a new companion, Bill Potts (played by Pearl Mackie), although the BBC hasn\u2019t said whether Mackie will be staying on after Capaldi leaves. Also returning is Matt Lucas as Nardole, an alien that had previously appeared earlier in Capaldi\u2019s run and who\u2019ll be traveling in the TARDIS alongside the Doctor and Bill this season.\nDoctor Who season 10 will premiere on April 15th. \n"}
