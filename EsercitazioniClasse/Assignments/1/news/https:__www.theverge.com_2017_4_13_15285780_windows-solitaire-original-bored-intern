{"title": "A bored intern created the original Windows Solitaire", "content": " \nSolitaire has been a staple for office distraction since Microsoft first included the game in Windows 3.0 in 1990. But the digital adaptation wasn\u2019t made by an iconic coder or just one of the company\u2019s many full-time employees. It was programmed by an intern. \nGreat Big Story has an interview with Wes Cherry, who was an intern at Microsoft in 1988. He describes the experience as \u201call-encompassing,\u201d but even internships at Microsoft have lulls. He put the downtime to good use. \u201cI came up with the idea to write Solitaire for Windows out of boredom, really,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many games at the time, so we had to make them.\u201d \nIn the digital version of this classic card game, players use a mouse to drag and drop cards by suit. If you successfully complete a game, your prize is a cascade of cards. \nCherry\u2019s game got an official blessing from Bill Gates himself (though Gates\u2019 \u201cbiggest complaint was that Solitaire was too hard to win\u201d), and it became a staple of Microsoft\u2019s operating system. \u201cMicrosoft officially said that Solitaire was there to teach people how to use the mouse, but in reality it was just something to have fun with,\u201d he said. Cherry even had added a special \u201cboss key\u201d that would pop up a fake spreadsheet for crafty office workers slacking, but Microsoft nixed it. \nThe real kicker of this story is that, despite its long-standing success, Cherry said he \u201cwas not paid a single cent.\u201d He\u2019s since moved on from computer work to owning a cidery. \n\n\n\n"}
