{"title": "How to watch Formula E\u2019s championship fight in Montreal this weekend", "content": " \nThe final weekend of the third season of all-electric racing series Formula E is here, and it features a pair of races in Montreal that will decide the winners of two trophies. Renault has almost completely run away with the team championship, so that one\u2019s pretty much settled. But 10 points is all that separates Sebastien Buemi from his challenger in the drivers\u2019 championship fight, Lucas di Grassi. Both races \u2014 one on Saturday and one on Sunday \u2014 start at 4PM ET.\nIt\u2019s a similar, if not quite the same, situation as the finale to season two. Last July, di Grassi came into the final weekend actually leading Buemi by one point. But at the start of the second race of that weekend\u2019s double-header, he crashed into Buemi, and di Grassi wound up losing the championship. \nThis year the drivers will fight for the trophy on a 2.75-kilometer (1.71-mile), 14-turn track along the St. Lawrence river. Formula E has never been to Montreal before, just like it had never been to New York City until two weeks ago, but by all accounts the track looks fast and fun, and should serve as a great venue for the two races.\nThis is an exciting year for Formula E, and a great time to start watching the young series, because big names like Jaguar and BMW have joined an already competitive field. The greater push toward electric vehicles has caused major automakers to either flock to the series or express their interest. (Mercedes has secured an option to enter in season 5, and Ferrari even said it\u2019s considering joining.)  \nFormula E has only run 28 races so far, so you might be wondering just what the hell it is. You\u2019re not alone! The series pulled in hundreds of thousands of viewers per race in both the US and the UK last season, but the awareness is still low \u2014 especially outside of the motorsports world.\nYou\u2019re not alone if you don\u2019t know about Formula E, but you should give it a shot \u2014 even if you don\u2019t like racing\nThat said, there\u2019s a lot to like about Formula E that might even appeal to people who have never sat through a full NASCAR, IndyCar, or Formula One race. (For one, Formula E races are short!) So here\u2019s a quick breakdown of how you can watch this weekend\u2019s races, and a guide on the most important things to keep an eye on if you\u2019re new to the series. \n\nHow to watch\nTV\nFox owns the broadcast rights in the United States, and many of the races air live on either Fox Sports 1 or Fox Sports 2. That means they\u2019re also available on the Fox Sports Go mobile app (if you have a cable subscription). Both of this weekend\u2019s races in Montreal will air live on Fox Sports 2 at 4PM ET. In Canada, the races will air live on RDS and on CTV. \nChannel 5 owns the UK broadcast rights this season. Saturday\u2019s race can be seen at 8:30PM BST,  but Sunday\u2019s will air live at 8:30PM BST on Spike. Formula E broadcasts in dozens of other countries, too, and those schedules can be found here. \nOnline\nOutside of certain countries (like the US), Formula E streams its races on its website and mobile app for free. If you miss a race, the series usually has a 5\u20136-minute highlight video posted to YouTube within the first 24 hours. Later in the week the series uploads a 50-minute version \u2014 essentially the full race for free. One other great place for info is the Formula E subreddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to watch for\nFormula E is a racing series. The cars may be electric, and there are definitely some other quirks (which we\u2019ll get to), but if you\u2019ve seen an F1 or IndyCar race, it\u2019s fairly similar. There are 10 teams with two drivers per team for a total of 20 cars, competing across a 12 race season. There are two championship trophies: one for the driver with the most points at the end of the season, and one for the highest-scoring team. \nBut there are important differences in Formula E that set it apart.\n\nLocations, locations, locations\nOne of the most unique aspects of Formula E is that almost every race takes place on a temporary street circuit in or near the center of a major city. The series leverages the fact that the cars are relatively quiet compared to their oil-burning counterparts, as well as local governments\u2019 willingness to promote anything related to clean energy, in order to pull this all off. It\u2019s a refreshing break from the purpose-built racing circuits that flood the Formula One race calendar.\nNo other series races in city centers like this\nThe series has already pulled off races in cities like Paris, Berlin, London, Miami, and Long Beach. In season 3, Formula E added New York City, Montreal, Hong Kong, Marrakesh, and Brussels to the mix. The series is also heading to Rome next season.\nThere are a few reasons for racing in cities. First and foremost, it\u2019s a promotional tool. If you can pull off a race in the middle of a city, you\u2019re bound to attract more attention from outside the motorsport world than you would at a track that\u2019s miles away. Second, it keeps the courses shorter, since the series has to minimize the impact on the host city. Shorter courses mean closer racing, but more braking and turns means the batteries can last a bit longer, too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drivers have to race these electric cars differently\nFormula E is like other racing series at a very high level, but the actual racing is distinct, because the drivers aren\u2019t always pushing the cars as hard as they possibly can. Formula E drivers have to strike a very tough balance between running hard to race for the win and managing the remaining energy in the battery. The cars have both regular brakes and regenerative brakes, the latter of which can send kinetic energy back into the battery. But recharging the battery this way heats it up, so they also have to be sure not to overheat the system \u2014 otherwise, the car will shut down. \nYou can watch Formula E races without really paying attention to this aspect of the competition, but it\u2019s a significant source of drama. The broadcast does a good job keeping you informed about what drivers are struggling to strike this balance, thanks to a great pair of announcers, the occasional eavesdropping on team radio communications, and the fact that you can always see how much battery each driver has left.\n\nWhere\u2019s Tesla? \nThere are some huge automotive names involved with Formula E already. Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Audi, and Citro\u00ebn all run (or have a hand in running) teams. Lesser-known startups are in the mix, too \u2014 Faraday Future and NextEV, two electric car companies with Chinese backing, race in the series. Formula E also has some big-name team sponsors, like Virgin and Panasonic. And there are some legacy motorsport names involved, too: legendary F1 driver Alain Prost runs the Renault team (and his son drives one of the cars), Mario Andretti\u2019s son Michael runs another team, and Jay Penske \u2014 son of NASCAR and IndyCar team owner Roger Penske \u2014 runs a team as well.\nBut this is electric racing, so where\u2019s Tesla?  \nElon, you up? \nThe thinking is that all these other companies are just starting to explore electric vehicles, so they are interested in Formula E because it can help lay some technical and philosophical foundation when it comes to developing an EV. Tesla has been making electric cars for a while now, so it\u2019s likely that the company just doesn\u2019t see the need to get involved. Joining Formula E would also require time, money, and labor \u2014 things that a company with thin margins like Tesla probably can\u2019t afford. (Tesla fans looking for a racing fix should keep an eye on the Electric GT World Series, launching in 2017.)\n\nThe announcers are great \nSpeaking of, those announcers are superb. Jack Nicholls and Dario Franchitti have become an incredible announcing team over the course of the first two seasons. Nicholls is excitable and high-energy, while Franchitti \u2014 a four-time IndyCar champion and three-time Indy 500 winner \u2014 is cool, insightful, and funny. The races are worth watching to listen to their commentary alone.\n\n\n\nThe races are short, and that\u2019s a good thing\nFormula E races are shorter than almost every other major motorsport. NASCAR\u2019s marathon races can last upwards of four hours, F1 and IndyCar hover in the 1\u20132-hour range. Formula E races last about 50 minutes. This is a good thing \u2014 during a long NASCAR race, it\u2019s sometimes easy to lose the thread of what\u2019s going on. The ticking clock of Formula E means the drama is always palpable. \nThe short race length is also out of the series\u2019s hands right now, since the batteries in the cars are only currently capable of lasting around 25 minutes under the stress of the race. This will change in season 5 when the series gets a newer, more powerful battery. But until then, it means every driver has to make one pit stop in the middle of the race. They don\u2019t swap batteries though, they swap cars.\n\nThe drivers swap cars mid-race, but it\u2019s fine\nI\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s weird watching a driver \u2014 especially one who\u2019s spent 25 minutes fighting tooth and nail for the lead of the race \u2014 pull into the pits, hop out of a car, hop into another one, and take off again. Formula E chose this route because quickly swapping a battery in the middle of the race could be extremely dangerous for the pit crew (and making the battery easily removable would add weight to the cars, making them slower). \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: it\u2019s fine! The car swaps take about a minute but they are otherwise no different from a pit stop. And since the drivers only have to make one stop \u2014 not two or three or four like in other series \u2014 the car swaps add some clear drama to each race. Some drivers try to conserve energy in the first half of the race in order squeeze an extra lap out of the battery, allowing them to push the second car harder. Other drivers push their cars too hard and risk killing the battery before crossing the finish line. The race broadcasts constantly show each drivers\u2019 remaining battery percentage, too, so there\u2019s no guesswork. \nRegardless, this will all change in season 5, when the series will have a new battery from McLaren that will last the entire race.\n\nFanboost\nOne of the most talked-about aspects of Formula E when it was created was \u201cFanboost,\u201d a fan voting contest held before each race that awards the winning drivers an extra boost of power that they can use in the race. Many people, especially longtime race fans, hated this idea. But over two seasons it\u2019s amounted to almost nothing. The drivers mention it on broadcasts and tweet about it all the time, but that\u2019s because they have to \u2014 it\u2019s an obvious tool for engaging with the fans. In the context of the race, the extra bit of power often means nothing. \nWhile the voting aspect is unique, the idea of a power boost isn\u2019t \u2014 other racing series  have similar ideas, just in different forms. IndyCar drivers have access to a \u201cpush to pass\u201d button that affords a number of boosts throughout a race, and Formula One has a few different systems that let drivers temporarily make their cars go faster. \n\nThe drivers are talented, but you probably don\u2019t know who they are\nThe drivers of Formula E are a pretty exceptional bunch even if they\u2019re not household names. (To be fair, recognition is a problem for most motorsports these days.) A cynic could look at them as cast-offs from other series like Formula One, but the reality is that F1 is a really hard series to compete in \u2014 if you even come near running an F1 car, you\u2019re probably one of the most talented drivers in the world. \nName recognition is not Formula E\u2019s strong suit\nSome of the drivers already have outsized personalities that match their talent. Lucas di Grassi is a happy-go-lucky championship contender. Sebastien Buemi is a temperamental trophy-winner. Nelson Piquet Jr. is probably the most recognizable of the bunch to anyone who\u2019s casually followed motorsports in the last decade. \nThe drivers who\u2019ve been in the series for a while now never shut up about how competitive the field is. But if Formula E wants to grow beyond being a niche sport, it\u2019s either going to have to bring world-renowned drivers into the mix or find a way to make its current stars more recognizable.\n\nRoborace\nOr it could ditch drivers altogether. At some point in the near future, Formula E could have a warm-up act called Roborace. It will supposedly pit some Tron-style self-driving cars against each other on the same city circuits that Formula E runs on. But Roborace\u2019s organizers haven\u2019t picked an actual debut date yet. So far we\u2019ve only seen footage of its test car, known as \u201cDevBot,\u201d and some footage of the production car slowly lapping the Paris track. The people behind it have been publishing behind-the-scenes documentary shorts, which helps shed some more light on the project. It\u2019s a fascinating idea, for sure, but Formula E is already a really hard sell in a crowded media landscape. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you find it interesting or not, Formula E is doing something completely outrageous. The series gathered up hundreds of millions of dollars of investment money and pumped it all into this electric racing series. When you look at where things are headed with electric vehicles, it makes sense that there will be all sorts of electric racing in 5, 10, or 20 years \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s already happening. \n\n\n\n\n"}
