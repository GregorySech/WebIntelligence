{"title": "Verizon built Inspector Gadget\u2019s car to promote a dongle", "content": " \nIf the phrase \u201cgo go gadget car\u201d conjures up warm memories, then you\u2019ll probably get a kick out of Verizon\u2019s latest PR stunt: the Hum Rider. With the flip of a switch, this modified SUV can shoot skyward on hydraulic lifts, allowing it to literally drive over other cars. It\u2019s every frustrated-driver-stuck-in-a-gridlock\u2019s dream come true. \nHere are the specs, according to Verizon:\n\nHum Rider widens to about eight feet and elevates five feet, so it can drive over a wide range of vehicles.\nHum Rider features over 300 feet of hydraulic lines that power everything from the steering and braking to the locomotion.\nA single gas-powered Honda generator sits under the hood, delivering electricity to the pumps that drive 900 pounds of pressure to power all the hydraulic pumps. \nHum Rider weighs 8,500 pounds, almost double the weight of a standard Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nVerizon says the Hum Rider drives like a normal car \u201cin about every other way.\u201d That said, we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t point out that Verizon built this car simply to promote the Hum, an after-market connected car gadget. The Hum enables geofencing and speed alert features, and is basically being marketed as a way for worried parents to keep tabs on their newly licensed teens. \nHum, which costs $10 per month, includes a module that plugs into a car's onboard diagnostics port, and a hands-free unit that can clip to a visor. Between the two \u2014 plus a smartphone app \u2014 the service offers vehicle health monitoring, roadside and emergency assistance, and stolen vehicle tracking. In addition to the location and speed alerts, the device will enable location tracking (a small expansion of stolen vehicle tracking) and a driving log, which measures travel times, engine idle times, and average speeds.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t find video of the car going into stilt-mode, so this will have to suffice.\n\n\n\nHow that relates to an SUV that can drive around on stilts is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cOf course your car can\u2019t do that,\u201d Verizon chuckles in the promotional video for the Hum Rider. \u201cBut Hum can upgrade your ride with other new tricks.\u201d Get it? Upgrade? Up? Grade? Yeah, me neither.\nI\u2019m not saying that Verizon set out to replicate Inspector Gadget\u2019s beloved Gadgetmobile, but damn if they didn\u2019t come close. The only other attempt I\u2019ve seen to build a vehicle that can literally drive over other vehicles is the dearly departed Chinese elevated bus / train hybrid that set the internet ablaze briefly in 2016, only to later be exposed as a total hoax. RIP, straddling bus. I never stopped believing in you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Xinhua News\n\n\n\n"}
