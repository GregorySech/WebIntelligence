{"title": "Facebook gives super-fans a home with new groups feature", "content": " \nFacebook is rolling out a new feature called \u201cGroups for Pages,\u201d which allows people who run Facebook Pages to create sub-groups within them. These groups will let dedicated users chat to one another, and to the owners of the page directly. They\u2019ll  provide a space for discussion of niche or specialized topics, with Chris Cox, chief product office at Facebook, comparing them to fan clubs. \n\u201cIf you are an artist, a business, a brand, or a newspaper, you can now create fan clubs and groups centered around your super-fans,\u201d said Cox in a Facebook post.\nReal-time discussions\nCox says the feature came about when The Washington Post\u2019s digital and comment editors, Terri Rupar and Teddy Amenabar, started a group called PostThis \u2013 from The Washington Post. The group allowed reporters to speak directly to passionate readers of the paper and explain how stories came together. Cox compares this to a \u201cdigital version of letters to the editor, but with ongoing real-time discussions.\u201d \nThe new feature also means that brands can create their own groups without having to use employees\u2019 personal accounts, which helps protect their privacy. \nIn a separate post, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he hoped the new feature will help more people join meaningful communities. He highlighted one page, AddictionUnscripted.com, which has a separate support group for people affected by addiction. It already has a membership of 45,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AddictionUnscripted.com Facebook page\nPhoto: Facebook\n\n\n\u201cIn today's world, we all get support from a few sources: our family and friends, our communities, and our social safety net,\u201d wrote Zuckerberg. \u201cIn our civic discussion we most often focus on our social safety net, but I've found that our communities are often just as important for taking care of us, and we need to focus just as much time on building them.\u201d\nFacebook says there are currently 70 million pages that represent artists, businesses, brands, and newspapers across the social networking site. That\u2019s a lot of potential groups \u2014 and a lot of discussion to be had. \n"}
