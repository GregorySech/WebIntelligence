{"title": "Colossal is a sharp, weird monster movie that seems destined to infuriate its fan base", "content": " \nIf there were a gambling site where you could go to make bets on how people are bound to react to individual movies, the money-making gambit of the season would be slapping your life savings on \u201cColossal is really going to piss people off.\u201d How many people, and how pissed off they\u2019re going to get, will probably depend on whether the advertising gets more specific and transparent about what the movie actually is. From the currently available teaser, Nacho Vigalondo\u2019s latest movie (after 2014\u2019s insane Elijah Wood / Sasha Grey stalker movie Open Windows and various horror shorts for the V/H/S and ABCs Of Death series) looks like a playful magical-realist comedy about a woman discovering she\u2019s somehow controlling a giant monster on the other side of the planet. It\u2019s sort of that, for a few minutes at a time. The rest of the time, it\u2019s a strong, angry statement about gender relationships that seems primed to alienate roughly half its audience.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSundance Film Festival 2017\nRead the latest reviews, interviews, and news from the annual film fest at Park City.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nPainful relationship drama, except with kaiju. \nWhat\u2019s it about?\nGloria (Anne Hathaway) is an unhappy, unemployed, self-absorbed alcoholic New Yorker who\u2019s just been understandably dumped by her exasperated boyfriend Tim (The Guest\u2019s Dan Stevens). Lacking other options, she heads back to her small hometown to live in her parents\u2019 old, empty house. Soon she runs into childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) and his buddies Joel (Austin Stowell) and Garth (Tim Blake Nelson), gets a job at Oscar\u2019s bar, and settles in to what seems like a cheerful life of blackout drinking and low-stakes hanging out. Then a giant lizard-like monster starts terrorizing Seoul, and Gloria accidentally discovers the monster is mirroring her movements. (The monster prompted a lawsuit from Godzilla rights-holder Toho Co. after Vigalondo ill-advisedly described the movie as \u201cthe cheapest Godzilla movie ever.\u201d The lawsuit was settled in 2015.) Having complete control of a giant monster sounds like a fantasy come true, especially for a woman who\u2019s so clearly out of control in so many other ways. But the burden becomes a tremendous emotional burden for Gloria, who isn\u2019t even equipped to handle the minimal responsibility of blowing up her own air mattress. And things get much worse when one of the men in her life starts using the monster situation to blackmail her, trying to force her into an unwanted, squirmy intimacy.\n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nAbusive relationships, all the sleazy manipulative tactics abusers use, and also kaiju. \nBut is it any good? \nTo quote The Simpsons, \u201cShort answer, yes with an if; long answer, no with a but.\u201d Vigalondo pitched the movie as \u201cGodzilla meets Being John Malkovich,\u201d a description that\u2019s both exciting to a \u201cshut up and take my money\u201d degree, and not entirely accurate. The Being John Malkovich parallels are there, given the film\u2019s heady high-concept weirdness and its inexplicable magical plot hook. But Colossal has much more in common with the Jason Reitman / Diablo Cody movie Young Adult, another movie about a caustically selfish alcoholic licking her wounds in her small hometown, and running into an old acquaintance who\u2019s unhealthily obsessed with her. That movie was divisive \u2014 it\u2019s bold and funny in the ugliest of ways, and the protagonist (played by Charlize Theron) is beautifully acted, but it\u2019s also about a repulsive character who never repents, and ultimately doubles down on her self-absorption. Colossal\u2019s heroine is only slightly softer. Like Reitman, Vigalondo has no interest in the trite \u201cstruggling city person finds healing in the slow pace of a small town\u201d tropes, and no interest in softening his lead character into rote likability when he could make her distinctive instead. \nGloria is intriguing because she\u2019s so damaged and has so many hurdles in her way. (And also: kaiju!) But she often isn\u2019t particularly sympathetic, and neither is anyone around her. Colossal is unmissably harsh on its male characters, all of whom are sheepish and ineffectual at absolute best, and downright malevolent at worst. There are no upsides to relationships in this movie, or really to men in general.\nAnd there\u2019s a really uncomfortable and unexamined side to the kaiju phenomenon, which has some vague and hand-waved number of anonymous Koreans dying every night as the price of Gloria\u2019s failure to get her act together. Given the opportunity to lampshade rubber-suit movies, or explore why people are so jazzed to see monsters flattening cities, Vigalondo waves it all off in order to focus more deeply on nice-guy syndrome and Gloria\u2019s weak excuses for her behavior. The relationship drama is keenly drawn, but it also often feels like a grotesque focus on the pouty behavior of a couple of spoiled, overgrown white kids, at the expense of an entire foreign city. And even in a movie with giant monsters and random magic, a few key of the plot moments \u2014 particularly one involving a giant firework \u2014 make no narrative sense.\nIn spite of all that, Colossal is riveting. Huge credit is due to the actors: Hathaway\u2019s naked emotion about the destruction she\u2019s caused in Korea is the only counterbalance for the movie\u2019s seeming indifference otherwise, and by the end, she makes her kinda-repulsive character sympathetic and even cathartic. Sudeikis\u2019 \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you, why don\u2019t you love me\u201d performance is also absolutely stellar, and it becomes the movie\u2019s mesmerizing center. Joel\u2019s appealing dopiness, Nelson\u2019s vibrating energy, and Stevens\u2019 usual intensity all count for a lot as well. People don\u2019t normally go to Japanese-style monster movies for great acting, but this film relies so much on character dynamics that it\u2019s a tremendous relief when the cast rises to the occasion.\nAnd the movie\u2019s aesthetics are terrific, particularly the emotionally intense score from ever-reliable Battlestar Galactica composer Bear McCreary and the glowing sunlit cinematography by Eric Kress. The homey interior of Oscar\u2019s sports bar, Gloria\u2019s late-night and early-morning sojourns around town, the bleached-out flashbacks exploring how the kaiju happened \u2014 they\u2019re all beautifully shot. But beyond the film\u2019s strong look and feel, it\u2019s memorable because the script is so bizarre and unexpected, so confident and daring about what it\u2019s trying to do. In subtle ways, it\u2019s also witty and knowing. Vigalondo builds a whole subplot out of the ways people react to giant monsters in their midst, with Internet memes and viral videos and livestreaming cameras, and inevitably by choosing to identify in specific, instantly recognizable ways with something they don\u2019t understand. No matter how unrealistic pieces of the movie get, ideas like the online reaction to Gloria\u2019s monster feel not just real, but sly and smart and tapped in to the zeitgeist. Colossal can be off-putting, and unapologetic about it. But it\u2019s all-in on its strange central monster conceit, on its cruel character dynamics, and on its rough, dark sense of humor. It\u2019s the kind of film that\u2019s guaranteed to make people angry, but it\u2019s still unmissable.\nWhat should it be rated? \nThe Korean death and destruction is pretty bloodless, but the emotional violence gets rough. Call it a PG-13. \nHow can I actually watch it?\nColossal opens in New York and Los Angeles on April 7th and expands nationwide on April 14th.
