{"title": "Apple might ditch Touch ID altogether for next year\u2019s iPhones", "content": " \nIt\u2019s a little early to put much credibility in rumors about the next iPhones coming in 2018. But KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has established a strong track record of Apple hardware forecasts, says that the company is likely to completely move away from Touch ID on the successors to this year\u2019s iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X. MacRumors reported on Kuo\u2019s latest note. Hopefully the various components of the tech will be more readily available by then; the Face ID system is believed to be one of the bottlenecks that could severely limit supply of the iPhone X when it goes on sale November 3rd. \nThe iPhone X is the first Apple smartphone to feature a design with no home button, and it replaces Touch ID with the company\u2019s new Face ID technology. Kuo\u2019s prediction is  that we\u2019ve seen the last of Touch ID with the iPhone 8, and next year will see Apple go all in on Face ID. \"We believe this change will allow all new models to realize a competitive advantage via differentiation, on the back of an integrated user experience of full-screen design and TrueDepth Camera/Facial recognition/Face ID/AR applications,\" Kuo wrote in his note. \nKuo previously hedged that Face ID completely replacing Touch ID so quickly would depend on the public\u2019s reception to the new feature on the iPhone X, but he seems to be more confident that it\u2019s the plan now. Earlier this week, Kuo said in another note that he also expects to see the iPad Pro gain the new facial recognition system sometime next year when the line is updated. \n"}
