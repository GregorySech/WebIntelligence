{"title": "You can watch Ferris Bueller on the Domino\u2019s Facebook page this weekend if you want", "content": " \nTo celebrate the 31st anniversary of Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off (a very important anniversary, needless to say), Domino\u2019s will be streaming the movie for free on its Facebook page on Sunday, June 11th at 7PM ET. \nVariety reports that the showing will be part of a series of \u201cFacebook Live Movie Nights\u201d on the pizza chain\u2019s page, and also explains how pizza will play into the event: there will be pizza discount codes available to viewers. According to Domino\u2019s, the \u201cmore people who watch, the higher the discount could be.\u201d Okay, so even if you have Ferris on DVD and no interest in pizza you can tune in to help someone else get a better pizza discount, if you\u2019re in a low-effort altruism mood on Sunday evening. \nwho doesn\u2019t want to spend two hours of a sunday evening on facebook?\nDomino\u2019s is pretty well known for its tech hobby, so it was probably only a matter of time until it made its way to Facebook Live. Whoever is the ideas guy or gal over there really loves churning out innovative new pizza-tech pairings, such as ordering a pizza with an emoji, ordering a pizza with an Amazon Echo, ordering a pizza with your car, ordering a pizza with your Samsung Smart TV, ordering a pizza with an app just by opening it and clicking nothing. (Most of the ideas involve pizza ordering.) \nIn some countries, Domino\u2019s also has robots. Unfortunately Papa John\u2019s did beat Domino\u2019s to the idea of ordering a pizza with an Apple TV app. And Pizza Hut beat it to the idea of ordering a pizza with a Facebook Messenger chatbot. The pizza tech wars are ongoing, and though Domino\u2019s is still firmly in the lead, it clearly has a target on its back. \nHence: Ferris, a guy with a target on his back, who comes up unscathed over and over. \n"}
