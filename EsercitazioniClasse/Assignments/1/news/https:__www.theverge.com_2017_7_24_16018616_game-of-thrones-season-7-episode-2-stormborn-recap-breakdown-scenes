{"title": "Game of Thrones, Stormborn: a breakdown of the 5 most memorable scenes", "content": " \nThe second episode of Game of Thrones season 7 was a long series of reminders of where and how the show began. It feels like half of \u201cStormborn\u201d is an extended callback to season 1. There\u2019s Daenerys and Varys, reminding us of her brother Viserys and the plot to sell the young woman to Khal Drogo. Varys offers his own history lesson about Robert Baratheon, whose death kicked off the entire game of thrones. There\u2019s Tyrion Lannister sidechanning Jon Snow with a quote from an important conversation they had in the show\u2019s first episode. And then we have Arya, finally turning toward the home she left \u2014 and reuniting with the dire wolf she sent away in the series\u2019s second episode.\nThey aren\u2019t the only characters reflecting on the past. Sam and Archmaester Marwyn also talk their way through Robert\u2019s Rebellion, and Cersei and Qyburn get into it as they consider how to fight dragons. Sam also sets out to save Jorah out of respect for his father Jeor, who took Sam in at the Wall and replaced the aspiring maester\u2019s own, much less accepting father. \nIt\u2019s as if the overused George Santayana quote \u2014 \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d \u2014 somehow made its way from our world to Westeros, becoming a universal mantra along the way. Practically everybody is considering how the past can inform their future. Loyalty and trust are rare commodities on Game of Thrones, and in \u201cStormborn,\u201d everyone\u2019s considering who they really trust, and what they\u2019ve done to deserve it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Helen Sloan / HBO\n\n\nArya Stark and the Hot Pie reunion\nTasha: There were certainly bigger, bloodier, and more important things going on in \u201cStormborn\u201d than a quiet conversation between Arya Stark and the baker kid she left behind at an inn in season 3. But nothing in this episode sparked as much emotion for me as the look on Arya\u2019s face when Hot Pie tells her the Boltons are dead and Jon Snow is ruling Winterfell. It\u2019s a terrific, understated moment from Maisie Williams \u2014 just look at her eyes, how she processes hope with just a little terror, because it\u2019s let her down so much in the past.\nThe Red Wedding didn\u2019t just kill Arya\u2019s mother and brother. It killed her hopes of a family reunion, and with it any sense of safety or connection for her somewhere in Westeros. (It explains a great deal of her reckless, brutal, and often extremely adult behavior since.) But meeting Hot Pie again was a reminder that not every friend of Arya is dead yet.\n\u201cI\u2019m like you, Arry. I\u2019m a survivor,\u201d he tells her, as she prepares to hit the road without even finishing her food. He doesn\u2019t know how wrong he is. He\u2019s not like her \u2014 he\u2019s a baker, she\u2019s a face-changing mass murderer. (Though they do both bake pies, even if she doesn\u2019t bother to brown the butter while she\u2019s murdering Freys and cooking them up for their unwitting father to eat. Bonus points to this scene for that callback in-joke.) But still, this was a sweet and moving scene. Arya\u2019s essentially cared about nothing but various forms of murder and revenge since season 1, yet here we see her turning away from her vengeance plan in order to go see her brother. (Of course he\u2019s leaving Winterfell, and they\u2019ll likely miss each other completely. This is Game of Thrones; we can\u2019t have nice things.)\nBryan: I\u2019ll admit that I had a hard time staying focused on this scene when I initially watched because of the transition that precedes it. You know, the really pleasant one, where Samwell rips off a layer of Jorah Mormont\u2019s greyscaled skin, and leans in for a closer look \u2014 just so director Mark Mylod can cut to a close-up of a gushy, nasty pie crust being lanced like a wart. I don\u2019t know what it is with the season thus far, but if the goal is to rack up the most stomach-churning cuts possible, this transition and last week\u2019s game of Is it stew or human waste? are doing a bang-up job.\nAs for the scene itself: I was struck by the way Arya, on her way out, puts her hand on Hot Pie\u2019s shoulder. Despite everything she\u2019s been through, Arya is eager (and perhaps ready) for human connection beyond vengeance and blood.\nThat likely means everything will end terribly for her, of course. At times it seems like Game of Thrones gives its characters hopes and dreams only so it can giggle cruelly while it rips them away. But even if it\u2019s just for a moment, seeing that sliver of hope restored in Arya\u2019s eyes means everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHBO\n\n\nFirst blood in a new war\nTasha: Arya adding a new entry to her quest-log was my favorite scene of the episode, but the final sequence was certainly much more important to the show. Daenerys sent Yara and Theon Grayjoy, and everyone\u2019s least favorite, kid-killing Dornish family (Ellaria Sand, her daughter Tyene, and Tyene\u2019s half-sisters Obara and Nymeria) off to blockade King\u2019s Landing. But Euron Greyjoy shows up, smashes their fleet, murders Obara and Nymeria, and captures Ellaria, Tyene, and probably Yara. (Some viewers online are assuming that the corpse hanging from the prow of their ship at the end of the episode is Yara, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s Nymeria, hanging from her own whip. The corpse pinned to the boat is Obara, run through with her own spear.) \nThis is the first scene I\u2019ve called out in one of our scene breakdowns that I actually hated. Not because of who dies \u2014 I\u2019ve always thought the Sand Snakes were poorly written and borderline intolerable, and this feels like the writers cleaning house and starting the bloodshed in the latest battle for Westeros at the same time. No, I hated the scene because it\u2019s so visually muddy that I could barely tell what was going on. Between the frantic editing, the wild camera movement, the darkness, and the motion-blur, there\u2019s no anticipation or tension or terror to the sequence. It\u2019s just crashing bodies, and occasionally some Euron crazy-eye. It\u2019s an important sequence, but I found it incredibly visually irritating. And Lord, let\u2019s please not let this show veer back into rape territory again, with a bunch of vulnerable women captured by leering men.\nBryan: It\u2019s definitely not the most coherently blocked sequence in the show\u2019s history, but I was just hung up on the sheer, dumb improbability of it all. Yara is supposed to have some savvy as a sailor and warrior, and yet Euron shows up out of nowhere, seemingly just feet from her ship, so he can conveniently board the vessel and wreak havoc. How are we supposed to believe he found them, exactly? Did the magic strobe lights that seem to be firing off behind his ship\u2019s sails have something to do with it \u2014 or was Euron just coming from a Nine Inch Nails show?\nAnd then there\u2019s Theon. I know we, as the audience, are supposed to be frustrated by his decision to jump off the ship here, just as we were frustrated by his complete and utter Reek-ness when he was being tortured by Ramsay Bolton. And I recognize that just like his time with the Boltons, this act of cowardly self-preservation may be setting up some future reversal or opportunity for redemption. But at this point I\u2019m just so exhausted by Theon Greyjoy that I wish the show would be done with him. The minute things started going awry, it seemed a given that this would come down to Theon and that he would let Yara down \u2014 and, yep, that\u2019s exactly what happened.\nI\u2019m fine with him being a broken man who is utterly useless, and I actually have great sympathy for the character given what he\u2019s undergone. Alfie Allen\u2019s face is wonderful in this sequence as he looks around and witnesses the violence happening around him; you can practically see his focus drain away as PTSD overtakes him. But at a certain point, he\u2019s such an obvious liability that I can\u2019t help but yell at the TV for people counting on him in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nHaven\u2019t had any good torture in a while\nTasha: Speaking of places we\u2019d rather the show didn\u2019t go, the sequence where Sam Tarly sets out to cure Jorah\u2019s greyscale by cutting it off his body feels like a callback to Ramsay Bolton\u2019s nigh-endless torture of Theon. Dear Game of Thrones showrunners: it was honestly enough to have Sam hand Jorah a huge-ass skin of rum and tell him the procedure would be painful. Having him offer Jorah a belt to bite, and visually lingering over the cutting tools, and having him beg Jorah not to scream \u2014 that was all redundant. And then the grotesque skinning scene, lingering over Jorah\u2019s muffled shrieks and those foley noises \u2014 Game of Thrones has always struggled with its fluid tone, but these dips into torture porn are the most jarring and unnecessary. \nAnd yet, I was jazzed about the meat of this sequence (forgive the pun) because once again, Sam weighs what he\u2019s been told to do against what he thinks is right, and he commits to the latter. And he does this, despite the fact that he\u2019s risking his life by exposing himself to greyscale, risking getting booted from Oldtown, and could very well kill Jorah in a grotesque way. Last week\u2019s horrific poop-and-soup montage is a reminder that Sam, dismissed by his father as craven and weak at the beginning of the series, has gradually earned a place among the series\u2019s greatest heroes. He\u2019s quietly turned into a brave man who may literally gag over his duty, but still toughs it out and does the right thing. Here, he\u2019s honoring his old mentor Jeor the only way he can, and his loyalty does him credit. \nBryan: I had a slightly different read on this, because I actually found the descaling scene to be rather hilarious. It\u2019s a comedy of errors from the start: Jorah asking Samwell if he\u2019s ever done this before, followed by Samwell\u2019s long, drawn-out pause; the preposterous notion that Sam is pulling crusty, pus-laden skin off Jorah while he\u2019s supposed to keep nice and quiet so the neighbors won\u2019t hear. It gets to a point where Sam is literally sawing at Jorah\u2019s flesh as a last resort, unable to get that final piece off \u2014 while Jorah comically grunts and moans.\nTaken at face value, it\u2019s obviously horrible and gross. But thought of as absurd comedy \u2014 just imagine Bruce Campbell as Jorah, and how that would change the way the scene reads on a gut level \u2014 and you\u2019ve got a gross-out comedy sequence that is funny as it is horrid. I mentioned the transition to the pie earlier, and that for me is the true tell of how this scene was intended. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not tough to watch (obviously it threw me), and it doesn\u2019t mean this attempt was completely successful. But there\u2019s a weird new strain of humor in Game of Thrones this season, and I\u2019m appreciating the way it\u2019s trying to keep some of the misery of this world at arm\u2019s length. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Macall B. Polay / HBO\n\n\nSweet love\nTasha: On the other end of the spectrum from gory torture-cures, we have Grey Worm and Missandei finally consummating their relationship, and it\u2019s about damn time. I\u2019m honestly at a loss to come up with the last time Game of Thrones spent this much time on a sex scene that wasn\u2019t violent, coercive, degrading, transactional, or interrupted by something awful happening. This sequence was actually shot with tenderness, respect, and affection! Add on the fact that Game of Thrones barely has any characters of color, and the few it has are usually slaves, victims, or both, and this sequence of two people (both former slaves, in fact) taking something personal for themselves without needing anyone\u2019s permission becomes a welcome relief. I\u2019m really hoping this scene doesn\u2019t just exist to set up one of them to mourn the other\u2019s death. Sorry for being cynical, but that\u2019s how Game of Thrones rolls, and fantasy stories in general aren\u2019t much better about it.\nBut I also enjoyed this sequence for Grey Worm\u2019s speech, giving us a little more of his history and going into further depth about his conflicted behavior toward Missandei. There are a fair number of barriers to their relationship, even apart from the obvious physical one he faces in being a eunuch. But for the moment, at least, they get to consensually enjoy each other without outside interference or judgment, which is more than most sexually active people in Westeros get to say.\nBryan: The beauty of this sequence was how it acknowledged and embraced a quality that has all but disappeared from the show\u2019s lead characters: vulnerability. Grey Worm tries to stop Missandei from taking off his clothes because he is very clearly worried about how she\u2019ll react when she sees the physical evidence of him having been turned into a eunuch. She simply doesn\u2019t care, saying that she wants to see him, and he finally relents.\nIt is a moment of absolute trust from a warrior who is supposed to be immune to such concerns; the singular focus is the reason the Unsullied are supposed to be such a fabled fighting force in the first place. But here he follows Missandei\u2019s lead and drops his guard completely and utterly, another reminder that beneath the horror and the war and the violence, these are simply people with hopes, dreams, and fears of their own. The game of thrones may turn the major players into monsters, but not everyone in this world is like that. Some still understand hope, and love, and respect, and this scene is a reminder of the very real human stakes in play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Helen Sloan / HBO\n\n\nTo kill a dragon\nTasha: There are so many strategy sessions in this episode, and I love them all: Daenerys calling Varys on the carpet to defend his history of betrayal. Olenna giving Dany a little motherly \u201cfuck \u2018em all, do what you want\u201d advice. Jon once again telling his council, \u201cSit down and shut up, I\u2019m the king,\u201d then handing the North to Sansa, who hopefully from here on gets to make wise decisions instead of eternally scolding Jon for his. Jaime trying to get Randyll Tarly on his side, and getting a righteous shaming about oathbreaking. And above all for me, Tyrion laying out a sensible, well-considered plan of attack that takes into account exactly what his sister\u2019s going to pull out as her go-to plan against Daenerys. Cersei\u2019s been doing better with alliance-building and thinking ahead lately, but Tyrion\u2019s still the well-read master strategist, and he\u2019s got her number.\nBut of all the planning sessions, my favorite was Qyburn reminding Cersei that while dragons are immensely powerful weapons, they aren\u2019t invulnerable or unkillable. That shot of Cersei walking up to the immense skull of Balerion, the Black Dread, is a shocking reminder of the scale of dragons. (It\u2019s also a nice callback to season 1, episode 5, when Arya hid in one of these dragon skulls and eavesdropped on Varys and Illyrio plotting against her father.) There are a lot of history notes in this week\u2019s episode, but the best of them may be the reminder that the Iron Throne itself was forged in Balerion\u2019s fiery breath. But the reveal of the dragon-slaying crossbow is just as shocking. Never mind the silly demo \u2014 anyone can shoot a stationary skull, Qyburn \u2014 the size of that thing is intimidating all on its own. Still, I appreciate that Qyburn took the time to have the thing loaded and aimed so Cersei could fire it, and have the kind of satisfying moment of power that keeps her impressed with Qyburn\u2019s resourcefulness and loyalty.\nBryan: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coincidence or an actual element we\u2019ll be seeing throughout the season, but the constant strategy sessions are thus far making this feel like the most coherent Game of Thrones season in years. There\u2019s a lot of exposition in both of these episodes thus far, but the show\u2019s writers are doing an excellent job of masking the moments in drama and character. It has rarely felt like they\u2019re telling us what the rules of the game are; it\u2019s always about another character learning, while we just happen to watch. \nThat said, I did feel that the seams showed for a brief moment in this episode, mostly revolving around the topic of Theon and Yara. Tyrion pitches his big plan, which relies on the Dornish army aligning with the Tyrells to lay siege to King\u2019s Landing. That will isolate Cersei, while Grey Worm and the Unsullied will simultaneously head out to capture Casterly Rock. It\u2019s so crazy, it just might work \u2014 the swelling score when Tyrion lays it out dictates exactly how we\u2019re supposed to be feel  \u2014 but the rules are almost too streamlined for their own good. The moment the show cuts to Yara and Ellaria, it\u2019s obvious that something is going to happen to interfere with their mission. Of course, I don\u2019t expect things to go smoothly all the time \u2014 I know full well what show I\u2019m watching \u2014 but in this particular case it felt more like a telegraphed set-up for an easy fall than the sleight of hand it could have been. \nBonus scene: Lassie come home\nTasha: It\u2019d definitely be excessive to have two Arya scenes in our breakdown, especially since no one dies in either one, no plots are wrapped up, and no thrones are gamed. But I still have to give a bit of a shoutout to the long-awaited reunion of Arya and Nymeria, as Ayra heads home toward Winterfell and Nymeria does her the honor of not devouring her. For dire wolves, that\u2019s some serious loyalty. I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re going to see more of Nymeria now that she knows Arya\u2019s in her territory \u2014 she\u2019s a solid deux ex machina, waiting in the wings to bite the ass off anyone who messes with her personal Stark.\nSo much of \u201cStormborn\u201d is about loyalty \u2014 the bond between Tyrion and Jon, between Randyll Tarly and the Tyrells, between Varys and the people of Westeros (driving all his decisions as he repeatedly abandons his other sworn loyalties in order to serve the realm), between Sam and Jeor, and so forth. There\u2019s an extra little emotional heart-nudge here, as we\u2019re reminded that nothing is as loyal as a faithful hound, even if that hound is a prehistoric monster-wolf. Nymeria re-entering the picture and recognizing Arya is like Argos recognizing Odysseus at the end of the Odyssey, except the dire wolf doesn\u2019t immediately die afterward. There\u2019s still a lot of story left to teach Arya about trust and friendship. And also possibly the vicious mauling of Arya\u2019s future enemies.\nBryan: What you just said. Plus one other really important thing: that dog got big.\n\nLEARNING GAME OF THRONES THEME SONG ON A FUTURISTIC KEYBOARD\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
