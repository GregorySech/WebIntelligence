{"title": "NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft will stay in its long orbit for the remainder of its mission", "content": " \nOn Friday, NASA announced that it Juno spacecraft would remain in its current 53-day orbit of Jupiter for the duration of its mission. The decision is a new setback for the spacecraft, which was scheduled to shift to a shorter, 14 day orbital schedule. \nThis isn\u2019s the first time that Juno has run into issues orbiting Jupiter. In October, NASA delayed an orbit around the planet due to a pair of helium check valves not working properly. While the spacecraft has since completed two additional orbits \u2014 the latest was on February 2nd \u2014 the mission\u2019s planners were concerned that \u201canother main engine burn could result in a less-than-desirable orbit,\u201d explained Rick Nybakken, Juno project manager at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \nThe change means fewer orbits of the planet\nJuno\u2019s 53-day orbit is highly elliptical, taking the spacecraft within 2,600 miles of the atmosphere to five million miles away, which helps the spacecraft minimize its exposure to the planet\u2019s radiation belts. In a shorter orbit, the spacecraft would have completed 33 orbits. The decision to keep Juno in its present orbit will help reduce the chances of something going wrong, but it also means that Juno will be able to conduct fewer orbits. The next flyby is scheduled to take place on March 27th. \nDespite the change, NASA noted that it will be able to do some additional work that wasn\u2019t originally planned, such as exploring the planet\u2019s magnetosphere. The decision to keep Juno in its current orbit will also limit its exposure to Jupiter\u2019s radiation. \u201cThis is significant,\u201d Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio explained, \u201cbecause radiation has been the main life-limiting factor for Juno.\u201d \nCurrently, Juno is scheduled to fly through July 2018 for 12 additional orbits, and mission planners will evaluate extending its life. Once the mission is over, the spacecraft will be de-orbited and will burn up in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere to avoid any potential contamination of the Jovian moons.  \n"}
