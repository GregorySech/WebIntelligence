{"title": "Verizon is killing Tumblr\u2019s fight for net neutrality", "content": " \nIn 2014, Tumblr was on the front lines of the battle for net neutrality. The company stood alongside Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Vimeo, Reddit, and Netflix during Battle for the Net\u2019s day of action. Tumblr CEO David Karp was also part of a group of New York tech CEOs that met with then-FCC chairman Tom Wheeler in Brooklyn that summer, while the FCC was fielding public comment on new Title II rules. President Obama invited Karp to the White House to discuss various issues around public education, and in February 2015 The Wall Street Journal reported that it was the influence of Karp and a small group of liberal tech CEOs that swayed Obama toward a philosophy of internet as public utility. \nBut three years later, as the battle for net neutrality heats up once again, Tumblr has been uncharacteristically silent. The last mention of net neutrality on Tumblr\u2019s staff blog \u2014 which frequently posts about political issues from civil rights to climate change to gun control to student loan debt \u2014 was in June 2016. And Tumblr is not listed as a participating tech company for Battle for the Net\u2019s next day of action, coming up in three weeks.\nTumblr has been uncharacteristically silent\nA representative for Battle for the Net told The Verge in an email, \u201cOutreach for the day of action is very much an active and ongoing process... I wouldn't read too much into who is and isn't on the list so far.\u201d Still, a rep for Tumblr declined to comment on whether the company would be participating, and AOL\u2019s senior VP of brand communications Caroline Campbell responded to an inquiry about whether Tumblr would maintain its stance on net neutrality, writing \u201c[It's] just too early to answer your question.\u201d \nWhen a company and a CEO have a reputation for being loud, silence says something.\nKarp is still outspoken on other issues that matter to him, however. He is on the board of Planned Parenthood, and Tumblr hosted a \u201cNever Going Back\u201d rally at SXSW this year, protesting renewed threats on reproductive rights. He published a joint statement with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards on The Verge, and has been extremely outspoken about his belief that tech industry leaders are obligated to step in to defend federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, Karp\u2019s only public comment about net neutrality since the 2016 election was a quote he gave to Variety as an aside at SXSW in March: \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken to see the sea change on net neutrality.\u201d\nOne reason for Karp and Tumblr\u2019s silence? Last week Verizon completed its acquisition of Tumblr parent company Yahoo, kicking off the subsequent merger of Yahoo and AOL to create a new company called Oath. As one of the world\u2019s largest ISPs, Verizon is notorious for challenging the principles of net neutrality \u2014 it sued the FCC in an effort to overturn net neutrality rules in 2011, and its general counsel Kathy Grillo published a note this April complimenting new FCC chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to weaken telecommunication regulations.\nNow, multiple sources tell The Verge that employees are concerned that Karp has been discouraged from speaking publicly on the issue, and one engineer conveyed that Karp told a group of engineers and engineering directors as much in a weekly meeting that took place shortly after SXSW. \u201cKarp has talked about the net neutrality stuff internally, but won\u2019t commit to supporting it externally anymore,\u201d the engineer said. \u201c[He] assures [us] that he is gonna keep trying to fight for the ability to fight for it publicly.\u201d Karp did not respond to four emails asking for comment, and neither Yahoo nor Tumblr would speak about the matter on the record. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Olivier Douliery-Pool / Getty Images\n\n\nOn the day Verizon\u2019s Yahoo acquisition was completed, Tumblr was hit by a wave of layoffs. A number of current and former employees shared a post by social media industry commentator Andr\u00e9a L\u00f3pez entitled \u201cLayoffs and Tumblr the Centipede.\u201d In it, L\u00f3pez theorizes, \u201cIn addition to the real life talented human beings impacted by these layoffs, the move is a warning and reminder \u2014 Tumblr is no longer in the protective purgatory of pre-Verizon Yahoo.\u201d If Mayer\u2019s Yahoo didn\u2019t really know what it was doing with Tumblr, that meant Tumblr was free to do what it wanted. That extended to politics: Yahoo didn\u2019t give Tumblr any official blessing or encouragement when it decided to become the tech industry\u2019s fiercest net neutrality defender three years ago. Now things are a little bit stickier.\nBryan Irace, an engineering manager who worked at Tumblr from March 2012 to November 2015, explained Tumblr\u2019s culture to The Verge in an email, writing, \u201cWe all [participated]. As with many other causes (e.g. SOPA/PIPA), [net neutrality] was a huge part of the company culture. A free and open Internet was a prerequisite for Tumblr to grow from an idea in David\u2019s head into the platform that it is today... During my tenure there, Tumblr never shied away from speaking out about causes that the team collectively believed in.\u201d\naggression on net neutrality \u201cstops at leadership\u201d\nBut a former employee who recently left Tumblr told The Verge that some employees who wanted to work there because of its culture of community and activism have been feeling uneasy for at least the last several weeks because of what they feel is a shift in Tumblr\u2019s priorities. \n\u201cSome of our previous stances on issues that are really important to Tumblr employees and its community are being silenced,\u201d said the former employee. \u201cWe've been really noisy about things like net neutrality in the past. We asked the new Head, Simon Khalaf, about it in an all-hands a few weeks ago and he said it was \u2018not his problem\u2019 and \u2018above his pay grade.\u2019\u201d A current employee and another former employee corroborated this account. \nSimon Khalaf is the former CEO of Flurry, an analytics app that was acquired by Yahoo in 2014. Under Yahoo, Khalaf was given a myriad of responsibilities related mostly to mobile app development and publishing partners \u2014 including Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, and Tumblr. He was promoted to senior VP in April 2015, then tapped by Oath CEO Tim Armstrong to head Media Brands and Products. Karp now reports directly to Khalaf.\nThe Verge spoke to two former employees and one current employee about net neutrality advocacy at the company. One former employee said that the \u201cwhole org\u201d is still aggressive on net neutrality and other progressive causes \u2014 but that aggression \u201cstops at leadership.\u201d\nIn addition, at the all-hands meeting at Tumblr last month, all three sources say Khalaf gave a speech that shocked much of the staff. One source described the talk as \u201ca whole bunch of terrible, shitty corporate speak,\u201d in which Khalaf used military metaphors to explain how Tumblr could use content as \u201ca weapon\u201d to beat out its competition. \nTwo former Tumblr employees said they were alarmed when Khalaf chose Black Lives Matter as an example of a community that the company should focus on converting into Yahoo media consumers. One told The Verge, \u201cSimon explicitly said that Black Lives Matter was an opportunity to [make] a ton of money.\u201d The same person also recalled: \u201cTumblr employees totally freaked, but couldn't really be vocal about it because we were in [New York City] watching over video cast.\u201d The other said that the meeting was \u201cextremely uncomfortable\u201d and \u201ca lot of people were really upset,\u201d leading to a heated conversation in Tumblr\u2019s Slack, which is separate from Yahoo\u2019s. \nOne Tumblr engineer did not recall the statement about Black Lives Matter, but remembered staffers discussing the generally \u201ceyebrow-raising\u201d all-hands in Slack, as well as the conversation turning into \u201ca huge mess.\u201d That conversation got back to Khalaf, and it fell to Karp to discipline the Tumblr staff in a weekly meeting. Khalaf did not respond to a request for comment, but a source close to him wanted it noted that Black Lives Matter was only one \u201ccommunity\u201d that Khalaf referenced: he also discussed Game of Thrones and Manchester United fans.\nAsked whether progressive politics were still a powerful force at Tumblr, Ari Levine, who worked as Tumblr\u2019s brand strategist from July 2012 to November 2014, told The Verge in a phone call, \u201cI imagine that remains innate on some level. But without question the people that saw their role at Tumblr as being able to empower change and be a voice and motivate the community to be a voice in a meaningful way, those people are gone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr dashboard on Battle for the Net\u2019s 2014 day of action.\n\n\nThere has been a notable exodus of many of the individuals who spearheaded Tumblr\u2019s net neutrality activism. That includes employees like former public policy lead Liba Rubenstein (now at 21st Century Fox) and general counsel Ari Shahdadi (now at BuzzFeed), who collaborated on Tumblr\u2019s first major actions in support of net neutrality. Katherine Barna, head of communications at Tumblr since March 2011, left the company this month, writing that her biggest accomplishments during that time included \u201csaving net neutrality for a minute there.\u201d It\u2019s not an overstatement: Tumblr even went to court to defend net neutrality in 2015, alongside the other NYC startups it had built an alliance with the year before, and tech policy lawyer Marvin Ammori told Motherboard at the time, \u201cNo companies deserve more credit than the New York tech community for the victory at the FCC.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to note that the 2017 and 2014 battles for net neutrality are very different \u2014 even when completely divorced from Verizon\u2019s involvement at Tumblr. Defenders of the open internet are facing a far more antagonistic FCC and Congress, as well as a president who does not seem to know what net neutrality is, and is far more likely to ignore the issue completely than invite David Karp back to the White House. \nWhether or not Karp comes out in support of net neutrality, all of the employees we spoke with were still adamant about fighting for the cause. \u201cWe all love Tumblr and actually really care about its future and community,\u201d said one former employee. \u201cMany of the people who are still there are good people trying to do the right thing.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
