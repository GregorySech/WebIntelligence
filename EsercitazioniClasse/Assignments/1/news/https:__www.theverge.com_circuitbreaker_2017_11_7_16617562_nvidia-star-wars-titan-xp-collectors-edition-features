{"content": " Nvidia is creating special versions of its powerful Titan Xp graphics card for fans of the Jedi Order or Galactic Empire. The two collector\u2019s edition Star Wars GPUs have been designed to fit into the Star Wars universe, with hints of a lightsaber or light panels that look like the Death Star. There are bright green LEDs for the light side or a moody red version for the dark side, and both have subtle design differences for Star Wars fans.Both cards have windowed areas to show off the lighting and internals, so they\u2019ll look great inside a custom gaming PC that you can peek inside of. The GPUs use Nvidia\u2019s Pascal-based Titan Xp architecture, meaning there\u2019s 3,840 CUDA cores running at 1.6GHz and 12GB of GDDR5X memory running at 11.4Gbps. That\u2019s 12 teraflops of power, double the graphics capabilities of the new Xbox One X. Grid ViewAll of that power comes at a price, though. Nvidia is releasing these special Star Wars cards in mid-November priced at $1,200 each, and strangely there\u2019s no copy of Star Wars Battlefront II bundled in the box. Each edition comes with a special metal badge to show off a Star Wars allegiance, just in case the bright green or red LEDs weren\u2019t enough.", "title": "Nvidia has created powerful Star Wars graphics cards"}
