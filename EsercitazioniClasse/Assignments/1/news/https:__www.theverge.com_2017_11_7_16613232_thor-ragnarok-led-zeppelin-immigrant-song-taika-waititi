{"title": "Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi had to have this Led Zeppelin song", "content": " Even for those who aren\u2019t fans of classic \u201870s rock, Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cImmigrant Song\u201d is instantly recognizable. It starts off with driving drums and rousing guitar chords that build into its iconic battle howl, \u201cAh-ah, ah!\u201d Originally inspired by the band\u2019s time in Iceland, the lyrics spin a tale of Norse mythology and viking fantasy involving great battles and the Hammer of the Gods. \u201cValhalla, I am coming!\u201d wails Robert Plant.It sounds like a perfect fit for Marvel\u2019s blockbuster Thor movies about the hammer-wielding Norse thunder god, which is why Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi was so insistent about getting it in his film \u2014 but landing the rights was no easy feat. It took the film\u2019s music supervisor Dave Jordan the entire length of the production to get the go-ahead from Led Zeppelin, Waititi told Business Insider. Led Zeppelin is notoriously selective about licensing its songs for films and television, and \u201cImmigrant Song\u201d has only made its way into a select few, including School of Rock.  That also took some doing. \u201cWithout that song, this movie will crumble into smithereens.\u201dBack in 2003, School of Rock star Jack Black recorded a heartfelt plea in front of a live audience where he begged Led Zeppelin to give its blessing. Calling them \u201cthe gods of rock\u201d and \u201cthe greatest band of all time,\u201d he told the musicians that \u201cthis is a movie about rock. And without that song, this movie will crumble into smithereens.\u201d It worked, and the rights were granted.The Los Angeles Times reported in 2012 that Led Zeppelin\u2019s asking fee for licensing just one of its songs was within the seven-figure ballpark. Although it\u2019s gotten a bit easier in the past decade for filmmakers, and even fashion and video game brands, to get the rights to Led Zeppelin\u2019s songs, the band is still extremely selective. The deals have to be lucrative, and it requires a lot of time and persistence.Waititi\u2019s vision for Thor: Ragnarok included \u201cImmigrant Song\u201d from the start, so he was willing to wait. Back in 2015, before the New Zealand director was even hired for the project, he included \u201cImmigrant Song\u201d in an early sizzle reel for Marvel executives. At the meeting, Marvel Studios\u2019 president Kevin Feige loved it immediately, and said it would be perfect for the film.Even so, the rights didn\u2019t come cheap; Waititi was fortunate to have Marvel Studios\u2019 parent company Disney foot the bill. \"I have a feeling if you want to entertain that idea of using [Led Zeppelin\u2019s] music, you have to have the money,\" he said. \"No negotiations. Offer it to them straight up... they are worth it.\u201d"}
