{"title": "The Game of Game of Thrones: season 7, episode 2, Stormborn", "content": " \nI\u2019m going to address something right now, and then we\u2019re not going to talk about it again for the rest of our lives: it is strange to watch the men tasked with writing Game of Thrones attempt to write intimacy that is not twisted in some way. And so this week\u2019s sex scene between Grey Worm and Missandei was both touching and embarrassing. Grey Worm comparing the feeling of being in love with Missandei with a child\u2019s fear of snakes or the ocean was a clumsy rhetorical choice on his part, and Missandei\u2019s \u201cI want to see you, please\u201d made me want to throw myself off a building. But I\u2019m happy these two kids finally got it together long enough to take it all off. This is the first consensual, romantic sex depicted on Game of Thrones since April 2013, which is remarkable for a show known in some circles as tacky high-fantasy erotica. \nThat\u2019s pretty tragic in its own way, and particularly in the context of this episode. Even more particularly, it\u2019s tragic given that \u201cStormborn\u201d is the 11th episode written by Bryan Cogman, whose most famous work on this show so far was the season 5 episode \u201cUnbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,\u201d depicting Sansa Stark\u2019s wedding night with Ramsay Bolton. I hope we\u2019re not witnessing this long-delayed gratification for G+M solely as a prelude to one of their deaths being imbued with some extra pathos. In the excitement of yelling \u201cfire and blood!\u201d at my MacBook every Sunday night, I often forget how deeply, serially sad this show is. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, what I really want is for no one to use any of Grey Worm or Missandei\u2019s come-on tactics for personal use, or ever again on a television program. Please don\u2019t say \u201cYou are my weakness,\u201d to people! That\u2019s not a good compliment! And we all deserve better in a world where ice zombies and magical fire pirates are possible. There, we did it, our serious discussion for the week. \nThank goodness, because this episode really delivered on the premise of \u201crated TV-MA for graphic violence and strong sexual content,\u201d and we have a ton of points to give out. Not just for our young lovers (who we\u2019ll come back to), but for a whole mess of murder.\nthis is the \u2018game of thrones\u2019 you know and love: sex and murder\nHere we go, and I\u2019m sorry. \nEpisode 2 opens with a thunderstorm on Dragonstone that has Daenerys in a funk. She\u2019s already decided Westeros \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like home,\u201d because of all the rain, and probably because of the fact that she has yet to see a single living person that she didn\u2019t bring with her. On the enormous interactive Westeros map Stannis left behind, Dany sees two Monopoly pieces shaped like lions and says, \u201cAh, not so many lions.\u201d This is how war councils happen to this day, I assume.\nMore or less, she and Tyrion just want to come up with a plan by which they do the winning part of war without the killing anyone part of war, which is commendable in the abstract but seems unlikely to actually happen. We\u2019re in a graphic violence and strong sexual content show! They don\u2019t put those warnings there for nothing!\nHere, due to cabin fever, Dany spontaneously turns on Varys and really lays into him about how many different kings he\u2019s been willing to serve, and the fact that he was definitely involved in the assassination plot against her back in season 1. This whole debate was fairly boring, but it sets Varys up for a withering line (+10): \u201cIncompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have eyes, I\u2019ll use them.\u201d \n\n\nYoooooo!! Varys just gave the \"color purple\" \"I had to fight all my life\" speech!! He choose you QWERN!!!! pic.twitter.com/gfuCTwgdBj\u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) July 24, 2017\n\n\n\nDaenerys respects it, but it does nothing to lighten her mood, and I suppose I have to award her a +10 for the Daddy Aerys-inspired line, \u201cIf you ever betray me, I\u2019ll burn you alive.\u201d I know plenty of people can\u2019t wait for Dany to be queen, but the dragon-fire trump card she\u2019s constantly halfway through pulling out of her back pocket sort of makes her act like a child celebrity who would put 24 alkaline water bottles and six cream sodas on their tour rider.\nAt this point, Melisandre rolls up in Dragonstone and pitches our secular queen on the concept of the Lord of Light, broadly, and the concept of her and Jon Snow as the prince and princess that were promised, more specifically. It\u2019s interesting to me that Dany doesn\u2019t have any follow-up questions about the ice-zombie war Melisandre is attempting to enlist her for, but at Tyrion\u2019s recommendation, she invites Jon to come hang out, talk shop, and oh yeah, \u201cbend the knee.\u201d \nHere, we get a quick cut to Winterfell, where Jon is reading this letter. (We really don\u2019t give the ravens of Westeros enough credit for being the fastest and most accurate postal service in the history of civilizations both real and fictional.) Jon isn\u2019t sure he wants to get involved with a woman with a bunch of dragons, which he\u2019s heard are dangerous, when he\u2019s got so many White Walkers to worry about killing. Davos literally says \u201cWhite Walkers can be killed with fire. What breathes fire?\u201d and we\u2019re out of here. \nhmm, what breathes fire? great question by Ser Davos\nIn King\u2019s Landing, Cersei is lecturing Randyll Tarly and Sam\u2019s brother Dickon (a new free agent for our player pool) about how they\u2019re going to need to betray Our Eternal Hero Olenna Tyrell and help her fight Daenerys, who\u2019s a vicious dictator with a bunch of fire-monsters on her side. Unfortunately, the atrocities Cersei is accusing Dany of \u2014 mass crucifixions, feeding political enemies to her dragons \u2014 actually happened. Huh. Also, unbeknownst to Cersei, Daenerys just threatened to burn one of her core advisors to death. \nThen Randyll makes a case for himself as the dark-horse fantasy league pick of the year. Jaime follows him outside and pitches him on a job opening: be his general (+25), his second-in-command, and when the war is over, Randyll can have Olenna\u2019s job as Warden of the South. Ever the quietly sociopathic student athlete with an immaculate jawline, Jaime sells this as an opportunity to kill \u201cforeign savages and eunuchs.\u201d Randyll seems like he\u2019s in (and we sure do know that he\u2019s a racist), but not before laying a sharp burn on the Lannister family, bragging that the Tarlys, who do threaten to murder their own children, at the very least \u201cdon\u2019t stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.\u201d (+10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nWe\u2019re jumping all over the place this episode, and here, we take a quick trip to the Citadel for a two-minute scene of Archmaester Marwyn explaining to Jorah that he has 10 to 20 years before the greyscale kills him, but he\u2019ll go nuts in about six months. Marwyn\u2019s bedside manner isn\u2019t exactly commendable, and he has no medical advice other than \u201cYou should have cut your arm off.\u201d Rude! Jorah is given one day to contemplate suicide-by-sword before the Archmaester plans to ship him off to Valyria to die with the rest of the stone men. I know we are not being encouraged to root for this outcome, but with all our guys and gals finally united on the same continent, I\u2019m feeling a little claustrophobic. It could be a fun road trip / death sentence? \nWe\u2019re back in King\u2019s Landing before you can say \u201cThe feature-film debut of pop sensation Britney Spears,\u201d and it seems to me like we could have just stayed here and held off on the 90-second greyscale explainer video until later, but it\u2019s not my show. Cersei and Qyburn take a stroll through the Red Keep\u2019s basement collection of skulls, where he unveils his dragon-slaying plan: a sinister-looking mechanical crossbow loaded with an enormous spear, which he claims \u201cthe finest artisan blacksmiths in King\u2019s Landing\u201d have been working on for months. I don\u2019t know, I mean, it\u2019s just a crossbow loaded with a spear. It looks to be only about 1.5 times larger than the one Joffrey was using to pick off prostitutes six years ago. But it successfully shoots a centuries-old dragon skull that is sitting perfectly still\u2026 on the ground\u2026 about 15 feet away. Oh baby, here is a foolproof plan if I ever saw one. And artisanal! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nBack on Dragonstone, we\u2019re now in a second war council meeting with the full dream team \u2014 the usual Dany advisors, plus Yara and Theon Greyjoy, Ellaria Sand, and Olenna. The showdown between Tyrion and Ellaria over her murdering his teenage niece in cold blood last season is approximately four seconds long. There is really not much of a premium placed on the life of young women in this show, and we should all know that by now, so I\u2019m not going to dwell on it. Anyway, Tyrion\u2019s plan is to send the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock and shake up the Lannisters a little, while the Dornish and Tyrell armies lay siege to King\u2019s Landing, essentially just starving Cersei and her army into submission. The Dothraki are sidelined because he thinks Cersei would be able to weaponize everyone\u2019s racism against them too easily. I\u2019m not totally sure why they came to Westeros at all, in that case! This meeting drags on, but Olenna gets +5 for \u201cI\u2019ve known a great many clever men. I\u2019ve outlived them all. You know why? I ignored them.\u201d Nice. Me, too.\nAs much as we needed some Queen of Thorns comic relief, we also needed a heartwarming five minutes of beautiful people smooching. To that end, as we know: Missandei sneaks into Grey Worm\u2019s room in a dress that laces all the way up the front (respect) and tells him he better fess up to being in love with her right now before he possibly dies. Yeah, it\u2019s darlin\u2019. Missandei gets +25 for nudity of the \u201cwhole shebang\u201d variety, Greyworm gets +15 for a nude butt close-up, and they get another +15 each for finally throwing down. Whatever else Daenerys does or doesn\u2019t do to the Seven Kingdoms, it\u2019s too bad there\u2019s no mechanism in the Game of Game of Thrones rules that will allow me to give her some points for bringing Westeros its second-ever dude willing to go down on a lady.\nBack at the Citadel (who can I give a -500 for the utterly ridiculous sequencing of this episode?), Jorah is writing Daenerys a rueful love letter, and it\u2019s unclear who is going to agree to mail his toxic germs to the new self-proclaimed Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. He is like a walking 180 pounds of anthrax, and very, very sad. But luckily, Sam is now practicing experimental medicine. He and Jorah get +5 each for taking swigs of rum while discussing how best to violently rip off most of Jorah\u2019s skin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nFrom Jorah\u2019s oozing pus, we cut to a meat pie in Arya\u2019s favorite road pub. Hot Pie is there (another new free agent for our league). He is, as ever, delightful, and not only feeds Arya some free pie, but takes it upon himself to inform her that Jon took back Winterfell from the Boltons by winning \u201cThe Battle of the Bastards.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know we were calling it that in-universe! +5 to Arya for eating, and one little tear, roiling in the corner of my eye to Arya for deciding to abandon her murder plot and go home.\nSidebar: There is just way too much happening in this episode. I\u2019m kind of over it. We\u2019re back in Winterfell, where Jon has just gotten Sam\u2019s letter about dragonglass buried in Dragonstone. Again, I have to say: Uh-doy! Now convinced that he needs to go visit Daenerys right this second, Jon faces some pushback from Northern lords who really just got used to having a dad again. Sansa hates the idea, and provides a quick recap for the folks at home of what happened when her grandfather Rickard went off to serve a Targaryen. (He got roasted, uh-doy.) But she warms to it when Jon says he\u2019s going to leave her in charge (+25). My greatest dissatisfaction in life is that I have no way to award points for this masterfully executed \u201cWho me?\u201d face: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nSeconds later, in the crypts, Jon is having some quiet reflection time and staring at a statue of Ned when Littlefinger sidles up to tell him that he has a sick obsession with Catelyn Stark (who has been dead for four years) and Sansa Stark (who is a teenager). This seems poorly thought-out, but whatever plan Littlefinger is cooking up clearly doesn\u2019t require Jon or Sansa to like or trust him, and he\u2019s just trolling them whenever possible at this point. I\u2019m a little worried about why he\u2019s still in Winterfell, and why exactly he looks so\u2026 thrilled (?) when Jon nearly strangles him to death against a wall. He can get his kicks wherever he wants, but I\u2019d prefer it was off-camera.\nJon gets +15 for the death grip and +10 for \u201cTouch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d I am a little embarrassed that I found this display of violent masculinity and paternal posturing to be super satisfying, and I\u2019m only confessing it to you because Missandei and Grey Worm taught me to Speak My Truth even when it\u2019s disgusting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brings us to the episode\u2019s last scene, and its best: it\u2019s Nymeria! She\u2019s back, after Arya set her loose in the woods in season 1, and she gets a +25 for discovering herself and assembling a roving wolf militia in the process. Thank the Seven for letting us end on a high note. What a beautiful communion between girl and pet! Now we can rest easy and enjoy sweet dreams about cuddling with a pup the size of a small truck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nOh, I\u2019m sorry, I was just kidding! Next we will be suffering through 15 minutes of absurdity.\nWe open on Ellaria and Yara on their way to King\u2019s Landing, doing some heavy flirting (+5 each), drinking (+5 each), and making out in front of Theon, I guess just to be rude. In the ship\u2019s hull, the Sand Snakes are mocking each other and bragging some more about just how much they love murder. \nSuddenly, they\u2019re under attack. (Why is it that no one on this show ever has the ability to see an entire immense fleet until it\u2019s five feet away?) Euron Greyjoy, who is channeling the Tasmanian Devil, is hacking everyone to pieces and literally frothing at the mouth. It is very hard to see what\u2019s going on, thanks to the manic direction from Mark Mylod (he\u2019ll also be back for next week\u2019s episode), and some 300-inspired editing. I was into it, but my co-workers were not, and rightly pointed out in a Slack conversation that this scene looks like a back-door pilot for a crossover Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. At the very least, it got my heart rate up, and what else do you want from your Sunday night graphic violence? Uh, some points! Yara and Theon net +50 each for random kills. (I couldn\u2019t actually see, but they were both in the thick of the indecipherable fray for quite awhile.) Nym gets +10 for a random kill and Tyene gets +30 for the three kills she manages before she and her mother are taken hostage. \npirates 6: what is dead may never die \nThis dizzyingly fast hostile takeover spells doom for the plan Daenerys and Tyrion came up with in approximately three minutes. But more importantly: the god-awful Dorne plot comes to a god-awful end, with two Sand Snakes (Nym and Obara) teaming up against Euron and meeting gruesome, gory deaths inflicted by their own signature weapons. (+50 to each for dying memorably.) I would love it if someone could explain how these two women, trained from birth as formidable warriors and absolutely singularly defined by their desire to kill people, were defeated so easily by a man who has done nothing much beyond sailing around and beating up unarmed civilians his entire life. Is it just because he is crazy, and looks even more terrifying when backlit by sparks from the fire-launching weapons he somehow has? I am bound by duty to give him +50 for random kills, +25 for killing Nym, +25 for killing Obara, and +15 for taking Yara hostage.\nI don\u2019t really know what to say about Theon, drifting off into the ocean, staring up at the silhouettes of the Sand Snakes, who have already been laced up on the bow. I\u2019m so sorry, my guy, and I have no idea what your plan is from here. This show is very sad.\nCorrection: I am very sorry to report that I did not realize Harrag (one of the newly introduced Ironborn), was responsible for one random death and the capture of both Ellaria and Tyene Sand. +40 to him! Additionally, we missed one of Tyene\u2019s kills (+10), and that Theon and Obara both drank on screen (+5 each).\nCheck your scores on Fantasizr now!\nAnd don\u2019t forget to pick up some free agents to fill out the spots left by your dear departed.\n\nTHE VERGE LEAGUE STANDINGS:\n\nMICHAEL ZELENKO: 215 POINTS\nTop scorer: Obara Sand, 55\nSpecial team: The Royal Army, 0\nANDY HAWKINS: 165 POINTS\nTop scorer: Euron Greyjoy, 115\nSpecial team: The Unsullied, 0\nTC SOTTEK: 140 POINTS\nTop scorer: Nymeria Sand, 60\nSpecial team: Wildlings, 0\nLIZ LOPATTO: 105 POINTS\nTop scorer: Yara Greyjoy, 60\nSpecial team: The Lord of Light*, 0\n*Liz traded in the Old Gods last week\nKWAME OPAM: 100 POINTS\nTop scorer: Tyene Sand, 30\nSpecial team: The Dothraki, 0\nSARAH SMITHERS: 70 POINTS\nTop scorer: Varys, 10\nSpecial team: Dragons, 0\nLOREN GRUSH: 60 POINTS\nTop scorer: Theon Greyjoy, 55\nSpecial team: Brotherhood without Banners, 0\nTASHA ROBINSON: 45 POINTS\nTop scorer: Harrag, 40\nSpecial team: White Walkers, 0\nCHAIM GARTENBERG: 40 POINTS\nTop scorer: Randyll Tarly, 35\nSpecial team: Wights, 0\nBRYAN BISHOP: 20 POINTS\nTop scorer: Ellaria Sand, 15\nSpecial team: The Night\u2019s Watch, 0\n\nLEARNING GAME OF THRONES THEME SONG ON A FUTURISTIC KEYBOARD\n\n\n\n\n"}
