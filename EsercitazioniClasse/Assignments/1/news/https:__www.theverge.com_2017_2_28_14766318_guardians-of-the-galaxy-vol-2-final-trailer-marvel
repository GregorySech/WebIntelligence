{"title": "The final Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer is here and ready to rock", "content": " \nMarvel released the final trailer for the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on Jimmy Kimmel Live! tonight, giving fans a bit more of an idea of what to expect from the return of the galaxy\u2019s favorite band of misfit heroes. \nThe entire gang is back for this run: Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), along with new members of the team Yondu (Michael Rooker), Nebula (Karen Gillan), and Mantis (Pom Klementieff). Also returning is director James Gunn, who made the original film.\nOf particular note is the first appearance from a bearded Kurt Russel, revealed to be playing Star-Lord\u2019s mysterious father. \n\n\nBecause we love you.

Between the strong comedic elements and music, it\u2019s clear that Vol. 2  is definitely sticking to the franchise\u2019s guns (sometimes literally, in the case of Rocket Raccoon) when it comes to replicating the mix of humor and action that made the first film such a success.\nGuardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 hits theaters on May 5th.\n"}
