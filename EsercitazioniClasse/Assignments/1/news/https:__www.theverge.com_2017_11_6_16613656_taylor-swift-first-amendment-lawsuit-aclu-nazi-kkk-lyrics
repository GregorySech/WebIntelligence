{"title": "The ACLU defends blogger who linked Taylor Swift with white supremacy", "content": " \nThe ACLU of Northern California issued a press release today saying it intends to defend a blogger who has drawn the ire of Taylor Swift. \nOn October 25th, writer Meghan Herning received a letter from Swift\u2019s legal team demanding the removal and retraction of a blog post she wrote in September titled \u201cSwiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation.\u201d The post appeared on PopFront, a tiny pop culture blog with 78 Twitter followers.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nTaylor Swift\u2019s internet rulebook\nYou can track shifts in public perception of Taylor Swift via emoji use on Twitter\n\nThe post details how the online alt-right has latched onto Swift throughout her career, taking it upon themselves to dub her a white supremacist icon. From there, it dives into some textual analysis of Swift\u2019s recent single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d arguing that her lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your kingdom keys\u201d is similar in tone and message to \u201c\u2018We will not be replaced.\u201d Later, it describes a scene in one of Swift\u2019s music videos where \u201cTaylor lords over an army of models from a podium, akin to what Hitler had in Nazis Germany. The similarities are uncanny and unsettling.\u201d Herning concludes that \u201cit is hard to believe that Taylor had no idea that the lyrics of her latest single read like a defense of white privilege and white anger[.]\u201d\nThese are some pretty wild leaps of logic. Regardless, it\u2019s not a crime to make stupid arguments about the meaning of an artistic work. If it were, F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s estate would make a mint off of the essays of public high school students every year. The ACLU published the letter it sent to Swift\u2019s lawyers, which explains how the First Amendment works, and makes some questionable puns involving Swift\u2019s most popular songs. \n\u201cAs you no doubt appreciate, Ms. Swift, as a celebrity and household name, is a general public figure under the First Amendment... Thus, the statements on the blog are protected by the First Amendment unless they are demonstrably false and you can show that the author made them knowing that they were false or with reckless disregard as to whether they were false... Criticism is never pleasant, but a celebrity has to shake it off, even if the critique may damage her reputation.\u201d\nThe letter points out that opinions can\u2019t be considered defamation because they are \u201cnot capable of being proved true or false.\u201d\nThe original cease and desist from Swift\u2019s team also told Herning that she was legally obligated to keep the dispute a secret, claiming that publishing their correspondence would violate the Copyright Act. The ACLU called this a \u201cclumsy legal threat\u201d and \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d The writing in this portion of the letter is particularly barbed:\n\u201cIt is not without irony that at one point you ask that your \u2018letter stand as yet another unequivocal denouncement by Ms. Swift of white supremacy and the alt-right,\u2019 but then purport to forbid anybody from making the letter public.\u201d\nThe ACLU requested a response from Swift\u2019s team and an end to their threat of legal action by November 13th. Swift\u2019s career has already put her in the center of broad debates about the streaming age, white feminism, internet-era celebrity, and Instagram\u2019s anti-harassment efforts. Now she\u2019s decided to wade into the hot-button issue of free speech just as her fifth album Reputation prepares to drop this Friday. \nIts pre-released singles transparently address both her public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West and her problems with the media in general, serving up clunky burns like \u201cAll the liars are calling me one\u201d and \u201cthe world moves on, another day, another drama, drama / But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma.\u201d\n"}
