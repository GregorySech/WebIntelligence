{"title": "YouTube star Colin Furze turned a microwave into a video game console", "content": " \nInternet star and maker Colin Furze has built all sorts of crazy inventions for his YouTube channel, ranging from a working hoverbike to a homemade Iron Man suit built to withstand a barrage of fireworks. In his latest video, he\u2019s turned his microwave into a playable game console. \nHis new invention is the Play-o-Wave, a fully functional microwave with a screen mounted on it. He built a screen into the door, and included a set of inputs for a handheld controller in the body. He proceeded to demonstrate the device in action, cooking an onion with peanut butter for two minutes, while playing a simple biking video game. It\u2019s the perfect way to spent a couple of minutes in the event that you left your phone or tablet in the other room while making dinner. \nThe video is part of a series for his channel in which viewers write in and request certain inventions, solving random problems such as cold feet (solution: gas-powered slippers) to urgently needing tea (solution: thermite). This isn\u2019t even the first time that he\u2019s improved the humble microwave: in 2015 he built a Freezer-wave, which cools down something if you\u2019ve overheated it. \n\n"}
