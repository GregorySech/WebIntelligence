{"content": " The Nintendo Switch is great for a lot of things, but when it comes to playing retro games, you\u2019re better off looking at something like the SNES Classic than Nintendo\u2019s current-generation console. Or, if you\u2019re like Tim Lindquist, a hardware modder / electrical engineering student at Iowa State University, you build your own Switch-esque console, which through the power of open-source emulation software, can not only play retro Nintendo games, but basically any retro title you can imagine, via Hackaday.Image: Tim Lindquist  YouTube Lindquist\u2019s device \u2014 cleverly called the \u201cNintimdo RP\u201d \u2014 goes beyond being a simple Raspberry Pi emulator, though. Rather, like the actual Switch itself, its a full-fledged portable console. Lindquist\u2019s build is a custom 3D-printed case, built around the ever-popular Raspberry Pi with an additional micro-controller for connecting the physical button inputs to the main processor. And the whole thing runs off a 10,000mAh battery, rechargeable by MicroUSB. On the software side, the Nintimdo RP runs RetroPie, with the professional looking EmulationStation on top to give it a more polished feel.  The device even improves on the Switch in some waysThe device even improves on the Switch in some ways: there\u2019s a 7-inch touchscreen that\u2019s actually larger than the one on a real Switch. Ports are also improved \u2014 there\u2019s an HDMI port, which automatically shuts off the screen and switches the video to a TV when plugged in for a Switch-like experience, along with two regular USB ports for plugging in accessories  given that it\u2019s still running a version of Linux, you could even in theory plug in a mouse and keyboard and just use it as a computer . Image: Tim LindquistAll it\u2019s really missing are the removable Joy-Con controllers \u2014 and since those work with Bluetooth there\u2019s no reason why you couldn\u2019t use them with the Nintimdo RP, either. Lindquist has started to put up some of the source code and 3D models that you\u2019d need to make your own on Github, with a more complete tutorial in the works for the future, too.
