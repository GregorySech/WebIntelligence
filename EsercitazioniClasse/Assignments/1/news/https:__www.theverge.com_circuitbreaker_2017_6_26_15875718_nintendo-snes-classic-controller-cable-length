{"title": "The SNES Classic's controller cables are two feet longer than the NES Classic", "content": " \nThe upcoming SNES Classic from Nintendo fixes at least one problem from its 8-bit predecessor. Just like the NES Classic, the new mini console will feature a replica controller that\u2019s nearly identical to the original. But where the NES Classic controller was hampered by frustratingly short cables, Nintendo says that won\u2019t be the case with the SNES Classic. Instead, it will include a cord that\u2019s around five feet long, two feet longer than the NES. That\u2019s somewhat on the short side, but still a decent improvement \u2014 though of course there will likely be some aftermarket wireless options after the system launches in September. On the plus side, the SNES Classic will come bundled with two controllers, instead of one, for out-of-the-box multiplayer action.\n"}
