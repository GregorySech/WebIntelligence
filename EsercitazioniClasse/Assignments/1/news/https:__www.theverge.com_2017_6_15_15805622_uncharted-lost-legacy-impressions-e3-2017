{"title": "Uncharted: The Lost Legacy will be a longer-than-expected adventure", "content": " \nThe announcement of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy in December was a welcome surprise. But lower-than-usual pricing, combined with the relatively quick timing of the release, raised questions about how substantial the fifth installment of the series could be. Will The Lost Legacy have legs \u2014 or will it be one $40 afternoon? \nIt seems the game will be longer than at least some of us expected. \u201cIt\u2019s longer than some previous Uncharted games \u2014 and not as long as Uncharted 4,\u201d Shaun Escayg, creative director of the game, said in an interview with The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice, tight story. But it\u2019s an Uncharted game for sure. We\u2019re not even done yet \u2014 it\u2019s expanding as we talk.\u201d\nEscayg\u2019s comments came after a roughly 15-minute gameplay demo that showed the game\u2019s protagonist, the Uncharted 2 treasure hunter Chloe Frazer, team up with the mercenary Nadine Ross to battle through a massive archaeological site in India. Two months before the game\u2019s August 22nd release date, new details are emerging about what kind of game The Lost Legacy will be \u2014 and early indications are that it will be a solid entry in the franchise.\n\nThe E3 demo showed off the mix of gameplay that has made past installments so engaging: puzzle solving, action combat, storytelling, and death-defying platforming. (The platforms Chloe steps on are just as likely to collapse underneath her as they were for original series protagonist Nathan Drake.) It also showed off the only plot that Uncharted has ever given us: a treasure hunter seeking an ancient relic, a murderous thug hot on their trail, and a series of narrow escapes leading to a big climax.\nDespite the redundant plots, Uncharted has stood out for the depth of the relationships it depicts \u2014 especially in last year\u2019s Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End. That game depicted Drake\u2019s evolving relationship with his brother, Sam, within uncommon skill, and left fans hoping that Chloe\u2019s relationship with Nadine \u2014 who was introduced in A Thief\u2019s End \u2014 will be just as central to The Lost Legacy.\nA story focused on relationships\nEscayg says Naughty Dog decided to do a spinoff with those two characters based entirely on the creative potential in them arguing. Chloe is \u201ca thieving, wheeling, dealing hustler,\u201d Escayg says, in contrast to Nadine\u2019s more pragmatic bruiser. \u201cIt felt like the perfect brew of combat,\u201d he says. They\u2019ve come together as part of a search for the Tusk of Ganesha, a mystical artifact hidden somewhere in the Western Ghats mountain range.\nOnly Chloe is playable in the story, he says, but Nadine \u201cis very intertwined.\u201d During the E3 demo, Nadine does a lot of tough talking and takes out several enemies to help clear Chloe\u2019s path \u2014 while still expressing annoyance with Chloe all along. \nEscayg says the team tried to bring together their favorite elements of Uncharted for The Lost Legacy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a sense of wonder, of scale and adventure, of discovering something new,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the sum of everything.\u201d\nUncharted: The Lost Legacy is scheduled to be released August 22nd on PlayStation 4.\n\n"}
