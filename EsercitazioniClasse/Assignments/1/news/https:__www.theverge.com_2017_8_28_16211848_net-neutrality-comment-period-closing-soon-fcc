{"title": "You have three days left to comment on the FCC\u2019s plan to kill net neutrality", "content": " \nAfter four months of debate, the FCC is nearly ready to stop accepting feedback on its proposal to kill net neutrality. Final comments are due this Wednesday, August 30th, by end-of-day Eastern time.\nOnce the comment period closes, the FCC will review the feedback it received and use it as guidance to revise its proposal, which if passed, would reverse the Title II classification that guaranteed net neutrality just two years ago.\nThe commission is supposed to factor in all of the feedback it received when writing its final draft, so if you do have strong feelings on the matter, it\u2019s worth leaving a comment.\nAnd clearly, this proceeding has struck a chord. There are currently almost 22 million filings on the proposal, setting a dramatic new record at the FCC. The last net neutrality proceeding set the prior FCC comment record at what at the time seemed like a whopping 3.7 million responses.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo leave a comment, you\u2019ll have to go to this site, click \u201c+ Express,\u201d and then fill out the form it opens up to. Make sure you leave the proceeding number \u201c17-108\u201d in place, as that\u2019s what ties it to the net neutrality proposal. Also, be aware that everything filed is public, so others will be able to see your name and address.\nDespite the overwhelming number of comments, FCC leadership has made it clear that they won\u2019t be swayed by sheer quantity of support on one side or the other. Over the past several months, commission chairman Ajit Pai has consistently said that what matters is the quality, not the quantity of the comments, saying that a well-argued legal brief is more valuable than, potentially, millions of people demanding basic protections.\nIt\u2019s pretty clear this argument is being made so that the commission can eventually ignore millions and millions of comments from net neutrality supporters and go ahead with its plan to reverse Title II. But ultimately, more comments against the plan still makes matters harder, as the commission will very likely have to defend its changes in court.\nCorrection August 28th, 12:04PM ET: This article initially misstated the proceeding number as 17-801 instead of 17-108.\n"}
