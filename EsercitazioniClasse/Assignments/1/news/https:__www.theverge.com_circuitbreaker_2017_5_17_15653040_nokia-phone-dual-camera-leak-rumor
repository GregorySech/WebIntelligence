As Evan Blass from VentureBeat points out, the 30-second clip depicts the Nokia 3 and 5 with two other unrecognizable devices. One of them even features a dual-camera setup. Although the video has since been taken down, Blass tweeted a copy:\n\n\nThis will surely get pulled at some point, so I'll mirror it here [source: https://t.co/37yp63CAeC] pic.twitter.com/GktpXnt4pS\u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) May 16, 2017\n\n\n\nThe two devices on the left (pictured in the photo above), are the unidentified phones. Blass points out that the dual-camera device might be the Nokia 9, which is expected to be a new flagship device. With the video being pulled, we can only assume HMD Global, the Finnish company that licensed the rights to produce Nokia phones, didn\u2019t want us to see this footage just yet, but the fact that it exists in the first place means these phones might not be too far off.\n"}
