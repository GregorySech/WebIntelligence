{"title": "The Comic-Con trailer for Seth MacFarlane\u2019s The Orville promises plenty of interstellar gags", "content": " \nAt San Diego Comic-Con today, Fox Television released a new trailer for its upcoming space comedy from Seth MacFarlane, The Orville. It shows off plenty of interstellar gags, and comes with a release date: September 10th. \nThis new trailer doesn\u2019t show off much more than the trailer released back in May: MacFarlane stars as the hapless Captain Ed Mercer, who is assigned to command the U.S.S. Orville. MacFarlane is best known for creating Fox\u2019s Family Guy, and the show looks as though it\u2019s aiming for the same level of humor. Hijinks ensue as crew members calm their nerves by drinking while flying, bemoan long working hours, and engage alien enemies. \nThe Orville premieres on September 10th on Fox. \n"}
