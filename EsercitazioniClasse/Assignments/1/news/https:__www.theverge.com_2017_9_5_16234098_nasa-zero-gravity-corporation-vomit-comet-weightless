{"title": "What it feels like to float in zero gravity", "content": " \nIf you truly want to know what microgravity feels like, you can take a ride on a plane nicknamed the \u201cVomit Comet.\u201d Passengers on these parabolic flights experience periodic moments of weightlessness \u2014 between 20 to 30 seconds at a time \u2014 simulating what it feels like to float around the International Space Station.\nIn the season finale of Space Craft, we booked a flight with the Zero Gravity Corporation, one of a handful of organizations in the world that currently offers parabolic flight experiences. Its main asset is a hollowed-out Boeing 727 that has been modified to better accommodate the unique flight trajectory needed for zero gravity flight.\nThe way the flight works is fairly simple: the plane flies in a series of parabolas, or peaks and valleys. Initially, the aircraft pulls up and increases thrust at a 45-degree angle. During this portion of the flight, passengers actually feel extra gravity \u2014 around 1.8 Gs. Then, the plane reduces thrust and lowers its nose, just before reaching the top of the peak. It\u2019s at this moment that the plane, and everyone inside, shift into free fall. So in reality, you\u2019re not floating so much as falling, like a skydiver surrounded by a plane. After half a minute, the plane then starts to pull up again and the process is repeated.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA has long used parabolic flights to help train astronauts for trips to space. The planes are also helpful for researchers that want to better understand how new technologies might behave in a weightless environment. For instance, scientists working on a new gripping robot to remove space trash were able to test out their prototype on a parabolic flight, finding that it worked just as well \u2014 if not better \u2014 in zero gravity.\nBut apart from being used for research, parabolic flight is also a great way for people not involved in aerospace to experience what it feels like to be outside the bonds of Earth\u2019s gravity \u2014 albeit briefly. It was an experience I\u2019ll certainly never forget, and as you\u2019ll see in the video above, I made my delight known. \n\n \n"}
