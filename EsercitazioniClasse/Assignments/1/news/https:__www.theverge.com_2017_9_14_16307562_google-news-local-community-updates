{"title": "Google News now displays localized community updates from bloggers", "content": " \nGoogle announced today that it\u2019s going to start including hyperlocal events in Google News. Pulling from sources like bloggers and high school newspapers, the new feature, called Community Updates, will keep you in the loop on \u201cnews and events happening right in your own backyard,\u201d according to Google.\nGoogle has been tweaking its News feature a lot in the past year. In June, Google News got a redesign that reduced clutter and added the Local tab. \nNow underneath that Local tab, Community Updates will get down to even smaller, more local details based on your location. It will include fare such as an outdoor donut and craft beer pairing event in Rochester, New York, or a list of open restaurants and grocery stores in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Community updates are currently only available in the US in English.\n\n"}
