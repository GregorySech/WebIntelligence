{"title": "iPhone graphics supplier to sell off businesses amid patent battle with Apple", "content": " \nImagination Technologies, the company that\u2019s long supplied graphics chip designs for the iPhone, has announced plans to sell off two of its businesses amid a major patent dispute with Apple.\nLast month, Imagination\u2019s business was crushed after Apple announced it would begin making its own graphics solutions and end its reliance on the company within two years. Its stock price dipped by more than half within a single day and has only lowered since.\nImagination is starting a formal dispute over licensing fees\nTo stabilize itself, Imagination is doing two things: first, it\u2019s announcing plans to sell off two businesses \u2014 one focused on embedded processors, another on licensing patents related to mobile and IoT. And second, Imagination is beginning a formal \u201cdispute resolution procedure\u201d with Apple, in hopes of getting Apple to license some of its graphics patents.\nImagination believes that Apple can\u2019t possibly build its own graphics chips without infringing on some of its patents. But Apple has contended otherwise, so Imagination is now turning to a dispute process set up under the two companies\u2019 existing licensing agreement.\n\u201cApple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination\u2019s technology, without violating Imagination\u2019s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information,\u201d the company wrote last month.\nImagination now says that it has \u201cbeen unable to make satisfactory progress\u201d on a new licensing arrangement, which is why it\u2019s decided to turn to the formal dispute process. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe outcome of this dispute is pretty critical for Imagination. The company\u2019s business essential revolves around the iPhone, which brings in huge royalty payments. The \u201cPowerVR\u201d unit that Apple licensed graphics technology from was responsible for more than 60 percent of Imagination\u2019s revenue in its last fully reported year. So it\u2019s clear why Imagination is aggressively pursing a way to keep any amount of Apple\u2019s payments coming.\n"}
