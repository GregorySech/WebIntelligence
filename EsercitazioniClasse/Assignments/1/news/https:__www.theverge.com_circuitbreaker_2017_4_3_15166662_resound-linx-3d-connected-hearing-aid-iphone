{"title": "These iPhone-connected hearing aids let doctors make adjustments remotely", "content": " \nConnected hearing aids are nothing new, but today a company called ReSound introduced the iPhone-compatible LiNX 3D, which can be adjusted remotely. This means doctors can access their patients\u2019 hearing aids and make minor adjustments without the person having to revisit their office. The hearing aids also pair with an app for iOS, watchOS, and Android. Through the app, patients can talk to their doctors or learn more about the hearing aid they\u2019re wearing.\nSimilarly to its predecessor, the LiNX 2, the LiNX 3D prioritizes voices over ambient sounds in a noisy environment. The 3D will be released later this year with pricing also to be announced.\n"}
