{"content": " \nApple\u2019s chief design officer Jony Ive is something of a legend in Silicon Valley. He\u2019s the man whose golden touch is credited with the iconic designs of some of Apple\u2019s most successful products, like the iPhone, iPod, and iMac. \nBut while Ive is very good at designing cutting-edge technology, it seems that he cannot do the same for a magazine cover. I mean this in the literal sense: when presented the opportunity to design a \u201climited edition\u201d cover for Wallpaper magazine, Ive seems to have drawn a blank.\nIve seems to have drawn a blank\nThe magazine cover is meant to coincide with an extensive interview Wallpaper \u2014 which covers architecture, design, and art \u2014 conducted with Ive on the subject of the new Apple Park building and the iPhone X. But you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that from the cover. With the exception of a converting Wallpaper\u2019s ordinarily black logo to a retro Apple-inspired rainbow, there\u2019s no way of actually knowing that this interview is inside.\nThere are a few bits of information in the interview, including Ive\u2019s commitment that Apple will continue to update the X over time. As Ive puts it: \u201cIn 12 months\u2019 time, this object will be able to do things that it can\u2019t now.\u201d (So, it'll get a software update with some new features.)\nThe cover is so baffling that I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around it. Steve Jobs famously said, \u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d In the case of Ive\u2019s magazine cover \u2014 an object that is supposed to perform the very basic task of informing you what it contains to read \u2014 the only conclusion I can draw based on Ive\u2019s design is that his ideal magazine is one with no content at all. \nOr maybe I just don\u2019t get it. As Ive himself once said in a prior interview: \"Simplicity is not the absence of clutter, that's a consequence of simplicity... The absence of clutter is just a clutter-free product. That's not simple.\u201d\nSure.\n\n", "title": "Jony Ive's perfect magazine is one with no content"}
