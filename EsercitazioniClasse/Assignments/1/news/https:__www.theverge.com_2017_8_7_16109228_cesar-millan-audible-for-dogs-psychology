{"title": "Cesar Millan and Audible think audiobooks can help your dog stay calm while you\u2019re gone", "content": " \nAudible and Cesar Millan have teamed up to make a free guide to playing audiobooks for your dog. Millan, who has made a famous career of advising people on how to train and care for their dogs, has now turned to using audiobooks as a means of maintaining calm in dogs who are home alone waiting for their owners to return. Some dogs who are home alone tend to experience separation issues and have trouble staying relaxed.\nThe free guide is called Audible for Dogs. Millan also made a curated rotating selection of audiobook titles available with personalized introductions from himself about their canine appeal. Millan picked out assorted titles from Trevor Noah\u2019s Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood to Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice to Soldier Dogs: The Untold Story of America\u2019s Canine Heroes by Maria Goodavage. \nAccording to Millan\u2019s research at his Dog Psychology Center in Los Angeles, audiobooks were found to potentially help dogs cope with stress, depression, and boredom at home. Out of 100 dog volunteers, 76 percent of dogs behaved in a more calm and relaxed manner after listening to the audiobooks over a four-week period, according the press release. The audiobooks were found to be more effective than music. \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave some kind of sound behind, when your dog is alone, make sure it\u2019s something that keeps them calm,\u201d says Millan in a behind-the-scenes video. \u201cThe sound of the audiobook is going to take the dog into a very resting state.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be like having a friend that I\u2019m leaving him with, rather than just leaving him by himself,\u201d says Leslie in a case study video. The press release teases that, in the guide, you\u2019ll learn how sound volume tends to affect dogs and how dogs prefer narrators that are of the same gender as their primary owner.\n\n\n"}
