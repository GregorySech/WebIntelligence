And we\u2019ve watched as obscure athletic gear got crushed. We even watched as a group of gummy bears got crushed. Truth is, we\u2019ve run out of things to crush, and now it\u2019s nostalgia\u2019s turn. \nMotherboard calls this pressing the \u201cgruesome death\u201d that Furby deserves, and the many YouTube commenters who apparently requested the video seem to agree. \u201cThank you for taking out such a dangerous creature!\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThis was the best video in a while,\u201d wrote another. \nOther commenters seemed to have a little more heart: \u201cthis video is cursed that fucking furby had fear in its eyes. he trusted you\ufeff.\u201d\nAt the end of the same video, a block of Lego gets crushed, which apparently was meant to drive home the idea that your childhood is officially over. \n"}
