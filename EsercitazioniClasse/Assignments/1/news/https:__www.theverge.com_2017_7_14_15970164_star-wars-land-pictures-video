{"title": "Disney offers a first look at Star Wars land", "content": " \nDisney has finally given a first glimpse into its highly anticipated Star Wars lands currently being built in California and Florida, unveiling a 50-foot-wide 3D model of the area that will eventually cover about 14 acres. The Star Wars-themed attractions are due to open in 2019 at Disneyland in Anaheim, and at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios at Disney World in Orlando. \nIn a blog post, the company said both Star Wars-inspired lands will take guests to a never-before-seen planet, a remote trading port, and \u201cone of the last stops before Wild Space.\u201d The unveiling came at the D23 expo, currently being held in Anaheim, California, where the models are on display through the weekend.\n\nThere will be two main attractions: one that lets guests captain the Millennium Falcon on a secret mission, while the other places thrill-seekers in the middle of a \u201cclimatic battle\u201d between the First Order and the Resistance. The images released show rugged terrain, lush forests reminiscent of scenes on Endor in Return of the Jedi, and metal cantina structures. According to Bloomberg, the new Star Wars lands will cost about $1 billion each.\n\n\nThe @DisneyParks #StarWars-themed land model is OUT of this world and you have to see it at #D23Expo pic.twitter.com/87hg206TSI\u2014 Disney D23 (@DisneyD23) July 14, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the most ambitious land we\u2019ve built to date,\u201d said Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney\u2019s parks division at the unveiling. Plans for Star Wars lands were announced two years ago and promised \u201ctotal immersion\u201d that would see guests walk around and interact with random characters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new section also boasts a never-before-seen planet and a remote trading port.\nImage: Disney\n\n\n\u201cAs you move through the areas, you might be recruited to join one side or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you a spy? Are you part of the Resistance or willing to join the First Order? It\u2019s up to you. And your role inside of that will be defined by how you choose,\u201d Scott Mallwitz, \u200eexecutive creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering, told the Orange County Register.\nEarlier this year, Disney also ramped up its expansion, and opened an Avatar-themed land in Orlando based on the movie\u2019s feature planet Pandora.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               A 3D-model of the Star Wars section of its theme park.\n            \n\n              Disney\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Disney\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Disney\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Disney\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
