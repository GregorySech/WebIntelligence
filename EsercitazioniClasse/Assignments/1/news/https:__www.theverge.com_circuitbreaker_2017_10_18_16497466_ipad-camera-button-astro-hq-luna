{"title": "This clever hack turns the iPad\u2019s camera into a button", "content": " \niPad apps don\u2019t have access to a single physical button, so an app developer found a way to hack one on. Astro HQ, the company behind the drawing app Astropad, uses its latest app to turn the iPad\u2019s camera into a button: you tap the camera, and an on-screen panel slides out; tap again, and it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s a really clever idea that allows controls to be taken off the screen, freeing up space.\nOf course, this approach comes with a major downside: the camera has to be on and analyzing the entire time. That poses some potential battery issues, not to mention privacy concerns. Astro says it\u2019s addressed both. It claims to blur camera imagery \u201cto the point of not being able to see any data coming in,\u201d so that it\u2019s only looking at whether the camera turns dark. As for battery life, Astro says the camera button uses less than 1 percent of the iPad\u2019s CPU at any given time, so it theoretically won\u2019t make a huge dent beyond the app itself. The feature will also be optional.\n\u201cNo one has used the camera like we are doing.\u201d\nThe camera button will be part of Luna, a new app Astro is making that turns the iPad into a wireless Mac display (with the help of a tiny dongle). Because Astro doesn\u2019t want to take up any of the screen with controls and toolbars, it decided to make a pop-out menu that hides controls away when you aren\u2019t using them. In its previous app, Astropad, Astro used a floating button that you can move around the screen to someplace out of the way. But it was never truly out of the way or truly convenient, leading Astro to search for a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIF: Astro HQ\n\n\nThat better option ended up being the camera button. Astro is still trying to figure out what it\u2019ll offer as a backup for those who opt out of using the camera option \u2014 it had planned to use the iPad\u2019s volume buttons, but realized Apple doesn\u2019t allow that \u2014 so it\u2019s possible something like the floating button will still stick around. There\u2019s also the question of whether Apple will allow this novel use of the camera. Matt Ronge, CEO of Astro, says he thinks it should be in the clear.\n\u201cWe looked through the App Review guidelines, and we don\u2019t see a reason why the Camera Button wouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d Ronge writes in an email to The Verge. Ultimately it\u2019s still Apple\u2019s choice, he says, but \u201cother apps have done similar things with the proximity sensor on the iPhone in the past (iPad doesn\u2019t have one), so there is precedent there. However no one has used the camera like we are doing.\u201d\nLuna is supposed to come out in May. Astro is currently raising funds for the app on Kickstarter as part of a campaign that closes tomorrow. It\u2019s already at 20 times its funding goal.\n"}
