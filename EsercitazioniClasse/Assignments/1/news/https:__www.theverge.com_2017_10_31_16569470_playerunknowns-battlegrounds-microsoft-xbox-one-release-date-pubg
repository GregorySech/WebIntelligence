{"content": " \nMicrosoft became the official publisher of the popular survival shooter PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (PUBG) earlier this year. While the promise has always been a 2017 release on the Xbox, Microsoft is revealing today that PUBG will be available on December 12th, through the Xbox Game Preview program. That does mean this, like the PC version, won\u2019t be a final edition of the game, but in an industry where a lot of games arrive before they\u2019re really finished it shouldn\u2019t matter.\nPUBG is a competitive shooter where 100 people parachute into a map and loot cities and towns for weapons, armor, and other in-game items. It\u2019s then a fight to the finish, Hunger Games-style, while the map shrinks around players forcing them into battles. The game has been available on Steam in beta since March, and has sold more than 8 million copies. PUBG also overtook Dota to become the most played game in August, with more than 800,000 players at the same time. Last month, PUBG also hit a million consecutive players.\nThere\u2019s still no news on a PlayStation 4 release, despite Microsoft using this week\u2019s Paris Games Week event, which is typically dominated by Sony, as an opportunity to time its news. Alongside the Xbox news, version 1.0 of PUBG for the PC will be available in late December. That does mean that PUBG for Xbox and PC will have separate roadmaps, despite being developed at the same time. \u201cVarious Xbox One features and functionality will change and come online over time just like they have on PC, with our goal being to have both versions align to each other as soon as possible,\u201d says Chang Han Kim, CEO of PUBG Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is also releasing three limited-edition cosmetic packs for PUBG that will be exclusive to Xbox. While there\u2019s no pricing or exact timing available for them yet, they\u2019ll only be available for a limited time as \u201cthere are no plans to feature any in-game purchases in the Xbox Game Preview version\u201d of PUBG.\nWhile PUBG developer Bluehole is gearing up to the Xbox One release, the company isn\u2019t happy about its competition.  Bluehole says it has \u201cgrowing concerns\u201d about the similarities between Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite title. Fortnite debuted back in July as a sandbox survival game, but quickly introduced a new battle royale mode as PUBG got popular. Epic has been referencing PUBG \u201cin the promotion of Fortnite to their community and in communications with the press,\u201d says Bluehole.\n\n", "title": "PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds is coming to Xbox One on December 12th"}
