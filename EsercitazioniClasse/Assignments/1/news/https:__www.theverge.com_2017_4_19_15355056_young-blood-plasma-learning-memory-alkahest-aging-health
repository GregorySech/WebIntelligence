{"title": "Young human blood may help old mice learn better", "content": " \nThe promise of young-blood injections to keep us sharp has captivated Silicon Valley, but the studies have all been with mice blood \u2014 until now. Researchers at Stanford University found that injecting mice with a protein found in human umbilical cord blood can improve their memory, though not everyone is as positive about the results.  \nTwo years ago, the Stanford University lab of Tony Wyss-Coray, senior author of today\u2019s study, showed that injecting young blood into old mice helped them perform better on memory tests. The team has moved on to injecting human blood of various ages, and the results are published in the journal Nature. After finding that old mice injected with umbilical cord blood performed better on tests, the scientists isolated a protein called TIMP2 in the blood that they thought was responsible for these effects \u2014 and then injected the protein by itself into more old mice and found the same positive results. It\u2019s unclear how much this result would hold up in humans, but the team hopes this will be helpful for both academics and people working in the pharmaceutical industry, says study co-author Joseph Castellano, who researches neurology at Stanford. \nThe mice who saw positive effects from plasma were very sick\nBut before you rush to the maternity ward of the local hospital, keep in mind that there are limits to the paper, says Irina Conboy, a bioengineer at UC Berkeley who has also studied young blood rejuvenation and published a less hopeful paper in Nature Communications last November. (Her paper showed that old blood makes mice old more quickly than young blood can rejuvenate.) The researchers suggest that our memory degenerates because we lose the TIMP2 protein as we age, and that\u2019s why TIMP2-rich young blood could help us. But Conboy points out that previous papers show that there are high levels of TIMP2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of human patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, a disease where your memory gets worse. \u201cI am sure there is not just one silver bullet, and attracting attention to this idea that you can use human plasma injections is, I think, counterproductive,\u201d she adds. \u201cFurthermore, when you\u2019re supported by a company that makes fresh-frozen human plasma, there is a very high temptation to say this is a miracle drug.\u201d (The Stanford group is affiliated with Wyss-Coray\u2019s company, Alkahest, which is studying the effects of young human plasma in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.)\nIn the first step of today\u2019s study, the researchers injected human plasma of different ages (umbilical cord, 19 to 24, or 61 to 82) into mice whose immune systems were destroyed so their bodies wouldn\u2019t reject it. Mice who got the cord plasma did better on learning and memory tests, like escaping a maze. Mice who got the young adult plasma improved a little, and plasma from old people didn\u2019t do much. \nNext, the scientists used a device called a protein micro-array to analyze the amounts of different proteins in the blood. \u201cWe wanted to see what proteins were changing at various stages during human plasma aging,\u201d says Castellano. \u201cWe wanted to see, what\u2019s elevated in cord plasma that\u2019s also changing in mouse plasma aging.\u201d Using the arrays, they decided that the key protein was TIMP2, which regulates the activity of other proteins. There\u2019s a lot of it in cord blood but not so much in older blood. \nNext, they injected a lot of TIMP2 by itself into these old mice with a functioning immune system. The injections caused similar effects, according to Castellano, with these mice performing better on memory tests\nBut Conboy is more skeptical. First, the mice with destroyed immune systems are so sick to begin with that the good results might not be very representative. \u201cWhen you say that something has been \u2018rejuvenated,\u2019 it has to be old to begin with, and more physiologically similar to people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the animals that they used are really very, very sick.\u201d The immunosuppressed mice were about 12 to 14 months old, which is roughly analogous to the 40s or 50s in humans. It\u2019s possible the memory \u201crejuvenation\u201d was happening only because the mice were already sick, according to Conboy. She adds that at that age the results aren\u2019t that impressive, since 50-year-olds don\u2019t suffer severe memory loss and exercise and diet are usually enough to keep the brain healthy. \nPlus, it\u2019s not entirely certain that the results really suggest cord plasma could cause the same good results on normal old mice instead of ones with destroyed immune systems. The distinction between the enriched TIMP2 protein and plasma itself is key, given the number of companies that are focusing specifically on young plasma.\nIn the second part of the experiment, the researchers injected a lot of the purified TIMP2 protein into normal old mice. They labeled the TIMP2 protein and found that it does make its way to the brain. The problem is, they didn\u2019t label the proteins in cord blood to see if TIMP2 was the key protein, according to Conboy. It\u2019s a big protein, so it\u2019s possible that TIMP2 is present in the cord blood but there\u2019s not enough of it in plasma to cause big effects on normal old mice. Or, maybe TIMP2 from cord blood doesn\u2019t make it to the brain, or maybe a different protein is the right one. \nCastellano notes that it\u2019s easy to label a single protein but much more challenging to label all of them in the blood and thus it\u2019s impractical. In addition, when the researchers gave old mice plasma that didn\u2019t have TIMP2, they didn\u2019t see the same benefits, suggesting that TIMP2 really could be the protein creating these positive effects. Still, he emphasized that this is a pre-clinical trial and there\u2019s still a lot to study. Next, the team wants to study the effects of TIMP2 in the brain more thoroughly, and also see how the protein affects mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n"}
