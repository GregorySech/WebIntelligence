{"title": "Logan broke our hearts in many beautiful ways \u2014 and one awful one", "content": " \nSpoiler warning: This conversation digs into some of Logan\u2019s major plot reveals, including the ending. Especially the ending. Hoo boy, the ending.\nThis past weekend saw the release of the first R-rated Wolverine movie, Logan, the bloodiest, saddest, weariest X-Men movie ever made. Many critics are also saying it\u2019s the best. Hugh Jackman claims this is his final outing playing the superhero on-screen, and given how the movie ends, it\u2019s easy to see why. But there are so many strikingly bleak moments before that ending arrives. This is nominally a superhero movie, in that the characters are from superhero comics and films. But it plays more like a cynical tragedy, a drama about regret, personal failings, and death. Director James Mangold and his co-writers focus on the characters\u2019 emotions, particularly their anger at the way the world turned out, at each other, and at themselves. And in the process, they find so many tragic, telling moments. Here, three Verge staffers talk about the parts of Logan that wrecked them emotionally.\nTasha: I have never been the biggest Wolverine fan, but I still walked out of this movie absolutely devastated, and impressed with the movie for bringing up those emotions so powerfully. What hit you hardest about Logan? What stuck with you longest when you left the theater?\n\nKwame: I\u2019m going for the full spoilers here. What struck me most was the fall and brutal death of Charles Xavier. That feels like a world historical tragedy within the film. Patrick Stewart has always brought such gravitas to the character. He\u2019s the spiritual and philosophical leader for this group of people committed to protecting humanity even when they\u2019re hated. He was never painted as infallible in the comics, but he had something of that quality in the films. So to see this great man brought low not by fighting Onslaught or the Phoenix Force, but by old age and mental illness, is a gut-punch as soon as you see him on-screen. He\u2019s still an omega-level mutant who can kill people with his thoughts, but he has no control over his powers because he\u2019s old. He\u2019s not a god. He\u2019s a frail old man who needs help going to the bathroom. And then to see him die so full of regret \u2014 I wanted to fall out of my chair seeing that.\nCharles Xavier isn\u2019t a god, he\u2019s a frail old man\nMegan: This is really superficial, but obviously relevant to Logan: old men make me incredibly sad. I think a lot of it has to do with my own Old Dad. He\u2019s in his 70s now. Fortunately, he\u2019s in very good health. But I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life away from home, and every time I go back, I can\u2019t help but notice how he\u2019s visibly aged; how he moves a little slower, breathes a little heavier. \nWatching Logan felt like that. I\u2019ve grown up watching Charles Xavier and Wolverine saving the day as powerful, smart superheroes. Now, returning to them in Logan, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve passed some invisible line. Charles is so fragile, a victim to the same powers that used to make him one of the world\u2019s most powerful mutants. That, on top of seeing how Logan has weakened over time, drove me straight into bummer town. \nTasha: I think that also explains why it\u2019s such a bittersweet thrill when Logan doses himself up with serum and becomes his familiar feral self for about 60 seconds. There\u2019s such an emotional rush there, as he gets his old self back, and then such a sharp fall when the serum-rush fades. It\u2019s like we have to watch him age all over again, this time in fast time.\nBut getting back to Charles: one of the many, many Most Painful Things about Logan for me is the way he seems close to dementia in his obsession over Laura, the first new young mutant, so far as he knows, born in the last 25 years. He keeps repeating her name over and over to Logan, who has no interest in her. In the limo, when Logan\u2019s trying to escape the Reavers and Charles just keeps saying \u201cBut Laura, don\u2019t forget Laura, we can\u2019t leave Laura,\u201d he\u2019s like a little kid who keeps yelling \u201cMom, Mom\u201d while she\u2019s on the phone because he doesn\u2019t understand she\u2019s ignoring him, he thinks she just hasn\u2019t heard him. The performance there doesn\u2019t feel like Charles sees Laura as a person, as an actual child they\u2019re abandoning. He\u2019s not panicked, just puzzled. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an idea he\u2019s fixated on. The movie is careful to not overexplain why, and I think that\u2019s a brilliant choice, but it\u2019s also a relatively subtle note in the middle of a big fight scene. Did that strike you the way it struck me?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n\nKwame: I definitely got the sense that he was desperate to save Laura not because they were all in immediate danger, but because she validated him. They\u2019re running for their lives, but that seems almost lost on him, because he\u2019s so fixated on her. And we only get hints of that in the dialogue and in the performances, but we do know that the X-Men, along with most of the world\u2019s mutants, are gone. It feels like he\u2019s trying to grasp onto his glory days as the great Professor X, as if he\u2019s only himself when he has a young charge to nurture. And he really is warm and nurturing when Laura comes along, way more than he is when it\u2019s just him, Logan, and Caliban. But read that way, he\u2019s being completely self-serving and sad. He knows he\u2019s a shell of himself.\nAlso: Charles totally killed the X-Men.\nTasha: Did he? I know it\u2019s implied, with the news report about the fatal \u201caccident in Westchester,\u201d which is the canon location of the X-Mansion. And it would explain so much about why Logan feels responsible for him, and seems to hate him at the same time, which is one of the most touching and frustrating things about the movie. But I keep having mechanical issues with that idea. \u201cThe X-Men\u201d is a big, diffuse group that changes often. They all happened to be in the area? And he killed them all? What about all the other non-X-Men mutants? Was he plugged into Cerebro at the time? Logan\u2019s script originally laid it all out, but Mangold decided the vague implications made a better story. That decision deliberately leaves a million questions. And it feels like something we might eventually get a featurette or comic or some other tie-in about, but I do feel like it\u2019s much better as an unexplained, implied bit of storyline.\nMegan: Skipping those flashbacks didn\u2019t bother me much, because I feel like we\u2019ve already watched the X-Men all die in films at one point or another. Is that sociopathic? I\u2019m like, \u201cY\u2019all been dead to me since The Last Stand.\u201d \nWhat does get to me is the way that confession is set up. Charles is sweetly tucked into bed, reflecting on how he\u2019s just had one of his best days in years, when you see him start to emotionally cave. He remembers what he did. He knows that he\u2019s murdered the very students he\u2019s meant to protect, and he knows he doesn\u2019t deserve peace for it. And then there\u2019s no hope for redemption, no moment of reconciliation over the anger Logan clearly has, because Fake Logan murders Charles seconds later. Charles dying, believing Logan blamed him \u2014 and subsequently punished him \u2014 for an unspeakable accident is the real gut punch for me. \nthere\u2019s no hope for redemption, no moment of reconciliation\nKwame: And think about what\u2019s implied by mutants being gone. Even if we\u2019re open to the idea that there are more in hiding \u2014 people who are just really good at hiding their powers \u2014 we\u2019re forced to think about what the film doesn\u2019t address, which takes us into horror territory. The X-Men have always faced persecution, but what does decades of persecution and potential genocide look like? Pierce tells us Caliban was a mutant-tracker at one point. Does that mean Transigen and who knows what other companies were hunting down mutants for 30 years before the start of the movie? The movie sure as hell suggests that happened, and it\u2019s terrifying.\nTasha: So Logan considers the emotional fallout of big events much more important and relevant than actually presenting those events. There\u2019s plenty of action, but even the action is more about feeling than anything else. For me, at least, that emotional focus was refreshing and daring, and an antidote to recent superhero blockbusters that have narrowed allowable emotions for heroes and villains alike down to \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cangry.\u201d For me, that\u2019s what makes Logan feel so different as a film. It dives so deeply into the characters\u2019 despair and mutual dependence and grief that it makes heartbreaking moments like Logan\u2019s \u201cOh, that\u2019s what fatherly pride feels like\u201d at the end of the movie feel natural and beautiful, instead of cheaply manipulative. But how did you guys feel about it? Does the lack of detail concern you? Did the personal focus work for you?\nMegan: I\u2019m so burned out on grand-scheme superhero movies that I really appreciate the smaller lens. We\u2019ve seen the X-Men save the world multiple times already; it\u2019s nice to think that for once, it can take care of itself. Logan telling a more personal story makes it far more interesting to me, because even given all the mutants and evil clones, it still feels relatable. If you\u2019ve kept up with this franchise, you have a relationship with these characters. It\u2019s part of what makes this story so compelling. It would be sad to see these events play out on their own, but because this is Professor X and Wolverine, it becomes even more powerful. These are our heroes, and they\u2019re falling apart in front of our eyes. \nIt\u2019s kind of like that sweet family that Logan, Laura, and Charles stay with. What happens to them is a tragedy, but they\u2019re also strangers to us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n\nTasha: Oh god, that poor kind farm family. I don\u2019t care that they\u2019re strangers \u2014 no one thing in this movie was as emotionally traumatic to me as the moment when the Munsons invite Logan and company home. From that moment, I knew the Munsons were doomed, and the next half-hour of the movie was just waiting to see how painful and terrible their deaths would be. The fact that there\u2019s no upside for them, no real chance of survival, and they basically all die for being nice people is one of the few things that makes Logan feel like a knife-twisting exercise in cynicism and nihilism for me. You can argue that Logan and Charles earned their deaths in karma a long time ago, with the people they\u2019ve killed and the suffering they\u2019ve caused. Or you could argue that they chose their deaths by choosing to be heroes, because heroes rarely go quietly in their beds of old age. But why bring civilians into it, and why give them so little chance to survive?\nOne of the most poignant single moments in this movie for me is when Will Munson pulls the shotgun trigger on Logan. The gun is empty and nothing happens, but it\u2019s clear in that moment that Will sees absolutely no difference between Logan and the monster who just murdered Will\u2019s family. And the audience can certainly understand why.\nMegan: The Munsons\u2019 death just smelled manufactured to me. They\u2019re there to serve as collateral damage \u2014 we all knew what would happen to them the second they came on-screen. That\u2019s probably one of the few times where I felt the movie was trying to emotionally manipulate the audience, rather than really earn a reaction. \nThe Munsons as collateral damage is where the film goes too far\nKwame: I\u2019m still wrestling with that scene, to be perfectly honest. The film already goes out of its way to demonstrate that the world is ugly and cruel and that people die senselessly all the time. The fact that we go into the scene with no illusions about the fate of the Munsons actually ratcheted up the suspense for me, since I was sitting there thinking, \u201cMaybe something good will happen! Maybe it\u2019ll be okay!\u201d Except that nothing is ever okay. I felt defeated when Will Munson crumpled on the spot after failing to shoot Logan. Maybe that was the point. Maybe everything about Logan\u2019s world and what he brought to it needed to be wiped away before Laura could take up his mantle. I just can\u2019t tell if the movie went too far in painting a world that\u2019s so unrelentingly bleak as to destroy a family to prove a point about itself. Maybe if someone survived I\u2019d have felt better.\nTasha: It certainly was an effective way of building tension, but yes, they seem like cannon fodder, and for me, it\u2019s the bridge too far for this movie.\nBut as Megan pointed out, we know the other characters so well, and we\u2019re presumably somewhat invested in them, and this movie just flat-out tortures them. Logan\u2019s in pain all the time, his healing factor is failing, he\u2019s in the process of dying. Charles is old and feeble and ineffectual. Caliban gets tortured by the bad guys and commits suicide. So it\u2019s strange to me that I felt more emotional about the newbies to the story.\nBut part of that is that my investment in the lead characters doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I want to protect them from harm. For me, the traumas they go through in Logan are about using these familiar figures in a different kind of story than we\u2019ve seen on film so far for the X-Men \u2014 or most other long-history superheroes, for that matter. This story is about the end of stories, and usually in comics, that\u2019s just a gimmick before a reboot. Here, it feels both final and inevitable, which for me justified whatever the filmmakers put the canon characters through. Was anything besides the Munson family too much for you in terms of the suffering and indignity and misery on-screen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n\nMegan: There\u2019s a point in the film where Logan and Laura are talking about taking lives. She tells him she\u2019s killed bad people, and he replies that she\u2019ll have to live with it all the same. This is a violent movie, full of gore and death. Our hero is a murderer \u2014 at his best, he is a fierce, animalistic force of strength and metal. He\u2019s always been that way. However much I may love Logan as a character, it\u2019s hard to dispute that he has taken more lives than fans can count. \nSo as much as I appreciate him as a flawed, even broken, hero, I also think his suffering is earned. To throw some Shakespeare by way of Westworld up in here, these violent delights have violent ends. I don\u2019t think Logan ever had any other path. But did Logan and Charles get what they deserve? Do their acts of cruelty, accidental or intentional, erase the good they did?\nas brutal and cynical as the movie is, it ultimately has hope\nKwame: I think the movie, as brutal and cynical as it is, is ultimately hopeful in that respect, because it assumes that what the X-Men, Logan, and Charles accomplished was ultimately good. Even if they\u2019re all in ruins, did terrible things, and the world is on the brink of collapse, the legacy they leave behind is worthwhile. You see that in the comics Laura keeps, which literally serve to lead her to salvation. Even if, as Logan says, \u201cin the real world, people die,\u201d the legend is sustaining.\nIt\u2019s never been clearer that Wolverine is a murder machine. He\u2019s \u201cthe best at what he does, and what he does isn\u2019t very nice.\u201d But he\u2019s still a hero. He still defends Charles and Laura, even when it defies good judgement. He still defends Will Munson from those awful corporate cowboys. And he dies protecting his successor from a monstrous version of himself. As ugly as Logan\u2019s world is, there\u2019s still good in it. That\u2019s exactly why that final shot over his grave when Laura turns the cross into an X lands for us, emotionally. It\u2019s the best way to honor the past, and what it gave Laura \u2014 and us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n\nTasha: It\u2019s also the best way to suggest a future where there are still X-Men, even if they aren\u2019t called that. Without underlining it too pointedly, Logan gives us a group of kids with familiar mutant powers, because they\u2019ve presumably been created from the DNA of familiar mutants \u2014 a new Iceman, a new Magneto, a new Wolverine, and so forth. And it suggest that they\u2019re the future not just of mutant-kind, but of the X-stories in general. There\u2019s a solemn, sweet, tragic continuity there, in that even if the originals are gone, their powers live on in new bodies. There are so many heartbreak moments in Logan that we haven\u2019t touched on: Charles trying to convince Logan that it isn\u2019t too late to be normal and have a family, when we all know it\u2019s much too late. Logan literally trying to hold the life inside Charles\u2019 broken body while saying \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d That awkward, undignified toilet scene, with both men furious and embarrassed about what they\u2019ve come to. But the film still ends on that barest note of hope, and focus on the future, and in the process, it tries to say \u201cAll that is in the past. Things might still get better for the new generation. Maybe this time they\u2019ll do better, and be received better in return.\u201d We can only hope.\n"}
