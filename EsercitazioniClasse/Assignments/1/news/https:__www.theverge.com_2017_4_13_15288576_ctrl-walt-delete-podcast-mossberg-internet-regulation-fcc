{"title": "Can Walt Mossberg save the internet?", "content": " \nWalt\u2019s column this week proposes a plan to change how the internet is managed, regulated, and operated. He suggests that the US government should preserve the internet in a similar fashion to how natural resources are protected. This week on Ctrl-Walt-Delete, Nilay and Walt discuss what we need to change, and possible solutions for the problems politicians and major corporations are debatably only blocking. \n\nWe love your feedback on the topics of the show and suggestions on how to make our podcasts better and more fun for the new year. You can tweet at Walt at @waltmossberg and Nilay at @reckless.
