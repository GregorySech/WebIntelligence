{"content": " The battle of the smart speakers has become a constant back and forth between Amazon and Google. Back in April, Google Home gained the ability to recognize individual voices, which allows the device to personalize its response for everyone in your house or apartment. This way, you\u2019ll get your calendar briefing or curated music playlists when asking Assistant for them, and Google won\u2019t mix up contacts when you call someone with the Home speaker. Today, Amazon announced that Alexa can now do the same thing. You can set up voice recognition using the Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show. Users are asked to read aloud 10 phrases, and Alexa will then use that data to create a voice profile. After that\u2019s done, voice profiles work across other Echo devices and \u201cmost\u201d third-party party Alexa-enabled devices. \u201cOnce you set up the feature, Alexa will learn your voice  versus your spouse/partner/roommate\u2019s voice  and be able to deliver a more personalized experience,\u201d a company spokesperson told The Verge. \u201cToday the feature is available for calling/messaging, flash briefing, shopping, and the Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan, and it\u2019ll be rolling out to additional Alexa features in the future.\u201d Amazon says voice recognition will get \u201csmarter over time\u201d the more it\u2019s used. The company also notes that touch-to-talk devices  i.e. Fire TV remote and the Amazon Tap  do not support voice profiles.", "title": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa can now recognize different voices and give personalized responses"}
