{"content": " There are plenty of unconventional methods to make music, like Shawn Wasabi\u2019s MIDI controller, which is fashioned with 64 arcade buttons, or the cute, squawking Otamatone, which YouTubers have mastered to cover a wide range of beloved tunes. Now, novelty Chinese calculators might be the latest instrument of choice for burgeoning bedroom musicians, particularly the delightful Japanese YouTuber who goes by It\u2019s a Small World. Watch as the mysterious musician absolutely nails the Super Mario theme song on a symphony of four calculators.Though they look like the average calculator that your dad has stashed away in the \u201ceverything\u201d drawer, they\u2019re so much more. The musical calculators used here are the AR-7778 and AR-8001, available on Amazon Japan for about $22, or Chinese retailer Taobao for about $5. They\u2019re made by a Chinese calculator manufacturer called Jia Ling Tong, which makes a few other musical models. Here\u2019s another YouTuber, A Yuu, playing the vocaloid Hatsune Miku\u2019s hit single \u201cSenbonzakura\u201d on the AR-3058.The calculators all use two AAA batteries and are preprogrammed to play around 20 songs. The songs aren\u2019t just short little ditties either; they\u2019re extensively long, playing the entirety of classics like \u201cF\u00fcr Elise.\u201d All the calculators feature different modes. You can set it up to have a woman recite the numbers back to you in Chinese, or you can get to the good stuff and use it as an instrument, with each button corresponding to a musical note. Playing in this mode will leave the screen permanently displaying \u201c2005-01-01,\u201d which I assume is the year it was manufactured. It\u2019s a Small World kindly takes us through a tutorial / behind-the-scenes look at how they practice playing on the calculators. There\u2019s a funny bit at 6:15 when they have to \u201ctune\u201d the calculators; replacing the batteries sometimes changes the timbre of the notes, which is a testament to just how old and wonky these calculators are. Yet, they\u2019re still playable with enough patience and dedication.With two calculators, there\u2019s the classic piano-playing method of having the left hand play the bass lines on one calculator, and the right hand play the melodies on the other. I do not know how the four-calculator setup works, and will assume it\u2019s just some sort of sorcery. I have no trouble believing that It\u2019s a Small World is some sort of superhuman wizard, because they also play hits like \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cShape of You\u201d with perfect musicianship. Further exploration of their channel turns up unexplained oddities like \u201cAll Star but it\u2019s singing water,\u201d which is just 54 seconds of them slapping the water. I\u2019m intrigued, and now also a proud subscriber.And, of course, the calculators also have a silent mode where you can just use the calculator as god intended. But now that you know what\u2019s possible, what\u2019s the fun in that? ", "title": "Calculators are the latest instrument used in creative new ways to make electronic music"}
