{"title": "Fujifilm made a mobile printer for its new square format film", "content": " Fujifilm unveiled a new square version of its Instax film this summer when it released the Instax SQ10 camera, and now it\u2019s bringing that format to its lineup of small wireless printers. Today the company announced the $199 Instax Share SP-3, the third version of the company\u2019s mobile instant film printers since the product was initially released at CES in 2014. The SP-3 is the first to use the new Instax Square film, but it otherwise works much like its predecessor, the SP-2  which prints Instax Mini film . That\u2019s for better and for worse. Better because the SP-2 worked well \u2014 it printed fast  about 10 seconds , was easy to use with all sorts of different phones and services  like Facebook or Instagram , and the print quality was pretty good \u2014 and worse because the app experience is still really rough around the edges.  Grid ViewIn addition to the existing collage option, you can now add text to the prints, but you can\u2019t customize them much beyond color. What you see is pretty much what you get, and many of them frankly look like unfinished ideas. The SP-3 will come in black and white, and goes on sale in \u201cearly November,\u201d according to Fujifilm."}
