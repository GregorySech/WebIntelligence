{"title": "The new Alien: Covenant trailer gives us a good look at the updated xenomorph", "content": " \nThe last Alien: Covenant teaser was a subtle hint at the dangers the movie\u2019s colonists would face on their new world, taking the time to make a reference to the iconic dinner scene in the original Alien. The new trailer, released today, has none of that subtlety \u2014 it seems like it\u2019s basically the whole movie condensed into a two-minute clip. \nThe trailer gives the plot away\nThat means that if you want to go into theaters on May 19th this year and be surprised by Ridley Scott\u2019s next take on the Alien series, you might want to steer clear of this trailer. But for the too-curious among you, the clip will show you a world that seems strangely like our own Earth, albeit with some minor (and deadly) tweaks. The trailer also gives us one of the best looks yet at the Alien (or Aliens?) that will be terrorizing the human colonists, showing them in both facehugger and fully grown form. \nThere are shades of Prometheus in Alien: Covenant\u2019s blue-green shots and sweeping, silent vistas. But there\u2019s also nods to both the original Alien and Aliens, with the colonists trapped both on a ship and in a new colony with a lethal monster. We\u2019ll see which way the new movie goes \u2014 Alien good or Prometheus bad \u2014 in two months. \n"}
