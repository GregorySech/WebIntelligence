{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Story Remix app is Windows Movie Maker on steroids", "content": " \nMicrosoft is introducing a new Windows 10 app today that has been missing since the operating system's launch nearly two years ago: Story Remix. It\u2019s essentially Windows Movie Maker on steroids. If you\u2019re not familiar with Movie Maker, it was an app that let regular Windows consumers create cute little family videos back in the Windows XP and Windows 7 days. Microsoft ditched Movie Maker, but never really created a genuine replacement. Story Remix appears to be a true Movie Maker successor.\nStory Remix works in the cloud by collating images and video you use from any device. That means there will be a Story Remix app for iOS, Android, and Windows so you can grab content from multiple devices and work on your video. It\u2019s similar to Apple\u2019s new Clips app, but a lot more customizable and powerful. If you start a story on an iPhone, you can resume its creation on a Windows 10 PC and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is also combining its work with Remix 3D and Paint 3D into Story Remix, allowing Windows users to import 3D models into movies. You can even pin objects into scenes, much like how Snapchat's new augmented reality lenses work and things like ink will follow people around in videos. Soundtracks can also be added from Microsoft's Groove music service.\nMicrosoft is really aiming this at families and a younger audience who want to quickly create videos with a soundtrack and some neat effects. Microsoft is planning to deliver its impressive Story Remix app with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update later this year.\n"}
