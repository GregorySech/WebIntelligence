{"title": "Jimmy Fallon uses the Force to finally kill the All Star meme", "content": " \nI regret to inform you that Smash Mouth\u2019s song \u201cAll Star\u201d has died \u2014 again. This time, the pop single was murdered in cold, corporate blood by Jimmy Fallon, NBC, and Disney (by way of Star Wars). Above, you can see officially released footage of the brutal act. \nWARNING: it is graphic.\n\u201cAll Star\u201d lived a blessed and full second life as an internet meme thanks to reincarnations like Windows XP \u201cAll Star,\u201d \"All Star\" by Smash Mouth but every word is someBODY, \u201cAll Star\u201d sung backwards, \u201cAll Star\u201d by Smash Mouth but every other word is \"bee\" from Bee Movie and the instrumental is Seinfeld, \u201cAll Star\u201d but the words are ordered by Scrabble score, \u201cPhotograph\u201d by Nickelback but every word is someBODY, \u201cAll Star\u201d but every word is in alphabetical order, \"Bring Me to Life\" but it's performed by Smash Mouth but it's still to the tune of the original song, everything by Jon Sudano, all of these, and many more. It is survived by its relatives Nickelback, The Bee Movie, and Guy Fieri. Memorial services will be held by the Smash Mouth Twitter account. \nMy world's on fire, how about yours?\nWhat all those sweet goofs have, and what Fallon\u2019s lacks, is impurity. One of the reasons these Frankenstein\u2019s monster versions of popular songs are fun in the first place is because of, not in spite of, the moments where the substitute sounds or arrangements don\u2019t quite fit. They have the spice of authenticity. Since we\u2019re all familiar with the melodies and cadence of a song like \u201cAll Star,\u201d there\u2019s an inherent thrill in anticipating or even trying to decode how some beautiful weirdo on the internet managed to fit their version together. You become awed by the work that went into them. \nNBC\u2019s version, in the meantime, stays completely inside the lines. There\u2019s no dissonance, no rough edges. The best \u201cAll Star\u201d memes teeter so precariously on the cliff of intolerability that they become antagonistic. If you said this Star Wars / \u201cAll Star\u201d mash-up is the first fruit from a new NBC Universal algorithm that generates viral-ready videos, I\u2019d believe you; it\u2019s that lifeless. \nI digress. Let\u2019s not forget we\u2019re here today to remember \u201cAll Star.\u201d In its place, may we find a new song to troll our friends and co-workers with. After all, as somebody once told me, we could all use a little change.\n\n"}
