{"title": "Samsung is releasing a new outdoor surveillance cam", "content": " \nUpdate 6/23, 3:03 PM ET: The article as it ran below is incorrect, as was the original image in the post. Hanwha, which makes these cameras under the Samsung brand, clarified that this camera (model number: SNH-V6430BNH) was actually released in December 2016. While it\u2019s not new, Best Buy\u2019s listing of the camera is new. This is the first time the retail store is carrying the device. Best Buy also mislisted the camera with incorrect images, which are what we used in our post. We\u2019ve updated the image and left the article as it first ran below. We regret the error.\n\nSamsung is likely releasing a new outdoor camera soon, judging from a Best Buy page that lists the device. The retail store says a \u201cSmartCam Indoor/Outdoor 1080p Wi-Fi Network Surveillance Camera\u201d is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d It\u2019ll cost $199.99. We\u2019ve reached out to Samsung for confirmation on when it might be released and will update when we hear back. \nThis new camera\u2019s features, at least from what I can tell, are the same as the company\u2019s more expensive, already released outdoor cam. (That camera costs $259.99, so it\u2019s significantly more expensive.) Both versions support night vision and motion detection. They also record Full HD-quality video and connect over Wi-Fi. The key difference between the two appears to be design. The original camera looks like a classic surveillance device with a left to right swivel head. The new camera looks more like a Nest Cam, particularly with its adjustable base.\n\n\nNew indoor/outdoor Samsung cam coming. Taking some design queues from Nest and Logitech? pic.twitter.com/sazNdgynBU\u2014 Dave Zatz (@davezatz) June 21, 2017\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure Samsung will make a more official announcement around this device soon, although the Best Buy page really gives everything away. Still, here are some more images to get you through until the release:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Samsung\n\n\n"}
