{"title": "Astell & Kern's Kann is a true heavyweight portable media player", "content": " \nAstell & Kern\u2019s newest PMP \u2014 the $999 Kann \u2014 is out today, and it looks like a portable media player that makes some impressive modern-day advances. It\u2019s particularly notable given that the high-end portable audio market tends to move very slowly toward the future (when it does at all). \nAstell & Kern is positioning the Kann as an entirely new design that it hopes will stand out from its slate of earlier AK devices as a \u201ccomplete all-around\u201d PMP that will work well for a wider range of users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to know about the Kann, though, is that it\u2019s big: at 25.6mm (just over an inch) it\u2019s over four times as chunky as a modern smartphone like the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7. It also weighs over half a pound (278.7g). \nWhat do you get in exchange for carrying around this brick-sized device? A massive 6000mAh battery (Astell & Kern claims 14 hours of listening time), an integrated powered headphone amp, and both microSD and full-size SD card slots. That\u2019s right: this portable PMP officially has more SD cards slots than Apple\u2019s new MacBook Pro.\nThis PMP has more SD card slots than a MacBook Pro\nOn the more technical side of things, the Kann also has a pair of 3.5mm (unbalanced) and 2.5mm (balanced) jacks for both headphone out and line out, 64GB of internal storage, and it can charge and transfer data over USB-C. And when it comes to audio files, Astell & Kern claims that the Kann can handle playback of up to 32-bit/384kHz for PCM audio, up to DSD256 (11.2mHz) for DSD audio, and supports aptX HD Bluetooth codecs. \nLike any of Astell & Kern\u2019s products, the Kann isn\u2019t exactly cheap at $999 dollars, given that the average smartphone can accomplish the same basic task of \u201cplaying music on the go\u201d in a dramatically cheaper, smaller and more versatile way. For example, the Korean version of the LG G6, is a full-featured smartphone that costs less than the single-purpose Kann, but still offers an integrated quad-DAC for noticeably improved sound quality.\nBut if you truly care about having the best sound, and can live with the huge cost \u2014 and the huge size \u2014 then it might be worth giving the Kann a try. Astell & Kern is also sweetening the deal for early preorders with a free 256GB memory card.\n"}
