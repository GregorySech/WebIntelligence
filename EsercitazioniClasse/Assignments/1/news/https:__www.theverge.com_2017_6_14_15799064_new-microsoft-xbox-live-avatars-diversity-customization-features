{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s new Xbox Live Avatars are impressively diverse and customizable", "content": " \nMicrosoft is preparing to launch a big overhaul of its Xbox Live Avatars system. Originally released as an Xbox 360 feature in 2008, Xbox Live Avatars have been slowly tweaked to include more props and customizability ever since. Microsoft is now introducing a new avatar system that\u2019s designed to make these Xbox avatars a lot more customizable, with a huge focus on diversity.\nThe new avatars will let you fully customize your online character with new body type options, clothing, and props. During the Xbox daily briefing at E3 yesterday, Microsoft demonstrated the new avatar system with a trailer (above) and some behind-the-scenes footage of how the company is building the new Xbox Live Avatars. Microsoft\u2019s trailer shows an amputee, playful costumes, wheelchairs, skateboards, and even motorbikes to demonstrate the wide array of props and customization. There\u2019s even a new pregnancy option, and the ability to control the colors of an avatar with a picker system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe new avatars are built in Unity\n\u201cWe built these from the ground-up, they\u2019re being built in Unity which is a whole new engine,\u201d explains Bryan Saftler, a lead product manager at Xbox. \u201cAvatars are meant for whatever you want your digital self to represent. We don\u2019t want to put you in a box, there are no more checkboxes, no matter what you think you look like or what you want to present online.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s focus on diversity also means that if you want to wear a dress on your avatar you can thanks to gender-neutral clothing and props. \u201cIf you can see it in the store you can wear it, we\u2019re not holding you to any type of checkboxes,\u201d says Kathryn Storm, interaction designer at Xbox.\nIt looks like Microsoft has done a really good job with these new avatars. The software maker is now planning to release what it calls its \u201cAvatar 2.0\u201d system to Windows 10 users first later this year, with the Xbox family of devices to follow.\n"}
