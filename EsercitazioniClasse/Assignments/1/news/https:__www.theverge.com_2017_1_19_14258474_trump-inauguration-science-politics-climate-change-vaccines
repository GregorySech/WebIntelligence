{"title": "Yes, science is political", "content": " \nThis story was originally published on January 19th and has been updated to include video.\nOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve gotten notes from Verge Science readers wondering why news from the incoming Trump administration has seeped into our science coverage. I wasn\u2019t surprised: it\u2019s tempting to believe that science is apolitical. But science and politics are plainly related: science is the pursuit of knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is politics. \nThe scientific method consists of generating a hypothesis, attempting to disprove the hypothesis through testing, and accumulating those tests to come up with shared knowledge. And that method also contains ideology: our observed, shared world is the real world. This ideology even has a name: empiricism. An incoming president who clearly picks and chooses facts to suit his own version of the world changes the relationship between science and culture, in potentially destructive ways.\nScience is the pursuit of knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is politics\nSurrounding the scientific method is a more obviously political arena: money. Much of American basic science \u2014 the kind of stuff that leads to advances like CRISPR \u2014 is funded by the government. Entities such as the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation are the biggest funders of science in the US; all use public money. Decisions about funding allocation are made by politicians. We may choose to spend more money on defense instead of cancer, for instance, or choose to fund addiction research rather than a new NASA mission. Deciding what science we find valuable is not a scientific decision. It\u2019s a political one. The very idea that the US government should support American science by funding research at all is deeply political.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto of President Elect, Donald J. Trump by Timothy A. Clary / Getty Images\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also made political decisions about what research we won\u2019t do, because although they might increase knowledge, we\u2019ve deemed them harmful. That\u2019s why institutional review boards exist: to protect patients from unethical experimentation. There was a time when this idea was not widely accepted, and it led, in America, to unethical experimentation on vulnerable citizens. Henrietta Lacks\u2019 cells \u2014 the famous HeLa cells that were used to develop the polio vaccine \u2014 were unethically gathered and studied. The Tuskegee syphilis research denied black men adequate treatment for the disease, though it was available, under the guise of learning more about the long-term effects of syphilis. These Americans were used as test subjects without their informed consent \u2014 something we no longer allow. And these ethical decisions sometimes change with elections: George W. Bush created the President\u2019s Council on Bioethics and tightly restricted stem cell research, while Barack Obama dissolved the group and lifted those restrictions. \nEthical decisions sometimes change with elections\nThen there\u2019s the matter of what to do with scientific results, which is often a political decision. The Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 frequently demonized by politicians \u2014 came into existence in part because of a series of conflicts about how land and water were used. Companies once dumped their waste so freely into our watersheds that the Cuyahoga River actually caught fire several times. In the era before emissions control, the 1966 New York Smog killed 168 people. Once scientific data linked pollution to poorer quality of life, politicians acted to make citizens safer. This was a bipartisan issue: Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency as part of that response to pollution data. (And arguably, the real problem with the EPA is that it\u2019s not effective enough: ask anyone in Flint, Michigan who\u2019s gone more than a year without clean water, or anyone who lived downstream from DuPont in West Virginia.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first blush, Donald Trump\u2019s positions on science seem like familiar conservative refrains: denying climate change was also a hallmark of the George W. Bush administration, and vaccination has been controversial since its advent as a public health measure. Environmental regulation has always been disliked by massive corporations; Ronald Reagan attempted to destroy the Environmental Protection Agency, an endeavor at which he failed. Ignoring epidemiologists is also a proud Reagan legacy, and one of the reasons for the AIDS crisis\u2019 devastating toll was his continual refusal to address the problem.\nThose are all familiar politics, with familiar boundaries, in a familiar system. But the Trump administration adds something new: Trump and his advisors have already signaled an unwillingness to hear facts they don\u2019t like, both on vaccine safety and climate change. \nTrump has characterized climate change as a Chinese hoax, which is unlikely to help the people in areas already experiencing higher tides or increasingly strange weather. According to the Department of Defense, not only is climate change real, but it is likely to drive future conflicts between nations and perhaps bears some responsibility for fueling conflicts in Syria. Challenging the science of climate change is one thing; it is what the scientific method is designed to do. Denying the shared reality \u2014 the real reality \u2014 measured by hundreds of independent scientists is another. If the DoD is right, addressing climate change is also a national security issue.\nTrump has already signaled an unwillingness to hear facts he doesn\u2019t like\nTrump has met with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor who manufactured a link between autism and vaccines through research fraud. He\u2019s asked anti-vaccine propagandist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head a new commission \u2014 on what, though, isn\u2019t entirely clear. According to Kennedy, it\u2019s a commission on vaccine safety and on scientific integrity, though Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement that the president-elect is \u201cexploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism.\u201d \nThe link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked at this point. Spending more time and money on it not only ensures that time and money won\u2019t be spent researching something productive, but also wrongly suggests to the average citizen that vaccines are unsafe. Should Trump follow through with this ill-advised commission, it is a political maneuver likely to impact reality in unpleasant ways.\nOutbreaks of preventable illness have already occurred thanks to vaccine-denying parents; it is possible more people will suffer these diseases as a result of the continual sowing of doubt about vaccine safety and efficacy. Arguably, the scientific establishment has a duty to protect the taxpayers that have supported research for so long.\nBut scientists sometimes shirk their moral duty to the populace in order to continue their research. Wernher von Braun has mostly been sidelined in the official history of NASA despite the pivotal role he played in publicizing space travel and building our country\u2019s early rockets. That\u2019s because he also collaborated with Nazis and built rockets using slave labor from concentration camp victims. Somewhat more forgivable is Ivan Pavlov \u2014 the one with the dogs and the saliva \u2014 who stopped openly opposing Joseph Stalin at the end of his life in the hopes of protecting the scientists in his lab; as a result, his lab flourished during Stalin\u2019s purges. Both men will always have asterisks next to their legacies, not because of their scientific work but because of the political alliances they formed in the course of that work.\nPavlov\u2019s example hints at something else. Scientists have office politics, too, and prominent members of the field can blackball younger researchers, preventing them from getting jobs or funding. This environment is part of what\u2019s contributed to a series of sexual harassment scandals over the last few years, across several areas of research. \nScience provides us with facts \u2014 what we do with those facts is deeply political\nThe politics of the highest offices may also affect interpersonal relationships throughout the science community. The Trump administration rewards loyalists and punishes dissenters. Trump has also already signaled a willingness to go after researchers in specific fields, recently asking the Energy Department for a list of employees who have worked on climate change. And it\u2019s unclear what will happen to scientists who experience sexual harassment under a man who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by a number of women.\nScience is a way of seeing that provides us with facts. What we do with those facts is deeply political. Determining whether pollution harms people is a matter of scientific inquiry, but deciding what to do in response to that data is politics. Who uses the water and land, and how? Those aren\u2019t scientific questions \u2014 they\u2019re political ones. Do we value the safety of our citizens or the profits of our corporations? What\u2019s the balance between the two? Those are also political questions. \nNo one can predict exactly how Trump will deal with the scientific community once he\u2019s in office. But the signals his administration has sent so far indicate that the relationship between science and politics is about to become more obvious \u2014 and more controversial \u2014 than ever before. We expect to cover this relationship closely.\nIllustrations by James Bareham / The Verge\n"}
