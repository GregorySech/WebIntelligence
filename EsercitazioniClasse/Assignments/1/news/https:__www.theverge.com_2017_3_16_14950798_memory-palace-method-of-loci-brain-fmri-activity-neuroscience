{"title": "An ancient memorization strategy might cause lasting changes to the brain", "content": " \nWeird as it might sound, there are competitive rememberers out there who can memorize a deck of cards in seconds or dozens of words in minutes. So, naturally, someone decided to study them. It turns out that practicing their techniques doesn't just improve your memory \u2014 it can also change how your brain works.\nThe right kind of memory training may cause lasting changes to the brain\nThere\u2019s been a long-standing debate about whether memory athletes are born with superior memories, or whether their abilities are due to their training regimens. These tend to include an ancient memorization strategy called the method of loci, which involves visualizing important pieces of information placed at key stops along a mental journey. This journey can be an imaginary walk through your house or a local park, or your drive to work. The important thing is that you can mentally move back through it to retrieve the pieces of information you stored. (The ancient Greeks are said to have used it to remember important texts.) \nBoris Nikolai Konrad, a memory coach and athlete who\u2019s in the Guinness Book of World Records for memorizing 201 names and faces in just 15 minutes, chalks his superior memory abilities up to training with this and other mnemonic techniques. \u201cIt's a sport like any other,\u201d Konrad told The Verge. Only, he adds, \u201cyou're not moving that much.\u201d But practicing is key. \n\nSimon Reinhard at South German Memory Championship 2010.\n\nTo find out what\u2019s going on in top-level rememberers\u2019 brains, Konrad teamed up with neuroscientist Martin Dresler at Radboud University in the Netherlands. They recruited 23 of the top 50 memory competitors in the world. All were between the ages of 20 and 36. Then, the scientists scanned the memory athletes\u2019 brains while they were just relaxing, and also while they memorized a list of 72 words.\nThe team, and their co-investigators at Stanford University, found that the memory athletes\u2019 brains don\u2019t appear to be built any differently from yours or mine, according to results they published in the journal Neuron. \u201cThat was quite surprising, since these are really the best memorizers in the world,\u201d Dresler says. \u201cAnd still, they didn\u2019t show a single memory structure, any single region or collection of regions that was anatomically strikingly different from normal control subjects.\u201d \nEven so, their brains don\u2019t work the way yours or mine does. The athletes were able to recall at least 70 of the 72 words they studied \u2014 compared to an average of only 39 words for the non-athletes they were compared to. What\u2019s more, while the professional rememberers\u2019 brains were structurally similar to the control group, the memory athletes\u2019 brain scans showed unique patterns of activity, where brain regions that are involved in memory and cognition were statistically more likely to fire together. \n\n\nHow to build your memory palace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\nThe method of loci is also known as the memory palace, and Konrad says the first step is to make up a set of locations. The place doesn\u2019t matter as much as your familiarity with it. Then you create a map in your mind with a series of stops. The first stop might be your front door. The second could be the table next to it where you put down your sunglasses. Then, when you\u2019re given a list of words to memorize, you visualize scenes that link the words with each stop. \nSay the first word is \u201ckeys,\u201d Konrad says. You probably wouldn\u2019t want to imagine sticking your keys in the lock \u2014 that\u2019s too mundane. It\u2019s better to picture something more vivid: \u201cMaybe someone throwing keys, like arrows in a dart board, into your front door \u2014 and you're a bit scared of that,\u201d Konrad says. That would stick in your memory. So then, when you want to remember the words, you picture yourself walking through the memory journey you plotted out. And when you see the keys sticking out like throwing knives from your front door, you\u2019ll remember the word: keys. \n\n\nTo figure out if the method of loci is behind these memory superpowers, Konrad and Dresler divided 51 men in their 20s who had never trained for or participated in memory competitions into three different groups: one group was trained in the method of loci, and they practiced using an online course for six weeks, 30 minutes per day. One control group got a training regimen of the same length, but played a simple short-term memory game that didn\u2019t involve any strategy. And the other control group didn\u2019t have to do anything but show up for brain scans and memory tests. \nSure enough, after the six weeks were up, the group that trained with the method of loci demolished their previous scores on the second set of memory tests \u2014 recalling an average of 62 of the 72 words, an increase of about 36 words. By contrast, the group practicing with the memory game and the group that didn\u2019t train at all barely improved. \nAdditionally, the same patterns of brain activity that showed up in the memory athletes also started emerging in the group trained with the method of loci. That was true even at rest, when they weren\u2019t trying to memorize anything. That implies the right kind of memory training causes lasting changes to the brain, says Jee Kim, a neuroscientist investigating memory at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Australia who was not involved in this study. \nSo, why does the method of loci work so well? After all, brain-training games like the ones marketed by Lumosity don\u2019t actually make you smarter (which is why Lumosity had to pay $2 million to settle charges of deceptive advertising). And this latest study bears that out \u2014 the group playing the short-term memory brain-training game didn\u2019t improve significantly. \nBut the group using the method of loci did \u2014 and right now, Konrad and Dresler can only speculate as to why. They think it works by taking abstract, unrelated pieces of information and making them signposts on a route \u2014 which incorporates navigational and spatial memory skills humans evolved over time. Ancient people probably didn\u2019t need to remember the order of playing cards of hundreds of names. But, Konrad says, \u201cIt was always important for humans to remember where is shelter, where is food, where is danger \u2014 and therefore our brains can do that easily.\u201d\nThe same patterns of brain activity started emerging in the group that trained like the memory athletes\nThe paper did have some limitations: for one thing, the participants in the training portion of the study were all male, and were all relatively young. So it\u2019s tough to generalize the findings to the broader population \u2014 after all, anyone who\u2019s tried to learn a new language as an adult knows that younger brains are much more primed for learning. The University of Melbourne\u2019s Kim told The Verge in an email that the methods and analyses are sound, and the study adds a new piece to the puzzle. But she also wants to know what biological changes are driving the changes in brain activity, and how that changes with age.\nDresler says those are questions he and his colleagues hope to answer in the future, with more people and more advanced methods. And in the meantime, the take-home point is that memory skills can be learned. \u201cIt shows that superior memory on that level is not something that is just inborn talent, but is something that essentially can be learned by everyone,\u201d Dresler says \u2014 before adding the caveat, \u201cat least, to a certain extent \u2014 probably not everyone will win the world championships.\u201d\n\nUpdated 3/31, 9:47AM EST: Updated Jee Kim\u2019s institutional affiliation.\nUpdated 3/20, 1:25AM EST: Updated to add link to the memory training course used in the study. \n"}
