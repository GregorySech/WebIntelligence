{"title": "Google is already running out of Pixel 2 stock", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been only three hours since Google\u2019s Pixel 2 event wrapped up \u2014 but if you\u2019re planning to buy one and haven\u2019t gotten around to it yet, you\u2019re already late enough to be on the waiting list.\nMany models of the Pixel 2 and every model of the Pixel 2 XL have already seen their delivery dates slip past the phone\u2019s October 19th launch date. Here\u2019s the current situation in the Google Store:\nPixel 2:\nBlack 64GB: In stock.Black 128GB: In stock.White 64GB: 5-6 weeks.White 128GB: 2-3 weeksBlue 64GB: 6-7 weeks\nPixel 2 XL:\nBlack 64GB: 2-3 weeksBlack 128GB: 2-3 weeksWhite 64GB: out of stock, waitlistWhite 128GB: out of stock, waitlist.\nThe situation isn\u2019t great. If you want the smaller Pixel you might be fine, but anyone interested in the larger model is going to have to wait.\nThere is another option, though: Verizon is also selling the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, and it has a bit more availability: all models of the Pixel 2 are currently in stock for October 19th delivery; both capacities of the black 2 XL are pushed back only a week, to October 25th; and both capacities of the white 2 XL are pushed to November 1st. That\u2019s still a delay, but it\u2019s not quite as bad.\nIt\u2019s no huge surprise to see a phone selling out during its preorder period \u2014 Apple does it quickly every single year, and in much, much larger numbers. But in this case, it\u2019s not a great sign for Google. Google had a surprisingly hard time keeping the original Pixel in stock pretty much all year long, and we\u2019ve been waiting to see if it would do better this time around. The company even made a joke about its troubles on stage.\nBut early signs suggest that Google is going to have about as much trouble this year. It\u2019s possible that Pixel 2 preorders were placed in far higher numbers than Google anticipated \u2014 but the Pixel, ultimately, isn\u2019t all that popular yet. So there\u2019s a good chance that this is just a first sign of stocking troubles for the Pixel 2.\n"}
