The Dimmer Switch is installed directly into an outlet, the same as any other traditional light switch, and also features a color-changing LED built in to make it easy to find the switch in the dark. \nThe dimmer is pretty expensive, selling for $99.95, which is the same price iDevices charges for its non-dimmable light switch. It\u2019s available now from the iDevices website.\n"}
