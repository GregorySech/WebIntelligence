{"title": "The new Nissan Pathfinder will honk if you try to leave your kids in a hot car", "content": " \nLet\u2019s face it: people are awful. They\u2019re stupid and forgetful and do terrible things like leave pets and children in hot cars. Safety experts say that an average of 37 children die in locked vehicles every year. And while there is no obvious solution to this particular aspect of humanity\u2019s chronic wretchedness, there are some new safety features coming out soon that can hopefully help prevent these types of tragedies from happening. \nStarting in 2018, the new Nissan Pathfinder will include sensors that can detect when the rear door is opened before a trip, so that if the driver neglects to open the rear door again after the car in parked, the horn will beep several times as a reminder. That way, drivers wouldn\u2019t get more than a few steps away before being reminded to give the backseat a quick check. The new system will also display an alert on the instrument cluster behind the steering wheel, so the driver gets a reminder even before he or she leaves the vehicle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Nissan\n\n\nNissan claims its Rear Door Alert is a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201d but this kind of system isn\u2019t entirely novel. GM has installed a feature called Rear Seat Reminder in a host of its models that sounds a chime and displays a message on the instrument panel to remind drivers to check behind them. Nissan says the honking as an added layer of reminder is what makes its system unique. \n\"By drawing your attention back to the vehicle, once you've walked away, you are more likely to recheck the back seat than with a visual alert alone,\u201d said Elsa Foley, an industrial engineer at Nissan who designed the new feature (and who Nissan saw fit to also describe as a \u201cmother of two\u201d). \nthis kind of system isn\u2019t entirely novel\nSince this feature could likely save the lives of more than just a handful of pets and children, it likely won\u2019t fall into that category of \u201cnew things my car does that I find annoying.\u201d That said, there does seem to be more new vehicle features that buzz, beep, honk, and chime at drivers than ever before. \nLike we\u2019ve already established, people are awful. They fall asleep at the wheel, get distracted by their smartphones, and do other dumb things that get themselves and others killed on the road. But because they\u2019re awful, they also hate to be annoyed. And it seems likely that the more our cars try to warn us about our terrible behavior, the more likely we are to tune out or disable these warnings, thus rendering them moot. \nNissan owners can deactivate the Rear Door Alert system by scrolling through vehicle settings on their instrument panel. But if you\u2019re the forgetful type, it\u2019s not advisable. \n\n"}
