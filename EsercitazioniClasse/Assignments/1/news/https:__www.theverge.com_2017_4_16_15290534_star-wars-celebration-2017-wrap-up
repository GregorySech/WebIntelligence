{"title": "The 13 things we learned from this year\u2019s Star Wars Celebration", "content": " \nStar Wars Celebration has wrapped up in Orlando, Florida, and it\u2019s been a fun four days immersed in everything Star Wars. We\u2019ve learned a lot about the next couple of years of the franchise: we got our first looks at The Last Jedi and Battlefront II, learned the fate of Star Wars Rebels, and heard a bit about Disney\u2019s ambitious plans for its Star Wars-themed parks.  \nHere are some of the biggest things that happened.\n\nThe Last Jedi \n\nThe biggest story of the convention was the first trailer for The Last Jedi, and we learned quite a bit from it. While the trailer was just a couple of minutes of footage, it gave us plenty to speculate over. But director Rian Johnson and several cast members also held a panel about the film, where they revealed some other details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking down The Last Jedi trailer scene by scene\n\n\n\nRey\u2019s meeting with Luke might not go as expected\nAccording to Daisy Ridley, The Last Jedi will go deeper into Rey\u2019s story. At the end of The Force Awakens, she meets Luke Skywalker for the first time, and Ridley says she has certain expectations from him, especially after hearing so many legends and stories. But according to the actress, Rey might end up being disappointed with Luke, given all the grand stories she\u2019s heard. \nKelly Marie Tran is the biggest new character for the film\nActress Kelly Marie Tran is joining the film, playing someone that director Rian Johnson described as the \u201cbiggest new character\u201d in the film. Her name is Rose, and she\u2019s a maintenance worker for the Resistance. She\u2019s not trying to be a hero, but gets pulled into the adventure with Finn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucasfilm\n\n\nBilly Dee Williams won\u2019t be in The Last Jedi\nGiven that The Force Awakens brought back the original trio, Billy Dee Williams returning to reprise his role of Lando Calrissian seemed like a possibility, but Williams shot down the rumors, saying that he hadn\u2019t been asked to return. One of the biggest criticisms of J.J. Abrams\u2019 film was that the movie relied too much on fan service, and that could mean that Rian Johnson isn\u2019t as compelled to rely on the earlier films for inspiration. \nCarrie Fisher won\u2019t appear in Episode IX\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy addressed reports that Fisher would be in Episode IX, clarifying that while the actress will be featured heavily in The Last Jedi, she won\u2019t be appearing in the final saga film. The creative team went back to the drawing board this past January after Fisher\u2019s death, and is reworking the project accordingly.\n\nStar Wars Animation\n\nRebels is ending with season 4 and will tie in more with Rogue One\nThis wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, but it\u2019s still sad news: Rebels will be coming to an end with its next season. However, series creator Dave Filoni said it will end on its own terms, bringing all of the story arcs to a natural conclusion. As the show gets closer to the events of Rogue One and A New Hope, fans should also expect more connections between the stories. The jungle moon of Yavin IV will be a location in the coming season, and we\u2019ll see the return of Saw Gerrera and at least one of his Parisian cell members, as well as the U-Wing starfighter that was prominently featured in Gareth Edwards\u2019 film.  \nThe end of Rebels doesn\u2019t mean the end of Star Wars animation\nFiloni noted that while Rebels was ending, we will see more animated work. He didn\u2019t specify what he meant by that \u2014 whether it\u2019s a new show or some other project \u2014 but we do know that we\u2019ll be getting an animated project, Forces of Destiny, later this fall. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLucasfilm / Walt Disney\n\n\nStar Wars Rebels is ending with its fourth season\n\n\nAnother expanded universe character is coming to Rebels\nGrand Admiral Thrawn appeared in the third season of Rebels, and the crew behind the show isn\u2019t done salvaging bits and pieces from the decanonized storyline. Another character from Timothy Zahn\u2019s novel Heir to the Empire will make an appearance, Rukh. He\u2019ll also be voiced by Star Wars veteran Warwick Davis.    \nAn unfinished Clone Wars episode showed how Boba Fett got a dent in his helmet\nFiloni screened a bit of an unfinished Clone Wars episode, one in which Boba Fett and Cad Bane faced off in a Wild West-style showdown. \n\nAt the end of the confrontation, we see that Fett took a nasty hit to the head, and it left a mark that you later see in the films. \n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II \n\nThe Empire\u2019s elite soldiers are the heroes\nThe huge twist with the game\u2019s single-player campaign is that it\u2019s set entirely from the perspective of Iden, an Imperial special forces officer, and charts her journey as she fights against the Rebellion and New Republic after the Battle of Endor. It\u2019s certainly going to be a different perspective than the usual games that feature more sympathetic heroes. \nThe game will also get a tie-in novel, Battlefront: Inferno Squad, which is set in the aftermath of A New Hope and Rogue One, which shows off the close-knit nature of the new canon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: EA Games\n\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II makes the Imperials the good guys\n\n\nThe story bridges Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens\nIden\u2019s story kicks off as she sees the second Death Star explode, and will continue all the way to the current trilogy. The game was developed with the Lucasfilm Story Group, so the story of Battlefront II will be considered canon within the franchise.\nPlay against friends in any era of Star Wars\nThe multiplayer mode of the new game will go beyond the scope of its predecessor by letting players battle in any era of the franchise, from the prequels all the way up to The Last Jedi. That means more playable heroes, too \u2014 including Darth Maul, Kylo Ren, and Rey. \n\nDisney Parks \n\nVisitors will fly, not ride on, the Millennium Falcon\nDisney revealed some really exciting things about the upcoming Star Wars-themed expansion to its parks in California and Florida. The park experience will be set in the same era as the new trilogy, but most importantly, visitors won\u2019t just sit back and enjoy the ride on the Millennium Falcon attraction. \u201cFlight crews\u201d made up of visitors will be able to actually pilot the ship on its mission. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Lucasfilm / Disney\n\n\nDisney\u2019s Star Wars land sounds like the holy grail of immersive entertainment\n\n\nVisitors can create a reputation in the Star Wars universe\nVisitors aren\u2019t limited to just flying the Millennium Falcon. They\u2019ll get to actively take part in the larger world and story, with the decisions they make in one area of the park actually having consequences when they meet up with other characters in the world. They\u2019ll even be able to join factions: signing up with the First Order, or deciding to go mercenary and head out on a run with some local bounty hunters.\nIt takes place on a world we\u2019ve never seen before\nRather than visiting well-trodden terrain like Tatooine or Hoth, the parks will take us to a planet that we\u2019ve never seen before in the Star Wars universe. Walt Disney Imagineering has worked with the Lucasfilm Story Group to build that new planet from scratch. While they didn\u2019t offer too many details during the panel, they did reveal that it was a remote, frontier outpost that\u2019s a favorite destination for smugglers, and that both the Resistance and the First Order have a presence there. \nWhat we didn\u2019t learn \nWhile we learned quite a bit about the immediate future of Star Wars, there were several things that were left mysteriously unaddressed.\nNext year\u2019s Han Solo film \nGiven that the as-of-yet-untitled Han Solo film is coming out just six months after The Last Jedi, we were hoping that we might get an official title for the film \u2014 or even a brief teaser like Rogue One had two years ago. Neither surfaced.\nThe future of the series beyond the saga movies\nNot only did Lucasfilm not reveal nothing about the Han Solo film, it also avoided discussion of the third standalone movie. We also didn\u2019t learn anything about Lucasfilm and Disney\u2019s ambitions beyond 2020. We know that the companies are looking at at least another decade and a half of films, but Kennedy didn\u2019t reveal anything, other than that we might learn more in the next year or so.  \nPlans for an unaltered original trilogy Blu-ray \nThe 40th anniversary panel seemed like an opportune time to announce some sort of pre-Special Edition original trilogy Blu-ray set, which currently only exists in fan-made releases.  Nothing was announced, however, which means that we\u2019ll keep waiting until the company finally realizes that they\u2019ll sell like hot cakes. \n\n"}
