{"title": "A woman sleeping on an airplane was burned by her exploding headphones", "content": " \nA passenger on a February 19th flight from Beijing, China to Melbourne, Australia was burned when her headphones caught fire. The incident was detailed in a report released today by the Australian government\u2019s Transport Safety Bureau, which stated that the headphones\u2019 batteries were the likely the cause of the fire. The passenger\u2019s name, the name of the airline, and the brand of the headphones were not released. \nThe ATSB says that \u201ca loud explosion\u201d was heard about two hours into the flight. The injured passenger had been sleeping when the headphones exploded. \u201cAs I went to turn around I felt burning on my face,\u201d she told the ATSB. \nThe ATSB didn\u2019t name the headphone brand\nThe passenger says she pulled the headphones down around her neck and then threw them on the floor when she realized they were still on fire. The headphones were sparking when flight attendants doused them with a bucket of water. The batteries were seen melted to the floor once the smoke cleared.\nLithium-ion batteries, which are common in these types of electronics, are susceptible to what\u2019s known as \u201cthermal runaway.\u201d Basically any increase in heat, whether it\u2019s from a fault in the batteries or an outside source, can cause the electrolytes to react with the battery\u2019s other chemicals. This creates a gas, which in turn increases the heat more, and so the problem escalates \u2014 sometimes explosively. \nIt\u2019s unclear if this is exactly what happened on the flight in question, but considering thermal runaway was behind the problems with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and exploding hoverboards, it\u2019s a likely culprit.\n\n\n\n\n"}
