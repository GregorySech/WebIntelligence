{"title": "The new Twin Peaks isn't just violent \u2014 it redefines what violence is", "content": " \nEveryone has their preferred approach when it comes to parsing David Lynch\u2019s enigmatic work. The miraculous new 2017 revival of his landmark 1990 TV series Twin Peaks has seen critics studying each hour from every conceivable angle. Plenty of writers take the traditional road and attempt to divine a plot from what can feel like arbitrarily arranged scenes. Others prefer a formal, more academic analysis. Some read the show through the context of Lynch\u2019s career. And I\u2019m sure someone, somewhere believes they\u2019ve cracked the show\u2019s code though tea leaves. I\u2019ve found it most natural to interpret Twin Peaks on a conceptual level, tracking Lynch\u2019s pet themes as nebulously defined forces that he\u2019s constantly reconfiguring and evolving.\nThrough this lens, the revival series \u2014 ominously dubbed Twin Peaks: The Return \u2014 begins to take shape as a chronicle of one Big Concept in particular. The first 10 episodes of the series\u2019s planned 18-episode run have contained the goriest sequences of Lynch\u2019s work, but now, he\u2019s engaging with the notion of savagery on a deeper, almost spiritual level. Through his signature dreamy conflation of images and feelings, Lynch has constructed a monument to the terrible power of violence, chronicling its genesis and revealing its harsh consequences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Showtime\n\n\nTwin Peaks began as a story oriented around a single atrocity, the murder of small-town homecoming queen Laura Palmer. The series\u2019s original two-season run in the early 1990s focused closely on the impact of that unthinkable act on a small logging town in the Pacific Northwest, to the point where memes have been made out of Laura\u2019s hysterically weeping friends. Other critics have expertly laid out arguments for the show \u2014 and especially its spinoff film, 1992\u2019s Fire Walk With Me \u2014 as an elegy for Laura and a lamentation for everything wasted by her murder. The Return continues that vein of empathy for those touched by tragedy. In a recent sequence, William Hastings (Matthew Lillard) sobs hysterically over his mistress\u2019s death during a police interrogation. Lynch allows his grief to be unruly and melodramatic, toeing the line of comedy without crossing it. He understands that mourning is messy, and gives his characters (and actors) the latitude to express that.\nThe show\u2019s treatment of violence has gotten progressively more complex\nBut violence has assumed chilling new forms in Twin Peaks: The Return, and the show\u2019s treatment of it has accordingly grown more complex. In episode 10, Lynch observes two assaults, shown through diametrically opposed methods: in the first, Lynch holds on an unbroken shot of a trailer as the occupant is murdered. The sounds of her fighting and screaming are chilling, but the static shot leaves an impression of frosty indifference. The second feels far more intimate, operating with close-ups and dialogue that makes the audience privy to the attacker\u2019s white-hot hatred. Even for a filmmaker who\u2019s essentially staked out the nexus of the uncanny and the disturbing as his personal fiefdom, Lynch has doubled down on his experimentalism and overall inscrutability. And that\u2019s granted him access to an elevated sort of cinematic plane, where he can communicate through methods that are less lucid and more primally affecting than ever. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Showtime\n\n\nA nightmare-inducing scene from early in The Return attaches Lynch\u2019s newfound taste for bloodletting to the more off-kilter sensory horror he\u2019s mastered. In a move straight out of Halloween\u2019s playbook, a pair of young lovers get frisky while they\u2019re supposed to be monitoring a mysterious glass cube. A Slender Man-ish figure appears and tears them limb from limb, the dyed corn syrup flowing up the walls as their faces disintegrate. But the truly harrowing aspect of the scene isn\u2019t the gristle, or even the unidentified creature\u2019s inhuman, putty-looking visage. Lynch\u2019s technique of shaking the bejesus out of the camera is what clinches the scene. The thing looks like it\u2019s liable to break out of your screen at any moment.\nLynch has weaponized the TV frame itself, using color, motion, light, and sound to create a physical aggression in his images, and shock his audience. Through the showbiz magic known as \u201cpressuring Showtime into giving him final-cut authority,\u201d Lynch recently pulled off the single most avant-garde hour of TV in the medium\u2019s history. Episode 8 of the series sees Lynch pulling every formal trick out of his sleeve to establish an atmosphere of violence located in another dimension. Through double exposure, stroboscopic lights, and jarring hyperactive cuts, he destabilizes viewers and leaves them with no way to get their bearings. He\u2019s attacking people on a subconscious level, manipulating white noise on the audio mix so it continuously fades in and out of awareness. It\u2019s an alien sort of violence, a distinct variety that promotes a feeling of insecurity and threat, rather than immediate danger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Showtime\n\n\nKeeping with its unsettlingly intense focus on the aesthetics and mechanics of hostility, episode 8 also functioned as a dark origin story for the presence of evil itself on Earth. The sight of a detonating atom bomb has lurked around the periphery of the show, wallpapering the office of FBI agent Gordon Cole (Lynch himself), but the image dominates episode 8. The story revolves around that symbolic loss of innocence for humanity, the moment that compelled nuclear physicist Kenneth Bainbridge to declare he and his colleagues to be \u201csons of bitches.\u201d It\u2019s the birth of a bloodless, incinerating, indifferent instrument of destruction. It inspires fear not for what it is, but for what it represents: a pure expression of man\u2019s will to do harm. The knife was conceived as a multipurpose outdoor tool, the gun ostensibly for hunting or protection. But the atomic bomb was created with the express purpose of reducing human populations to dust.\nDavid Lynch has a trembling reverence for violence\nEven when Lynch is illustrating mankind\u2019s potential for destruction, he maintains a trembling reverence for the violence they create. There\u2019s a horrible beauty to the way Lynch looks at the mushroom cloud, examining it in slow motion, far removed, like a tornado seen from space. He regards the impulse to mangle or otherwise destroy as an elemental force in the universe.\nThat theme extends to his characters as well. The clear dichotomy between baffled protagonist Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) in his current unaware incarnation as Dougie Jones, and the seemingly unkillable, possessed Evil Dale reinforces Lynch\u2019s essential interplay between negative and positive energy. Neither one can exist without the other, and they\u2019re inexorably drawn together. They obey the same cosmic laws as Einstein\u2019s entangled atoms. Violence is inescapable, in the air or inside the characters\u2019 brains. And in Twin Peaks, it always has a touch of the unnatural and otherworldly. A scene where Evil Dale gets shot comes off as weirdly pedestrian \u2014 and then the ghostly homeless cannibal zombies arrive. Violence is returned to its proper pedestal, as an intensely personal act that\u2019s impossible to fully understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Showtime\n\n\nTwin Peaks initially sold itself as a murder mystery, but Lynch and his co-showrunner Mark Frost had more compelling questions on the brain than the identity of Laura\u2019s killer. MacLachlan himself asked the right questions, but in another role for Lynch, playing a compromised innocent facing a sadistic thug in 1986\u2019s Blue Velvet. \u201cWhy are there people like Frank?\u201d MacLachlan\u2019s character asks. \u201cWhy is there so much trouble in the world?\u201d The Return has continued the original series\u2019s shamanic investigation into the true nature of that trouble. But while the show submits to that omnipresent violence, it doesn\u2019t share Jeffrey\u2019s tone of panic. Lynch hasn\u2019t made peace with the permanent existence of evil, by any means. He\u2019s just endlessly interested in the battle to keep it at bay.\nTwin Peaks: The Return airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime.\n"}
