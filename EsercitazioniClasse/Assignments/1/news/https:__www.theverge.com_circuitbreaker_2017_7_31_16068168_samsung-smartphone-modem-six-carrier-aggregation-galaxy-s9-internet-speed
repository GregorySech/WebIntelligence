{"title": "Samsung\u2019s new modem could make the Galaxy S9 the fastest smartphone yet", "content": " \nSamsung\u2019s next smartphones could get even faster. The company announced that the next version of its LTE modem for its Exynos chipsets now supports up to six carrier aggregation (6CA), allowing it to hypothetically reach download speeds of up to 1.2Gbps.\nFor a brief recap, carrier aggregation is a method where LTE speeds are increased by using multiple LTE bands across the spectrum at the same time, resulting in increased bandwidth speeds. The more bands supported \u2014 in Samsung\u2019s case, that\u2019s up from the modem built into the S8\u2019s Exynos 9 processor, which offers 5CA \u2014 the higher the theoretical data rate. In other words: while the Galaxy S8 might have been the first gigabit smartphone, its successor could offer up to 20 percent faster data speeds due to the new tech. \nOf course, supporting 6CA on Samsung\u2019s side of things is only half of the solution \u2014 carriers will need to switch on support for 6CA on their end, too. As of earlier this year, carriers like Sprint had just added support for three-carrier aggregation, so there\u2019s still a long way to go before Samsung\u2019s new modem has its potential fully realized. Samsung is planning on producing processors with the new modem by the end of this year, making it a pretty likely bet that we\u2019ll be seeing this tech appear on next year\u2019s Galaxy S9 phones. \n"}
