{"title": "Oculus Rift price drops permanently to $399", "content": " Oculus is permanently dropping its Rift headset price to $399. The change was announced at this year\u2019s Oculus Connect conference, and it effectively brings back the sale price we got this summer, a $100 cut from the current $499 price. As before, this bundle includes both the Oculus Rift headset and Oculus Touch motion controllers.With this discount, the Rift is around half the price it launched at last year, when the headset cost $599 and the Touch controllers were $199. Oculus hasn\u2019t announced firm numbers, but the summer sale was rumored to have boosted its Rift sales quite a bit, and stimulated the sale of new VR games. Virtual reality has had a slow start, so this kind of price cut is a good move toward making VR more accessible.The Rift will be less convenient than the wireless, self-contained VR system Oculus is now promoting, codenamed Santa Cruz. But Oculus has promised the Rift isn\u2019t going away, and in theory, people who buy it now will still have plenty to play in the upcoming year or two."}
