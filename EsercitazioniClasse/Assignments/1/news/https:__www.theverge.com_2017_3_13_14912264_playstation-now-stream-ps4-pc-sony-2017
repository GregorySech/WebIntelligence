{"title": "Sony\u2019s PlayStation Now service will stream PS4 games to your PC later this year", "content": " \nSony announced today that it\u2019s expanding its PlayStation Now streaming service to include current-generation PS4 games. Currently the service lets players stream legacy PlayStation 3 games to PS4s and PCs for a $19.99 monthly cost. PS4 games will be added to PS Now at no additional cost to subscribers, but Sony isn\u2019t saying exactly when to expect the new titles to be added to the catalog or what games to expect to be able to play. \nSony recently announced that it would be discontinuing PS Now service on the PS3, PS Vita, PlayStation TV, and all supported smart TVs and Blu-ray players in August to better focus on developing the service for the PS4 and PC platforms, which will presumably be the only devices to get the new PS4 game streaming. Today\u2019s news also comes on the heels of Microsoft announcing its own monthly games subscription, Xbox Game Pass. Like PS Now, Xbox Game Pass will offer a library of Xbox One and Xbox 360 games to subscribers, but at a lower $9.99 a month cost. Additionally, Microsoft\u2019s service will allow players to fully download games, unlike PS Now, which only allows players stream them.\n"}
