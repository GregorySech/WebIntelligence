{"content": " The last Harry Potter movie came out in 2011, but in that time, the best way to relive the series has been to buy the movies outright or wait for an ABC Family  er, Freeform  marathon of the films; they\u2019ve never really been available on any major streaming service in the US. Fortunately for Potter fans, that\u2019ll be changing on January 1st, 2018, when all 8 Harry Potter films are coming to HBO Go and HBO Now for on-demand streaming, via Business Insider reporter Kim Renfro. HBO will also be marking the occasion by airing a straight marathon of all eight films  and Fantastic Beasts . Whoa, all eight #HarryPotter films will be available to stream on @HBO starting New Year's Day 2018 \u26a1\ufe0f\u2728 First time they're all in one place! pic.twitter.com/tMy9MPVqGO\u2014 Kim Renfro  @kimrrenfro  November 9, 2017The availability on HBO comes alongside a shift in the basic cable rights of the Potter films from Disney, which previously owned them, to NBCUniversal, which will be airing the films on SyFy and USA Network starting in 2018. The choice of HBO as the streaming home also makes sense, given that Harry Potter is a Warner Bros. property, and both HBO and Warner Bros. are owned by Time Warner cable. For the complete Potter experience, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is actually already on HBO\u2019s streaming services, should you want to get an early start on your marathon.
