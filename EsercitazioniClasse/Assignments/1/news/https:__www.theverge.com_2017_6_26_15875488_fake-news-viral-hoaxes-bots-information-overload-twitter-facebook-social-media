{"title": "Your short attention span could help fake news spread", "content": " \nFake news and viral hoaxes spread online because of our short attention spans and the deluge of new information that\u2019s constantly pouring into social media, a new study says. But reining in the bots that spit out huge numbers of posts could help curtail the information overload that makes it hard to sort fact from fiction, the study authors say.\n The truth doesn\u2019t always prevail online\nSocial media\u2019s amplification of online misinformation emerged with a vengeance during the 2016 presidential election, although it\u2019s still not clear exactly how much \u201cfake news\u201d influenced the election\u2019s outcome. Still, with the majority of American adults getting their news from social media, understanding what makes false or mistaken ideas spread online has high, real-world stakes. \nThat\u2019s why a team of researchers from Indiana University, Shanghai Institute of Technology, and Yahoo Research set out to determine why the truth doesn\u2019t always prevail online. They published their findings today in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. \nTheir first step was to create a simulated, and simplified, social network. In this network, each virtual user \u2014 not an actual person \u2014 sees a reverse chronological feed, kind of like the one on Twitter. Then the researchers introduced a few variables, including the number of new messages or posts that flow into the user\u2019s feed, how much attention that user devotes to scrolling through the posts, and the quality of the ideas or memes in each post. The \u201cquality\u201d variable is a little tricky, because it can mean different things for different media: for a picture, it could be its beauty, and for a claim or a statement, its accuracy. \nBy tracking 100,000 different posts across 20 different simulations, the researchers learned that generally, higher-quality ideas \u2014 more beautiful photos, or truer statements \u2014 are better at spreading through the network. But if the social network is constantly deluged by new posts and the users don\u2019t have infinite attention spans (which, we don\u2019t), the group loses its ability to discriminate between good and bad ideas. Basically, for high-quality posts to win the sharing war on social media, the volume of new information flowing into that network has to be pretty low, and the users\u2019 attention spans have to be pretty high. \nAn online marketplace of ideas \u201cthat is incapable of discriminating information on the basis of quality.\u201d\nNow, this is a simulation \u2014 and it makes some pretty oversimplified assumptions. So to add real-world numbers, the team analyzed Twitter data from 2014 to understand how fast new ideas are added to the network, and how many new posts users tweet versus how many they retweet. From Tumblr, the researchers calculated users\u2019 average scrolling behavior, and how long they lingered on posts. Plugging this info into their model painted a frightening picture of an online marketplace of ideas \u201cthat is incapable of discriminating information on the basis of quality,\u201d the authors write. \nAgain, this is a model, and more studies will need to be done to verify whether people actually do behave this way. But real-world sharing behavior at least initially appears to back up the results: posts determined to be hoaxes by rumor-checking site Emergent.info spread just as virally as posts that fact-checked those hoaxes or shared true information. \nCutting down on information overload could help people distinguish real from fake news on social media, and one way to do that could be for companies like Facebook and Twitter to remove the bots that churn out lots of low-quality posts. But as Facebook\u2019s strategy for dealing with disinformation revealed earlier this year, that\u2019s no small task. \n\n"}
