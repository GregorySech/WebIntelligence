{"title": "The 6 biggest announcements from the Galaxy S8 event", "content": " \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus were announced today, as were new versions of the Gear 360, an updated Gear VR with a motion controller, and a competitor to Siri and Google Assistant. Months of leaks mean we had a pretty good handle on what basically all of Samsung\u2019s new flagships and other announcements would look like. But now we finally have the full picture.\nThe new phones are the obvious highlight. (They start at $720 and will be available for preorder starting March 30th, by the way.) But phones these days are more than just phones, and Samsung\u2019s spent the last few years really building out the \u201cgalaxy\u201d (get it?) of products and services that work with its flagships. That means much of Samsung\u2019s event was spent talking about other things like virtual reality, or Bixby, Samsung\u2019s new digital assistant, and even DeX, the new computer crossover dock.\nThat\u2019s a lot! So here are the biggest takeaways from today\u2019s event. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus \nThe screens on the new S8 and S8 Plus are what stand out the most, even if you\u2019re just looking at images on a laptop, so let\u2019s start there. They\u2019re huge compared to what we\u2019ve gotten used to over the last few years \u2014 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches, respectively \u2014 and they stretch almost completely to the edges of each device. \nThe S8 is slightly bigger than an iPhone 7 but smaller than an S7 Edge \u2014 and it has the biggest screen of all three\nBut what\u2019s impressive about their size is that Samsung fit the new screens into bodies that aren\u2019t much bigger than what premium smartphone owners have become accustomed to. The S8, for example, is smaller than an S7 Edge but not much bigger than an iPhone 7 \u2014 despite the fact that it has a bigger screen than both of those phones. The screens also come in an unfamiliar aspect ratio, 18.5:9. The company explained that it plans to use this to automatically stretch 21:9 content (like movies), and that it should help enhance the multitasking experience in Android 7.0 Nougat.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretching the screens means that Samsung had to make a choice about what to do with the physical home button. In short, it\u2019s gone. The (mostly standard) Android software buttons remain, but without a physical home button, Samsung made a section of the bottom of the screen pressure-sensitive. \nSamsung calls this the \u201cinvisible home button,\u201d but the bottom line is the phone uses haptic feedback to simulate the feeling of pressing a real button, similar to what Apple does with Force Touch on the latest iPhones.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nSamsung Galaxy S8 review: ahead of the curve\n\nThis change means that the fingerprint reader has been moved to the back. It\u2019s not in the center, like on the Nexus 5X and 6P or the Google Pixel. Instead, it\u2019s up near the camera module, meaning it\u2019ll be a stretch for some users \u2014 especially with the bigger S8 Plus. \nSamsung\u2019s not the first to nearly kill the bezel, but who cares? These screens look gorgeous\nSamsung\u2019s not the first company to push for a bezel-less phone, but it\u2019s now one of the highest profile to make an attempt. If this is really the future of smartphone design, the S8 will be remembered as one of those pioneering devices. \n\n\nHere are a few more tidbits about the S8 and S8 Plus:\n\nRuns Android 7.0 Nougat\nIP68 water and dust resistant\nThere\u2019s a headphone jack!\nCapable of wireless charging\nCarries over the Note 7\u2019s iris scanning, and also adds a face-scanning feature\n\n\nFor all the specs, check out our breakdown of the new Galaxy S8 phones here.\n\n\nThe camera is one thing that Samsung didn\u2019t change much from the S7. The S8 phones have the same 12-megapixel sensor camera with optical image stabilization on the back, while the front camera gets a bump up from 5 to 8 megapixels. Otherwise, there\u2019s no spec bumps and no dual-camera trickery. The Galaxy S7 had a fantastic camera \u2014 in some settings, it was the best on the market \u2014 and so Samsung is letting it ride for another year. \nOne thing Samsung says it has changed with the camera can be found under the hood.  The S8\u2019s camera will be able to take multiple shots at basically the same time, and it will combine the best parts of each image. That sounds awfully similar to the Google Pixel\u2019s HDR+ mode, so if it\u2019s even half as good, that\u2019s a welcome addition.\nAnd one other small but notable difference is that, with no home button, Samsung moved the camera shortcut to the power button. I have my reservations on whether that will be as good, but our own Dieter Bohn seems to like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Samsung\n\n\nNew batteries, (hopefully) fewer explosions  \nBy now, you probably know the ballad of the Galaxy Note 7. It was one of the most promising devices of the last few years, and then shortly after its release, a number of the smartphones started randomly catching fire and outright exploding. Samsung\u2019s replacements also caught fire, and so the company recalled the device completely.\nWhat this means for the S8 is that the batteries aren\u2019t boundary-pushing. The S8 has a 3,000mAh battery, and the S8 Plus has a 3,500mAh version \u2014 the same size that was found in the Note 7. Samsung has a lot to say about how its improved safety testing process in this feature that Dan Seifert wrote about the new phones, so if you\u2019re curious (or still worried), that\u2019s a good place to start. The point is these phones should last through your typical day, nothing more. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bixby digital assistant\nHere\u2019s the most important thing you need to know about Bixby: Samsung has enough faith in the new digital assistant that Bixby gets its own physical button on the new phones. That\u2019s commitment to an idea. \nIn some ways, Bixby sounds not all too different from other digital assistants. You can ask it to set an alarm or a reminder, for example. But Samsung is promising that \u201canything you can control with touch, you can also control with voice,\u201d which is a big bet. Ten Samsung apps will support Bixby\u2019s deep voice controls at launch, allowing users to do things like rotate a photo with their voice. Beyond that, Samsung needs developers to write apps that specifically support Bixby. \nSamsung gave Bixby its own button on the S8\nBixby also shows up in the camera app, where it offers some augmented reality features. But all we know that it can do here is identify objects and generate a \u201cbuy\u201d link. Whether or not Samsung will come up with a more useful take on augmented reality remains to be seen. \nSamsung\u2019s Bixby is up against some tough competition in Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google\u2019s Assistant, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana. Bixby looks like it could be different enough, but we won\u2019t know for sure until we spend some more time with the new phones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Gear 360\nSamsung\u2019s new Gear 360 has just about everything you\u2019d want in an upgrade. It shoots an actual 4K image. It can now live stream. Maybe most importantly, Samsung expanded the compatibility, meaning you can use the new camera with other phones \u2014 namely, the iPhone. \nWhat we didn\u2019t hear from Samsung is when it will be available, or for how much. We also don\u2019t know whether the company figured out a way to speed up the file transfers, or the time required to process and stitch the footage. And while the new design \u2014 which is admittedly adorable \u2014 is supposed to make the device more approachable, it also runs the risk of encouraging people to shoot 360 video handheld. That\u2019s not good. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNew\u201d Gear VR and motion controller, plus a refreshed user interface\nAnnounced last month at Mobile World Congress, Samsung officially introduced the new(ish) Gear VR, which mostly just got a fresh coat of paint. The more exciting part of the announcement is the motion controller. Following in the steps of Google\u2019s mobile VR headset, Daydream, the controller has a touch-sensitive trackpad, a trigger, and a few other buttons.\nOur first impression of the controller wasn\u2019t particularly flattering, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. It will sold bundled with the refreshed Gear VR for $129, and it will be sold separately for existing users for $39. It will hopefully enhance the Gear VR experience while also inspiring developers to try to push what the mobile VR rig is capable of.\nSamsung and Oculus also announced a brand-new home screen for the Gear VR. It\u2019s supposed to be faster and look better, which is nice. It\u2019s also far simpler \u2014 which is so welcome \u2014  and it adds the customizable avatars that Oculus announced for the Rift last fall. There\u2019s also now a VR web browser available, so get ready to kick back on the couch and beam your favorite websites right to your eyeballs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung DeX\nDeX is a dock for the S8 and S8 Plus that can turn any monitor into a PC-like experience. Sound familiar? It\u2019s another idea that\u2019s been tried before, notably by Motorola and Microsoft, but it\u2019s never really lived up to the promise. \nThe DeX dock supports monitor connection over HDMI, and allows for a keyboard, mouse, and two USB ports. There\u2019s even a cooling fan inside to keep the Galaxy S8  from overheating it. The whole thing is powered by USB-C. \nSamsung\u2019s take isn\u2019t all that different from its predecessors. It\u2019s still basically just mobile apps running on a bigger window, and because of that, you\u2019re stuck dealing with all the trappings of mobile apps. For instance, the phone doesn\u2019t hold the apps or app windows in place if you unplug the phone from the dock and plug it back in.\nLike other leading smartphones, the S8 and S8 Plus have fantastic processors inside. It\u2019s understandable why Samsung would want to try to push the capabilities of those chips by extending the phone beyond its hardware. But again, Samsung has to prove that DeX is worth the customer\u2019s money \u2014 whatever the dock winds up costing. \nSee all of the Samsung news right here! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
