{"title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 guide reveals dual Bluetooth audio function and more", "content": " \nSamsung is finally taking the wraps off the Galaxy S8 later today in New York, but we\u2019ve still got time to squeeze in a few more leaks. Like, for example, the phone\u2019s user guide. Yep, the whole document got posted online earlier at Samsung\u2019s download center (the link\u2019s here, but it\u2019s locked away behind a password now). Phandroid caught it before it got sealed up, and although there aren\u2019t many surprises, it\u2019s still a good overview of what the S8 will be offering. \nThere\u2019s the \u201cEdge screen\u201d with its super-slim bezels, the intelligent assistant Bixby (capable of navigating the UI, setting reminders, and performing image searches from your camera), and Samsung Dex \u2014 which allows you to connect the phone to an external display and use it like a computer with keyboard and mouse. \nRead more: How to watch the Samsung Galaxy S8 event\n\nSome things we\u2019ve not seen before also show up in the guide, including a \u201cBluetooth dual audio\u201d feature.
