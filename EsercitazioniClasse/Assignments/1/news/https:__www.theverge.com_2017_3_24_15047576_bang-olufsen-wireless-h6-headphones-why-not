{"title": "Bang & Olufsen can make a wireless version of the brilliant H6 headphones, but chooses not to", "content": " \nRegular readers of The Verge will know that my \u2014 and, by extension, the world\u2019s \u2014 favorite portable over-ear headphones are the $299 Beoplay H6 from Bang & Olufsen\u2019s B&O Play sub-brand. They are wonderfully musical, fun, and enjoyable to listen to with any genre of music. Plus they have the brilliant B&O design and materials that make me envious of anyone else wearing them even when I have my own pair. But they\u2019re not wireless.\nThe hot new thing in headphones these days is the turn toward wireless convenience, and I\u2019ve spent the months since reviewing the H6s looking for an equally good wireless model. Not even the flagship Beoplay H9 could topple the sound quality and pleasure of the H6s, in my judgment, so I had to ask B&O about what\u2019s stopping it from releasing a wireless H6 pair. The answer, it turns out, is nothing technical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\nSpeaking with B&O Tonmeister Geoff Martin (who\u2019s responsible for tuning everything right up to the company\u2019s $80-something-thousand BeoLab 90 speakers) this week, I asked directly if the company could produce a wireless H6. And he answered, just as directly: \"yes.\" The actual reason for why B&O Play doesn\u2019t offer a wireless headphone tuned like the H6 is that its sound signature is too light on bass to be used in the noisy environments of an underground commute or a long flight. That\u2019s why the wireless models that B&O Play does offer \u2014 the H7, H8, and H9 \u2014 have an extra slice of low-end rumble, with the intention being that they\u2019ll sound their best when circumstances around the listener are less than ideal.\nI\u2019ve used the Beoplay H6 while making my way around the interminably noisy London, and I can\u2019t say I strictly agree with B&O\u2019s position, but I can see the sense in that thinking. I did find competitor Bowers & WIlkins\u2019 wireless P7 headphones were at their best when out in a noisy environment. Having said that, though, I think B&O and Bowers & Wilkins are both ignoring the audience that wants uncompromised sound quality and wireless ease of use without necessarily needing to have a pair of commuter headphones. I\u2019m thinking of the high-fidelity enthusiasts that need a nice pair of cans for the office or anyone with a distaste for disconnecting from their music anytime they have to leave their desk. Okay, it\u2019s very much a me scenario, but I believe my desires are shared by more people than B&O thinks.\nSo help me out, guys. If you haven\u2019t yet tried the Beoplay H6, do, and when you get a grasp of their excellence, let Bang & Olufsen know that you too would fancy a pair without the cord. Those might be the sweetest and loveliest over-ear headphones that most of us can afford \u2014 if only B&O would go to the trouble of building them.\n"}
