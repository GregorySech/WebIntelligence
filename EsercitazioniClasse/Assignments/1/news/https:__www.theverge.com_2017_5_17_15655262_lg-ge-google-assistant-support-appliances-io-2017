{"title": "LG and GE add Google Assistant support to fridges, washers, ovens, and more", "content": " \nGoogle said today that we\u2019re going to start seeing appliances show up with support for the Google Assistant, and two companies are already launching integrations: LG and GE.\nBoth companies are updating their existing lines of connected appliances so that they can be controlled through the Google Home and Assistant. Supported appliances including fridges, ovens, washers and dryers, an air purifier from LG, and an air conditioner and water heater from GE.\nAmazon beat Google to this type of integration\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be able to speak directly to these appliances to control them, however. You\u2019ll still have to use one of the existing Google Assistant interfaces \u2014 your phone or a Google Home \u2014 but they\u2019ll be able to handle commands that you had to open up LG\u2019s or GE\u2019s app to handle in the past.\nThat said, the experience sounds slightly awkward, since you\u2019ll have to be very specific in your requests to the Google Assistant. With GE, for instance, you\u2019ll have to say \u201cOK Google, ask Geneva Home if the dishes are clean,\u201d since Geneva Home is the name of its connected app. It\u2019d be simpler if you could just ask, \u201cAre the dishes clean?\u201d How many dishwashers could you possibly be trying to check, anyway?\nLG says it\u2019ll begin rolling out support for the Assistant this month. GE says its support will launch today.\nWhile this is an important get for Google, it isn\u2019t breaking new ground here. GE has already had Alexa support on all of these appliances, and LG even launched a fridge with built-in Alexa that you can speak to.\nDuring a presentation at the I/O conference today, Google said that we\u2019ll start to see \u201cGoogle Assistant Built In\u201d badges on supported products. A slide in the presentation said we\u2019ll start to see support from Sony, Panasonic, Onkyo, and other familiar appliance brands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\n"}
