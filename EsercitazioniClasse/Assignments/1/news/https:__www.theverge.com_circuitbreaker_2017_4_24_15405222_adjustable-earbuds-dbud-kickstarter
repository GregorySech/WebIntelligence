{"title": "These fancy earbuds have a built-in slider for letting in more or less noise", "content": " \nI confess to being an earplug obsessive. I have a favorite brand (Howard Leight Laser Lites) and I buy my \u2018plugs in bulk, scattering them like candy in bags, drawers, and pockets for easy-access silence. It\u2019s an affordable luxury I recommend to anyone.\nBut my earplugs are disposable, and I like the idea of getting something a bit more durable and functional. Enter the dBud. These are a pair of adjustable ear plugs currently raising funds (and fully funded) on Kickstarter. They have a built in slider that lets you switch between \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d positions, reducing noise intake by 15 decibels or 30 dB. Their creators, Swedish company EarLab, promise that a built-in \u201cacoustic filter\u201d (basically a fabric mesh \u2014 there are no electronics in the dBuds) also allow wearers to block out loud sounds, while still hearing nearby noises, like conversations. Build in magnets round off the design features, letting you click the buds together for safe keeping. It\u2019s a neat package, and the adjustable filtering mechanism seems to be in vogue right now. A similar product called Knops is also raising funds on Kickstarter (though they\u2019re pricier \u2014 $62 a pair instead of $49). \n\nThe question is, do the dBuds work as well as EarLab promises? The company\u2019s promo video is very flashy, but at the end of the day, these are just earplugs with a built-in slider. They don\u2019t offer the sort of sophisticated sound filtering you get with electronic buds like Doppler\u2019s Here One. On the other hand, they don\u2019t have to be charged, and I very much hate the idea of charging my earplugs. Hopefully we can get our ears on a pair of dBuds to test their claims for ourselves some time soon. \n"}
