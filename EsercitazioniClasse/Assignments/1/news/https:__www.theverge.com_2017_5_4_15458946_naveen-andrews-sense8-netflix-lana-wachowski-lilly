{"title": "Naveen Andrews considers Sense8 \u2018a direct fuck you\u2019 to global fascism", "content": " \nOn Friday, May 5th, when Netflix releases the second season of its original series Sense8, viewers will finally start getting a clearer idea of what\u2019s going on with Naveen Andrews\u2019 central character, Jonas. The show, about a \u201ccluster\u201d of \u201csensates\u201d \u2014 eight psychically connected spiritual siblings capable of sharing skills and experiences \u2014 is the latest project from Lana and Lilly Wachowski, writer-directors of Bound, the Matrix trilogy, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas, and Jupiter Ascending. The Wachowskis, both trans women who\u2019ve drawn on themes of metamorphosis, transcendence, and resurrection throughout their shared career, have turned Sense8 into another story about human evolution and transformation. \nThe show\u2019s central characters are all from different countries and struggling with radically different issues. But they all experience joy and grief in the same human ways, and as the second season continues the story, they\u2019ve learned to support and communicate with each other across world-spanning distances. That\u2019s necessary as they\u2019ve become more aware of the forces trying to control, contain, or destroy them.\nBut Andrews, a London-born actor who starred in The English Patient and Lost, plays an outsider, a sensate whose cluster is dead and whose loyalties are unclear and frequently questioned. His character, who serves as a mentor and guide to the protagonists, has drawn a great deal of speculation from series fans. Much like his fan-favorite character in Lost, former Iraqi Republican Guard torturer Sayid Jarrah, Jonas has been a sort of quiet mystery. I recently sat down with Andrews in New York City to talk about why the show is important to him, how he came to the role, and what it was like working more directly with Lana Wachowski on the second season, as Lilly took a leave of absence to deal with her transition. \nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nI understand that your audition for Sense8 wound up being hours of talking with Lana and Lilly Wachowski about your life. What did they want to know? What was important to their process?\nI think what\u2019s important to Lana is, she needs to know who she\u2019s going to be working with, to put it very simply. But really know. As opposed to a facsimile that somebody might come in and present because they\u2019re coming in for a job, obviously. If you can communicate with her, and let her know where you\u2019re coming from, I suppose, where you\u2019re at, if we\u2019re using arcane language. Maybe that\u2019s a generational divide \u2014 we were all born in the late 20th century, and that\u2019s why we use terms like \u201cWhere it\u2019s at.\u201d But yes, it was like two and a half hours of my life, which at the time, was slightly disconcerting, because I thought, \u201cAm I talking my way out of this job? How important is this, really?\u201d But apparently it was. I think they just want to get to know you, as a human being.\nDid they learn anything that went into your character?\nYes, there\u2019s definitely certain aspects of Jonas that Lana drew on from me. And she let me know that at the time. About relationships I might have had when I was very young, 16 or 17, and how important they were, how they informed me as an adult, I suppose.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a writer, was she interested in your input into the character?\nOh absolutely, but only to an extent, because you have to be ready to change at any point, at any place in the world, on the day. You have to remain open to that, because nothing is fixed. \nFor the central group of sensates, Sense8 is about shared emotions and experience around the world. But Jonas is an outsider to the group. He\u2019s older, and the last of his cluster, so he\u2019s separated in so many ways from the core experiences of the show. Given that, what\u2019s the show about for you?\nI was talking to Terrence [Mann, who plays the series\u2019s antagonist, Mr. Whispers] and Daryl [Hannah] about this! Our characters, in terms of how much we work, are literally parachuted in and then taken out again, miraculously so. And that\u2019s the dynamic of our work schedule. We drop in on Berlin and then leave. When you said Jonas was an outsider, it seems at least the way the writing\u2019s been developing, and in this season in particular, he\u2019s an outsider for a reason. He seems to have been compromised in some way, and we still don\u2019t know the nature of that compromise\u2026 infuriatingly so! So for him, the show is about how he\u2019s been thwarted. We just don\u2019t know how yet. \nDo you have any sense of where the character will go in the long term, like what his true motivations are, or are you discovering that script by script?\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019m discovering script by script. \nAs an actor, how do you put together a character when you don\u2019t know his true motivations or intentions?\n\u201cWe are complex; we\u2019re not just one thing or another at any given time. Hopefully.\u201d\nWell, I have to say, I\u2019ve had some experience with this before. [Laughs] With Lost, some members of the cast would literally open the script and find out that they were dead. I mean, that\u2019s quite sad, really. I think what you can return to is what one draws from the experience of living one\u2019s own life. We are complex; we\u2019re not just one thing or another at any given time. Hopefully. Obviously there are some people who just are who they are, unfortunately. And they occupy positions of power. But let\u2019s leave that, I digress. Just any human being is this wonderful conglomeration of experiences and behaviors, if you like \u2014 some of them healthy, some of them not so healthy.\nJonas has been such a center for fan theories, for people picking him apart line by line. How do you feel about that level of scrutiny? \nI\u2019m glad there\u2019s interest, obviously, but it has nothing to do with me. I don\u2019t read it. I try to remain unaware of it, because my job is to just render the work. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s there.\nHow has this season been different for you with Lana working as a solo director?\nThat\u2019s a good question, because we thought maybe Lilly might be working with her via phone calls, emails, that sort of thing. We wondered if they were communicating. And we don\u2019t know, is the short answer to that. It\u2019s the first time Lana approached a project without her sibling, and I thought she did brilliantly, considering, because obviously she relies on Lilly for a lot of support. But we don\u2019t know whether Lilly might return.\nFor practical purposes\u2026 it used to be, Lana would give you a note, and then Lilly would move in and give you a note, and it would be the opposite. [Laughs] And then I\u2019d say to Lana, \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d And she\u2019d say, \u201cDo what she said!\u201d The only difference is, now it\u2019s just a little more straightforward.\nWhat\u2019s Lana told you as a director that\u2019s been most useful to you?\nI think what\u2019s unique about Lana is that she draws on the emotional mood of a room, which,of course, can change at any given moment. She seems to be viscerally connected to the camera. Like, she\u2019s literarily behind [Steadicam operator] Daniele [Massaccesi] \u2014 who shot The English Patient, so it\u2019s weird for me, seeing him there again \u2014 and she has her hands on his back, and she\u2019s steering him toward you, and then pulling him back, and then pushing him in again. And she\u2019s talking to you the whole time this is happening, yeah? And I\u2019ve never had that before, like \u201cRepeat the line!\u201d \u201cSay that again!\u201d \u201cNow with a different inflection, because you\u2019re thinking about something else!\u201d \u201cNow say this line as Whispers, and see what it means!\u201d It\u2019s tremendously exciting, because you discover things about the part that you\u2019ve never even considered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much of that is on-set experimentation, and how much does she already have in her head, about which angles she wants and how she wants the final picture to look?\nIt can vary. Almost exactly 50 of one, 50 of the other. Obviously certain things are set. And it depends on our time restrictions, where we are. But then even that can go out the window. I remember us being in The Hague, and being there all day, doing take after take after take. It\u2019s really down to how she feels about it, whether she\u2019s into it or not on a given day.\nBecause of the way the show is edited, you sometimes have to play a single conversation over the course of months, in different cities. How do you maintain continuity or mood? Do you watch playback of yourself, or are there other technological aids?\n\u201cI just startle when I see myself on-screen.\u201d\nYou can have playback if you ask for it. I do remember certain things being played back for us. But I try not to watch anything I\u2019ve done on-screen, so I do my best to avoid that, unless there\u2019s a technical reason, where I have to literally see where I put a prop, or where I was sitting, and how. I just startle when I see myself on-screen. It\u2019s like the pictures your parents took of you when you were 12, and you can see yourself literally shrinking from the camera because you didn\u2019t want your picture taken. That\u2019s how I feel, seeing myself on camera.\nAbout maintaining continuity\u2026 whether it has to do with the bonding experiences we had in San Francisco before we started shooting the first season, or whether it\u2019s the nature of the work itself that you adapt to, I don\u2019t know, but it seems that we\u2019re able to slot in and support our cast members, regardless of where we are or how difficult the circumstances. That still seems to hold true, which I\u2019m proud of, actually.\nI\u2019ve read that of all the places you\u2019ve had to travel for the show, you were most excited about Chicago.\nYes, because I\u2019d never been there before. I was expecting \u2014 if you live in Los Angeles, or a coastal city, the Midwest has a reputation. But I felt totally at home there. It had a feel to it that was very attractive, but I can\u2019t put my finger on why! We were shooting on the South Side while all sorts of shit was going down over Labor Day weekend. I can\u2019t remember how many people were killed that weekend. And yet I felt okay. I don\u2019t know why that is. I can appreciate the Wachowskis\u2019 link with it, but I\u2019m from London. There\u2019s no particular reason why I should feel so at home there.\nYou\u2019ve spent so much of this series trying to play emotionally intense scenes while completely immobile, physically strapped to a table. How have you approached that?\nHard! It\u2019s hard! I guess the key there is to remember the reality of your physical situation, and think about what that situation might do to a person. I certainly can\u2019t be as animated as I might be. It\u2019s like having everything stripped away, so there\u2019s a kind of purity in that.\nAs season 2 dives deeper into the show\u2019s mythology, and we learn more about Jonas, is there anything you\u2019re particularly glad to have the audience see?\nThe scenes shot in San Francisco, the montage of his relationship with Daryl\u2019s character, Angel. That was very important, because there was a softness and an innocence to Jonas that perhaps wasn\u2019t immediately obvious. Also, I got to get off that table, to move and walk. [Laughs]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did they describe the character to you initially? What\u2019s really core to him as far as they\u2019re concerned? \nLana described him as similar to Laurence Fishburne\u2019s character in The Matrix. Not in an obvious way, but she saw him as a similar type. I remember Terrence describing being parachuted in for scenes \u2014 we bring exposition, we bring information to the tale, as it were. And there\u2019s a certain way of doing that so it doesn\u2019t sound obvious. If a character\u2019s suddenly spouting information that\u2019s supposed to bring you up to date, it can seem artificial or contrived. \nWhat was important to you about Jonas, in terms of why you took this project?\nI wanted to be involved \u2014 and still do \u2014 in something that\u2019s totally unique, and is a direct \u201cfuck you\u201d to what seems to be happening all over the world now, in terms of fascism. This show is anti-fascist in the best sense. At the time I took the role, it hadn\u2019t happened here yet. That was unthinkable. But the unthinkable has happened here. And it was already happening in Europe. What\u2019s got worse is \u2014 at that time, it was largely Eastern Europe. Now it\u2019s India as well. This show is just a way of having a voice against all that noise.\nWhat does the show say to you about freedom in the face of fascism?\nThat it\u2019s imperative to preserve it. It\u2019s imperative to fight, I think. Even when the obstacles seem insurmountable, they\u2019re not. Fascists are fallible, too.\n"}
