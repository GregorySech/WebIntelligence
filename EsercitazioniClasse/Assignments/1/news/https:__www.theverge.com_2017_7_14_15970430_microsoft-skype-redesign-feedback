{"title": "Everyone seems to hate the new Skype", "content": " \nMicrosoft\u2019s radical redesign of Skype isn\u2019t going down well. While Android users have had access to the new Skype design for a month, the refresh only debuted on iPhone a couple of weeks ago. Ratings of the Skype app on Apple\u2019s App Store have plummeted worldwide since the new Skype launched. In the UK App Store Skype is now rated at just 1 star, while ratings have fallen from 3.5 stars in the US to just 1.5 stars. The same is happening across European App Store ratings for Skype, and the feedback appears to be very similar.\n\u201cThis latest update is the most thrown-together looking thing I've seen in a long time,\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cThe layout looks and feels nothing like Skype, the chat system is a mess and the Highlights system just screams \u2018we want to be as successful as SnapChat.\u2019\u201d Other reviews take a similar tone, with many suggesting this is the \u201cworst Skype update ever.\u201d Even in the Google Play Store, where an overall rating is applied regardless of versions, Microsoft\u2019s Skype rating is starting to slip thanks to many 1 star ratings in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Skype\n\n\nThe reaction could be similar to Facebook newsfeed changes\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss these as the usual push back from a radical redesign, and Facebook suffers the same reactions every time it changes its newsfeed. However, Skype has been through a number of design changes over the years and the app was already hovering around just 3 stars in the App Store ahead of the big changes introduced last month. People weren\u2019t necessarily happy with Skype before, but this update has triggered a visceral reaction to change.\nMicrosoft has radically redesigned Skype this time to focus more on messaging, and it has changed what people are used to with Skype. Instead of fixing the many issues around Skype\u2019s notification and sync unreliability, Microsoft has painted over the obvious problems with new features that let you use emoji in video calls and a Highlight option that\u2019s very similar to Snapchat.\nOther popular messaging services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have largely stuck to the basics without overhauling their design constantly. WhatsApp\u2019s success comes from its simplicity and ability to use an adaptive design on each platform to match the default messaging experience that you\u2019re used to. Microsoft has tried something new with Skype, and it\u2019s now listening to the painful feedback. Microsoft will now have to either walk things back to simplicity, or push on and hope that Skype users accept these big changes and don\u2019t go looking elsewhere.\n"}
