{"title": "Honda made a very cute self-driving cooler", "content": " Tech and coolers don\u2019t always mix, as evidenced by the fiasco surrounding the successful-then-disastrous Coolest Cooler Kickstarter campaign. Honda is all out to change that at this year\u2019s Tokyo Motor Show, however: behold the Honda RoboCas Concept. What is the Honda RoboCas Concept? Well. Honda calls it a \u201ca unique form of electric mobility\u201d that was \u201cborn to make each person\u2019s ideas and dreams come true.\u201d Its \u201cuse is limited only by the imagination.\u201d Or in other words, it\u2019s a self-driving cooler with LED eyes. The RoboCas design is clearly of a piece with the Sports EV concept car that Honda also unveiled at the show this year. Honda imagines people using it to open cafes or curry shops wherever they may roam. RoboCas \u201ccan follow people in its unique, cute way, bringing happiness and joy to everyone,\u201d the company says. There\u2019s also a Windows tablet stuck on the back, if that helps.At Honda's Tokyo Motor Show booth, though, RoboCas pretty much just sat there and blinked at me. Oh well. I still love the idea, and hope that Honda\u2019s concept becomes a reality someday."}
