{"title": "Instagram is pushing restaurants to be kitschy, colorful, and irresistible to photographers", "content": " \nWhen it came time to design their first restaurant, Media Noche, San Francisco entrepreneurs Madelyn Markoe and Jessie Barker found themselves lacking inspiration. Their designer had asked them for ideas and they felt like \u201cdeer in headlights.\u201d Ultimately, Markoe says, they came up with a single instruction: \u201cWe wanted to be Instagrammable.\u201d\nFor years now, Instagram has sat at the center of trends in food and beverages. Rainbow-colored \u201cunicorn foods\u201d are often designed with Instagram in mind, and entrepreneurs responsible for popular treats like the galaxy donut and Sugar Factory milkshake often see lines around the block after images of their products go viral. Firms like Paperwhite Studio specialize in turning restaurants into Instagram bait by designing twee sugar packets, menus, and coasters bearing slogans like \u201chello, my sweet\u201d and \u201chug more.\u201d \nNow some entrepreneurs are taking the idea a step further, designing their physical spaces in the hopes of inspiring the maximum number of photos. They\u2019re commissioning neon signs bearing modestly sly double entendres, painting elaborate murals of tropical wildlife, and embedding floor tiles with branded greetings \u2014 all in the hopes that their guests will post them.\nInstagram triggers include banana-print wallpaper in the bathrooms and an exterior mural of pink flamingos\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you know millennials are starting to open restaurants,\u201d says Hannah Collins, the San Francisco designer charged with bringing Media Noche to life. Collins\u2019 firm has been responsible for some of the city\u2019s most Instagram-friendly designs in recent years, including Roman-style pizzeria Delarosa (featuring striking pendant lights), airy pasta bar Barzotto (bathroom wallpaper that recalls an Italian village), and local burger chain Super Duper (bright-white interiors punctuated with neon).\nTo be sure, restaurateurs have always wanted their spaces to look attractive. But in the era before social media, a designer could concern herself primarily with the space\u2019s effect on its occupants. How a room looked in photographs was, at best, a secondary concern. Ravi DeRossi, owner and primary designer of 16 bars and restaurants, including the pioneering New York craft cocktail bar Death & Company, says he has never used Instagram, preferring to design by instinct. \u201cI want my places to feel transportive,\u201d he says. Death & Company, which opened in 2007, exemplifies design in the pre-Instagram age: dark wood, dim lighting, and a muted color palette. The bar has a sophisticated interior, but it\u2019s kryptonite for Instagram \u2014 good luck getting any likes on that underexposed shot of your $16 Dixieland Julep.\nWhen the older generation of restaurants were designed as visual experiences, they generally came across as kitsch: think of the mid-century hot dog stands and donut shops shaped as the food they served. Those made for good photographs, too, but their primary aim was to entice drivers to pull off the highway and eat there.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a pivot and swing,\u201d says Eddy Buckingham, co-owner of The Good Sort, a vegan tea and coffee shop in New York\u2019s Chinatown district. The Good Sort is Buckingham\u2019s third restaurant, but his first to offer Instagram-friendly rainbow lattes and pastel-pink coffee cups. \u201cEven predating social media, you\u2019d see the places that were thoughtful about their aesthetic, cohesive in their brand identity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t invented simultaneously with the explosion of Instagram. Good operators did that previously. I just think it\u2019s more important than ever.\u201d\nMedia Noche\u2019s Collins first remembers Instagram entering the conversation in San Francisco several years ago, when someone working on the marketing for a new restaurant asked how it would photograph. At the time, a design\u2019s social media potential was far from her mind. \u201cI\u2019m a tech degenerate. I was pretty against Instagram in the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then eventually you\u2019re like, I give in. Now it\u2019s one of the first questions we ask clients \u2014 what\u2019s going to be your hook?\u201d \nFor Media Noche, a fast-casual Cuban restaurant in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, the hook was the floor. Searching through old Cuban designs, Collins found beautiful old tiles with a dramatic pink-and-green floral designs. She had similar tiles custom-made for the restaurant, and they provided a visual anchor for everything that followed. Other Instagram triggers include banana-print wallpaper in the bathrooms, an old-fashioned white board menu with removable black plastic letters, and an exterior mural of pink flamingos, their heads bowed into the shape of a heart.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it opened in March, Media Noche was an immediate social media magnet, drawing visits from a small army of San Francisco\u2019s Instagram influencers, who promoted the restaurant to tens of thousands of followers. And while Media Noche\u2019s food gets plenty of attention from Instagram users, it\u2019s the physical space that seems to inspire most of the geotagged posts. Since June 1st, guests have posted 19 shots of the banana-wallpapered bathroom, 36 of their feet artfully contrasted with the signature tile, and 131 photos posing in front of the flamingo mural.\nMarkoe says that the restaurant\u2019s early social media success has attracted tourists from as far away as China and Japan. \u201cThey saw the photos and they say, \u2018I want that for my Instagram,\u2019\u201d she says. The average guest takes pictures for 10 minutes before ordering anything, Markoe says. Many bring tripods to better frame their shots. \u201cIt\u2019s just really insane,\u201d she says.\nThe average guest takes pictures for 10 minutes before ordering, and many bring tripods to better frame their shots\nFor many restaurants, Instagram-centered design means moving to physical spaces that are flooded with natural light, so as to permit more beautiful photographs. Markoe and Barker chose the location for Media Noche in part because of how much sunshine it let in. \nCafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach, California, had been in Sylvie Gabriele\u2019s family for 37 years when they decided to start over. As a French restaurant, the space had been dark and intimate. But in 2014, the family reimagined the business as a California-Italian restaurant with an open kitchen and much brighter lighting. \u201cThe lighting was super important,\u201d Gabriele says of the redesigned restaurant, which the family named Love & Salt. \u201cWe wanted people to really feel that they had that openness, and that lightness, that we\u2019re all living in. We had thoughts of, this will be a great Instagram moment.\u201d (Designer Ana Henton contributed another Instagram moment: a three-dimensional sign reading \u201cLOVE\u201d in an enormous font, the letters filled in with salt shakers.) \nInstagram can even dictate which sorts of bars and restaurants are built. Last year, a friend told me she suspected that Instagram was behind the resurgence of tiki bars in New York City. We were drinking boozy red slushies out of ceramic shark heads at an East Village joint named Mother of Pearl. The server set them down in front of us and then bloodied their mouths with red food coloring. (The drink, the Shark Eye, would go on to be named the Most Instagram-Worthy Cocktail of 2016 by Time Out New York.)\n\u201cWe wanted people to really feel that they had that openness, and that lightness, that we\u2019re all living in.\u201d \nWith their campy decor and over-the-top cocktails, few establishments more reliably produce the kind of aspirational lifestyle content Instagram runs on than tiki bars. And they really are growing more popular: the number of self-identified tiki bars in New York City rose from four to nine last year, and foot traffic was up 21 percent, according to data from Foursquare. \nDeRossi, who owns Mother of Pearl, insisted he had never considered social media in designing the space \u2014 or the cocktail program, which he built with a collaborator named Jane Danger. And yet within months, he says, people were walking into the bar and, without even glancing at the menu, ordering the Shark Eye. They saw it on Instagram, they told the bartenders. \u201cI would imagine it\u2019s had a pretty large effect on the business,\u201d DeRossi says.\nSan Francisco entrepreneur Jen Pelka decided to open a champagne bar, The Riddler, in part because the concept seemed likely to inspire many celebratory Instagram posts. \u201cThe restaurants that I see that are the most successful, specifically in San Francisco but I think overall, are really concept-driven,\u201d says Pelka, who also runs a public relations agency and advises restaurants on social media strategy, \u201ca place that has a very specific point of view.\u201d\nEverything at The Riddler is designed around shareability, including the exterior of the building, on which Pelka commissioned a mural of an upside-down champagne bottle with its cork just popped. (Geotagged Instagram posts featuring the mural since June 1st: 20. People reliably pose with the cork appearing to fly at their heads.) A sign out front reading simply \u201cchampagne bar\u201d advertises the vibe, as do serving dishes that bear the friendly slogan \u201cHello, old friend.\u201d (The slogan has appeared in 51 Instagram posts since June 1st.) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly everyone in photos posted from The Riddler looks as if they are having the time of their life. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better advertising campaign; indeed, most of the photos on The Riddler\u2019s own Instagram account were first posted by customers. \nThe menu helps guests along with a \u201cchambong\u201d \u2014 a beer bong, but for champagne, that doubles as a powerful conduit for Instagram likes. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible for a guest to order one and someone not to post about it on social media,\u201d Pelka says. I went to The Riddler for a friend\u2019s birthday party, and he declined the chance to swill ros\u00e9 through a V-shaped glass tube. But the object is featured regularly in posts about The Riddler, and its own Instagram account has more than 4,300 followers.\nFew restaurants have taken photo-friendliness as seriously as Bellota, a Spanish restaurant that opened in San Francisco last year. The entryway is enclosed, creating a pleasing shadowbox effect as you look into the dining room. The kitchen is open, and encourages patrons to take 360-degree videos of the space. Many Instagram posts feature pictures of \u201cthe ham wall,\u201d which is just what it sounds like: a window that looks into the temperature-controlled room where Bellota stores $50,000 worth of Spanish jamon ib\u00e9rico.\nThe most striking thing about Bellota may be the custom lamps at its 25-seat bar, which let patrons adjust the lighting in order to get the perfect shot. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most avid Instagram user of the group, so I kept bringing it up,\u201d says Ryan McIlwraith, Bellota\u2019s chef. He wanted the lighting to do justice to the restaurant\u2019s tapas plates and signature paellas. \u201cIt turned out these lamps we got were just perfect for it,\u201d he says. The lamps can be tilted or turned 180 degrees, and the light\u2019s intensity can be adjusted up and down. An \u201cadvanced feature\u201d allows patrons to rest their phones on the lamp\u2019s neck so as to take a selfie. (I did, and must admit the lighting was lovely.)\n\u201cWe literally think about framing our photographs, and how we can capture the essence of our experience within the square frame of Instagram specifically.\u201d\nFor entrepreneurs seeking social media glory, no detail is too small to consider. The Turk\u2019s Inn, a $3 million labor of love due to open in Bushwick, New York, early next year, represents an elaborate effort to re-create a beloved northern Wisconsin supper club. A standard American midcentury steak and chop house with a vaguely East Asian inspiration, the original Turk\u2019s Inn had walls full of kitsch \u2014 live peacocks patrolled the grounds. When it closed in 2013 following the death of its owner, entrepreneur Varun Kataria and his best friend purchased as many of its relics as they could and set about bringing the concept to New York.\nKataria says Instagram is never far from his mind. He stalks his space like an old-time movie director, making Ls with his fingers to frame each corner in his mind. \u201cWe literally think about framing our photographs, and how we can capture the essence of our experience within the square frame of Instagram specifically,\u201d Kataria says. The physical space is a standard square, but Kataria and his partners have carved it up with little walls to make nooks and other hidden corners. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for Instagram,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it lends itself really well to a lot of eclectic photographs.\u201d \nWhat, in the end, do entrepreneurs get in return for their social media savvy? Nobody I spoke to had determined an exact return on their investment. At four months old, Media Noche\u2019s success is gauged primarily in how many foreign tourists come in each week. The Riddler has experimented with Instagram-only promotions, and \u201ca huge percentage\u201d of guests will mention it when they come in, according to co-owner Pelka. \nRestaurateur Mark Barak, who owns La Pecora Bianca in New York City, said Instagram is useful primarily as a marketing channel. The restaurant accrues followers over time, and it posts every day in an effort to lure those followers back in. \u201cThe way Instagram is important for us is it helps us stay top of mind,\u201d Barak says. When The Riddler goes a few days without a post, Pelka says, the decline in business is noticeable.\nEven when bars and restaurants find their Instagram hook, they may find that it is swiftly copied. The Bay Area surge in message signs is often attributed to Mr. Holmes Bakehouse, a bakery that is home to a prominent message reading \u201cI got baked in San Francisco,\u201d scrawled on the wall in red neon. Now similar neon signs are everywhere, blunting their impact. Similarly, San Francisco\u2019s Hawaiian-themed Liholiho Yacht Club scored an Instagram hit with its floor tile, which spells out the word \u201cAloha\u201d \u2014 only to inspire copycats across the city. Some imitators are more transparent than others: the floor of Le Marais, a new French bakery in the Castro, reads \u201cBonjour.\u201d\n\u201cI think people can feel when it\u2019s a bit thirsty.\u201d \nFor entrepreneurs, the risk is that their Instagram-driven designs will begin to look stale or inauthentic. \u201cSome things feel like they were cooked up in a social media lab,\u201d says The Good Sort\u2019s Buckingham. \u201cI think people can feel when it\u2019s a bit thirsty.\u201d Shortly after I spoke to Buckingham, a neighborhood in Brooklyn saw the arrival of a \u201cboozy sandwich shop\u201d named Summerhill; its owner promoted the Instagrammability of its \u201cbullet hole-ridden wall.\u201d The owner later admitted that the holes were not created by bullets, though somehow I don\u2019t think the influencers will mind.\nUltimately, restaurants are in the business of making memories, the Old Turk\u2019s Kataria says \u2014 and photos are the place where we store them. On Instagram, \u201cwe basically trade memories of commodities,\u201d he says, showing off the places we\u2019ve been like so many collected pok\u00e9mon. Restaurants supply the raw material, and we come in to collect it with a smartphone lens. Kataria is sanguine. \u201cWe know that ultimately that\u2019s the game that we\u2019re playing.\u201d \nBefore I visited Media Noche, I perused photos of the restaurant on Instagram. Individually, many of the posts are charming. Taken together, there\u2019s an unsettling sameness to them. Triggered by hyper-specific features, diners were taking the same five photos over and over. \nI was one of them. Waiting for my food there last week, I dutifully took a shot of my feet against the tile. Despite having seen so many feet in those photos, I was still somehow curious how my own shoes would look. As I waited for my pollo bowl, I saw that a friend of mine had been to Media Noche just a few hours earlier \u2014 and posted an identical shot to his story.\n"}
