{"title": "Spotify is testing a driving mode feature", "content": " \nSpotify is testing a new Driving Mode feature, according to some users who have posted on Reddit. A few users have been given access to a new feature that allows them to enable a driving mode which enlarges buttons, announces songs, and features voice controls (which aren\u2019t active yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Chris54721\n\n\nPhotos posted by Reddit user Chris54721 show the new user interface, which features a car emblem in the bottom right corner of the now playing window, allowing users to enable the driving mode. Doing so enlarges the forward and backward buttons, and adds a microphone which theoretically would allow you to ask for songs to be played. Spotify can also announce the next song so you don\u2019t have to look down to check the title.\nWhether this Driving Mode will end up as an official product is still up in the air. Spotify tests a ton of different features all the time that end up on a small number of user devices \u2014 this was meant for Spotify employees but somehow got on public devices, according to the screenshots \u2014 but then don\u2019t expand to a wider audience. It\u2019s likely that Spotify will eventually come out with a Driving Mode, given how many people use it while driving, but when that will happen is unknown. For now all we have is a small test.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Spotify for comment. \n"}
