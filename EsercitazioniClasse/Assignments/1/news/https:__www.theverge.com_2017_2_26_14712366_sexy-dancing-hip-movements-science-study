{"title": "Most dancing is sexy \u2014 as long as you bother to get on the floor", "content": " \nMy closest friends know that I love dancing. They also know I dance crazy: I like jumping up and down, jiggling my legs as if I\u2019m having a seizure, and spreading my arms wide in a dance move I call \u201cthe bird.\u201d Mainly, I do all these things because I have fun dancing this way. And if I\u2019m out on a dance floor, I want to have fun. \nEarlier this month I saw a scientific study that made me really mad. It was about female dance moves that are considered sexy, at least according to \u201cscience.\u201d Several respectable news outlets like The New York Times and Scientific American reported on the study, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports.\nThere are a few things I hate about this study. First of all, it\u2019s the way it was designed. Researchers at Northumbria University in the UK asked 39 young women, ages 18 to 30, to dance to a drum beat taken from a Robbie Williams song. They then used motion-capture technology to record the dancers and render their movements onto a computer avatar. That was done to remove \u201call information about their individual appearance,\u201d the study says. In other words, they didn\u2019t want men and women judging the dance moves to focus on the dancers\u2019 looks. The problem is, the avatar they came up with is an over-sexualized woman with impossible body proportions. I mean, look at that tiny waist and big breasts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthumbria University\n\n\nThe researchers then asked 200 people \u2014 57 men and 143 women \u2014 to watch the avatars dance for 15 seconds and rate them from extremely bad to extremely good. Here\u2019s what contributes to \u201chigh-quality female dance,\u201d according to the study: big hip swing, and your arms and thighs moving independently of one another. The researchers provide a few reasons why these movements might make for hot dancing: swaying your hips is a sign of femininity, and it might signal your fertility to a potential partner. Moving your limbs in an asymmetric way is also a sign of finely tuned motor skills. Those are all things we expect men to want from us, right?\nWell, I don\u2019t dance like this. Before writing this article, I asked my boyfriend \u2014 who\u2019s a big fan of my dancing \u2014 what he likes about the way I bop around the dance floor. \u201cI love how much fun you have, and how wild you are,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt always makes me smile.\u201d Is it possible the science is wrong?\nAs I suspected, the study has some big limitations \u2014 and its explanations may be more of a \u201cjust-so\u201d story than science. The dancers were all heterosexual female college students, rated by all heterosexual men and women. So the study doesn\u2019t speak for people who identify with any other sexual orientation. All those women were also recruited from a university in northeastern England, and we know that dance and sexiness are cultural. So while this study might tell us something about hot dancing in the UK, it\u2019s not some kind of universal statement on sexy dance worldwide.\nany dancing performed with conviction is sexy\nThe study also comprises of only 39 dancers \u2014 that\u2019s not a lot of people, and as Slate columnist Daniel Engber points out, that means the findings might not be definitive at all. In fact, the same Northumbria University researchers published a similar study in 2010 analyzing male dancing. That study, published in Biology Letters, showed that twisting your right knee real fast would make a man a sexy dancer. That was a pretty weird finding, and a follow-up study in 2013 failed to replicate the result. The lead researcher told Engber that was because the first study only had 19 subjects; to answer certain research questions, he would need to study at least 200 subjects. So why did the study on female dancers only include 39? \nThe clips rated for dance quality in the Scientific Reports study were also super short: 15 seconds. That\u2019s a pretty short time frame to judge whether someone is a good dancer \u2014 aka a good partner you\u2019d choose for mating. And do we want to even talk about how scary-looking that avatar is? It gives me nightmares.\nPersonally, I believe that any dancing performed with conviction is sexy. Take the topical dance scene in the movie Hitch. Will Smith asks Kevin James to show him how he dances \u2014 and off James goes, starting the fire and making the pizza, using the Q-tip at the sound of \u201cYeah!\u201d by Usher feat. Lil Jon. You might disagree with me, and I will disagree with Will Smith. That dancing is sexy to me \u2014 because he\u2019s so sure of himself and he\u2019s having fun. Or, in James\u2019 words in the movie, \u201cJust expressing myself.\u201d\n\nWhen I first moved to New York, a friend of mine was trying to teach me how to sway my hips to the rhythm of hip hop music. I\u2019d never danced to hip hop in Italy, which is where I\u2019m originally from, and I sucked at this new style of dance. I felt like a piece of wood trying to move smoothly and \u2014 worse \u2014 I was consumed by self-consciousness. I quickly decided to give up the sensual hip waving to go back to the crazy dancing style I had mastered in high school. I was self-confident again, and dancing was again fun. And isn\u2019t having fun the real point of dance? \nSo please ignore the headlines that scream, \u201cWhat Makes a Woman a Good Dancer? Watch the Hips, a Study Says\u201d and \u201cWhat Makes for the Hottest Dance Moves? Hips Don't Lie.\u201d You know what makes a woman a sexy dancer? A woman who\u2019s having fun. \n\n"}
