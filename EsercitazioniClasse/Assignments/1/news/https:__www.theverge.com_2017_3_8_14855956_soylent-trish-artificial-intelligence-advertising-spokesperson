{"title": "Soylent is getting an AI spokesperson, because it wasn\u2019t dystopian enough already", "content": " \nSoylent, the food replacement substance that shares a name with a 1973 movie about cannibalism, will now be advertised by a fictional AI spokeswoman who also runs a store on the dark web. Trish, as the void-faced silver box is known, is \u201ca nutrition-obsessed artificially intelligent spokesperson\u201d who will \u201ceducate people on how to use a range of products\u201d and \u201chelp make food decisions easier and stress-free.\u201d She\u2019s the joint product of Soylent and advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, and will appear in marketing materials. Her dark web store, Soy Route, sells exclusive products like a mystery-flavor Soylent, a beef-flavor kit, a Soylent pin pack, a Soylent Drink multipack, and \u201cgolden Soylent\u201d signed by CEO Rob Rhinehart.\nAd Age says that Soylent is not technically named after the film Soylent Green, in which a mystery food turns out to be processed human meat. It draws from the book that film is based on, where \u201csoylent\u201d is a mundane combination of soy and lentils. That didn\u2019t stop one of my coworkers from once publicly betting that the product was a viral marketing campaign for a Soylent Green remake, because let\u2019s be honest, the only thing most people remember about either story is Charlton Heston yelling \u201cSoylent Green is people!\u201d The point is, Soylent is already a ridiculously sinister-sounding company, even when it\u2019s not literally making people sick.\nBut not sinister enough, apparently. Because some executive pounded their fist on a boardroom table and declared, no, we need more science fiction nightmare tropes, and now here I am gazing into the glowing vacuum of Trish\u2019s thousand-yard stare. \u201cHello. I am Trish. An artificial intelligence created by Soylent. I am here to help,\u201d she says. Trish will be showcased at SXSW this weekend. I assume that if I visit her and try to look away, she\u2019ll scrunch up her eyes in this peculiar expression that\u2019s equal parts laughter and menace. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Adi,\u201d she\u2019ll say. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the Ludovico brand activation booth boots up, and Soylent\u2019s patented aversion therapy cures me of my desire for regular food forever, before Rob Rhinehart announces the new Soylent-sponsored rollerball league. Somewhere, the executive finishes a Planet of the Apes marathon. Hey Trish, they say to their virtual assistant. How much Soylent would it take to literally bury the Statue of Liberty?\n"}
