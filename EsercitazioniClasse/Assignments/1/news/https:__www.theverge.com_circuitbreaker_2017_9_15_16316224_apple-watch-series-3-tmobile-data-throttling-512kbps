{"title": "The Apple Watch will be throttled to 3G data speeds on T-Mobile\u2019s network", "content": " \nT-Mobile will limit data speeds on the Apple Watch Series 3 to a maximum of 512kbps despite the smartwatch\u2019s support for LTE connectivity, a spokesperson has confirmed to The Verge. As MacRumors noticed earlier today, the throttled speeds are mentioned on the carrier\u2019s website. Apple isn\u2019t yet advising customers of T-Mobile\u2019s capped data performance. The 512kbps limit is also applied to smartwatches from other companies such as Samsung.\n\u201cCustomers can do everything they want to do with the watch at 512kbps,\u201d a T-Mobile spokesperson said by email. \u201cIf customers feel they need high-speed data, they can choose high-speed data with paired DIGITS for $20 with auto-pay.\u201d If auto-pay is not enabled for your plan, the cost is $25.\nThe standard fee that US carriers are charging to add the Apple Watch to your existing plan \u2014 so it can share your iPhone\u2019s phone number \u2014 is $10 per month. Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and Sprint have not given any indication that they will limit the smartwatch\u2019s download speeds. T-Mobile, on the other hand, is saying you\u2019ll have to spend at least double the usual rate to unlock the Apple Watch Series 3\u2019s full data speed capabilities.\nIt\u2019s unclear why T-Mobile sees fit to slow down Apple\u2019s smartwatch, which is unlikely to be much of a burden on the company\u2019s network. At launch, Apple Watch Series 3 will support calls and texting over cellular connections, and third-party apps can also access data. Next month, Apple plans to release an update that will add support for streaming Apple Music directly from the Apple Watch. 512kbps should be enough to allow music streaming (Apple Music\u2019s top bitrate is 256kbps), but it\u2019s still very bizarre to me that T-Mobile \u2014 the company that constantly says its network is \u201cbuilt for unlimited\u201d \u2014 has decided to put a ceiling in place at all. \n"}
