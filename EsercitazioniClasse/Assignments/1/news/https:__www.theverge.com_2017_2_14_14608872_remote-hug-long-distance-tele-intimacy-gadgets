{"title": "Feeling lonely this Valentine\u2019s Day? Try a remote hug", "content": " \nTechnology has given us lots of ways to connect with distant romantic partners, friends, and family. You can send a text message, make a phone call, or launch a video chat, among many other options. Overwhelmingly, these focus on only two of our senses: sight and hearing. But what if you could reach out and physically touch someone who was thousands of miles away? This is the driving question behind a bevy of devices that are supposed to physically connect people with a simple, universal gesture: the hug.\nThere are as many ways to remotely hug someone as there are variations of real-world hugs. There\u2019s the MIT Media Lab\u2019s Like-a-Hug, for example, which translates Facebook likes into an inflatable squeeze vest. There\u2019s the FeelU RingU, which sends vibrations via a connected ring. If you don\u2019t want to bother with special equipment, you could even hug your phone to transmit a \u201cphysical emoji,\u201d with the iOS app Hug. None of them are supposed to substitute for a real embrace, but if you\u2019re stuck in a different city, country, or continent, they\u2019re the next best thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuteCircuit Hug Shirt.\nPhoto: CuteCircuit\n\n\nPhysical touch from other human beings, including hugging, has known psychological and physical benefits. Studies have tied it to a reduction of the stress-related hormone cortisol, improved mental and physical development in children, and even a stronger immune system. Touch also stimulates the release of oxytocin, a hormone that plays a complex role in social bonding. (It\u2019s often oversimplified as the \u201clove hormone,\u201d although its real effects are far more varied and less predictable.)\nBut less work has been done specifically on remote touch \u2014 forms of intimacy that come from another person, but are delivered via machine. The best-known hugging devices tend to be either experimental proofs of concept, or startup projects whose creators are focused on getting them out the door. \u201cNew devices are quickly developed and built, but tend not to be put through any kind of rigorous empirical testing,\u201d concluded researchers Alberto Gallace and Charles Spence, who covered the state of long-distance touch devices in their 2014 book In Touch with the Future.\nThere are lots of remote hugging devices, but less empirical research\nSometimes, that\u2019s because an inventor was originally inspired by individual experience. Parihug, one of the newest hugging devices, started out as a hackathon project with very personal relevance to its creators. \u201cEveryone on our team was, when they joined the team, in a long-distance relationship,\u201d recalls CEO and founder Xyla Foxlin. \u201cAnd so we designed it to [the specifications] we thought we needed at that time.\u201d That turned out to be a pair of stuffed animals called Paris, each of which is equipped with sensors and motors. When one person hugs their Pari, their partner feels a matching vibration on the other. The group worked with the psychology department at Case Western Reserve University (Foxlin\u2019s alma mater) to do preliminary testing in elementary schools. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done any long-term in-house testing so far,\u201d she says. But it\u2019s gotten a positive response in schools and at tech shows, including last month\u2019s CES.\nSimilar projects, though, have proved ephemeral. The Hug \u201cphysical emoji\u201d app, for example, was last updated in May of 2016; its creators didn\u2019t respond to an email. Neither did the company behind the Hug Shirt, a two-way vibrating shirt system by high-tech fashion company CuteCircuit. It got a spot on Time\u2019s \u201cbest inventions of the year\u201d in 2006, but doesn\u2019t appear to be for sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugvie body pillow.\nPhoto: DigInfo\n\n\nThere is, however, some scientific evidence supporting the remote hug. A 2013 study in Scientific Reports asked two groups of people to have a 15-minute phone call with a stranger. Some people talked normally, while the others held a Hugvie, an abstract human-shaped cushion designed to fit a mobile phone in the \u201chead\u201d and simulate a heartbeat based on the speaker\u2019s tone of voice. The ones who hugged while they talked saw greater decreases in cortisol, suggesting that the cushion had provided some of the same stress-relieving benefits as touch. (Granted, this doesn\u2019t tell us how much the connection with a real person \u2014 as opposed to simply hugging a pillow \u2014 helped.)\nBasic hug machines are already real therapeutic tools\nMechanical hugging devices, with or without a human connection, can also have more specific uses. Wei Liang Lin, CEO of a Singaporean company called Tware, says his team started out by building an inflatable jacket for remote touch. Then, an occupational therapist told them that its firm squeeze could also help kids with autism. The jacket could deliver a kind of therapy pioneered by animal science professor Temple Grandin, who created a \u201csqueeze box\u201d in the 1960s to help with her own autism-related anxiety. Ironically, the point of Grandin\u2019s box was that it wasn\u2019t like a human embrace \u2014 users could experience the comforting pressure of a hug without the overstimulation of being touched by people. Tware shifted focus, working on a device aimed specifically at therapy for people dealing with autism, ADHD, and other conditions whose negative effects can be ameliorated by deep pressure. The resulting T-Jacket, which sells for $599, has been praised by Grandin herself.\nToday, the T-Jacket\u2019s creators are slowly moving back toward their original idea. Their second project, AiraWear, is a mass-market jacket that can analyze posture and give massages. Right now, it\u2019s controlled by the wearer via an app. But in a future version, Lin says, you could accept a virtual massage from a loved one \u2014 and maybe a hug, too.\nHugging devices sometimes get grouped under the label of \u201cteledildonics,\u201d a catch-all term for remote sex technology. But they might be more accurately called tele-intimacy products, facilitating basic human contact of all kinds. And in some ways, this makes them more potentially revolutionary. Basic physical contact doesn\u2019t need to be limited to lovers; it\u2019s a way to bond with everyone in our lives \u2014 Parihug is setting its sights on traveling parents with children at home, but Foxlin says they\u2019ve gotten requests from all kinds of people. Most of us wouldn\u2019t leave a sex toy out in plain sight, but a hug is something you can openly enjoy in both public and private environments, with as many people as you want. It could even add a more personal touch to internet-only friendships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Jacket therapeutic pressurized vest.\nPhoto: Tware\n\n\nBasic tele-intimacy devices also don\u2019t need to simulate a specific kind of sensation, just evoke a feeling. \u201cI don\u2019t think technology is at the point where we can create anything that will fool the brain into believing they\u2019re having sex,\u201d says Foxlin, although she believes we\u2019ll develop it in the future. Parihug is designed to avoid what she calls the uncanny valley of touch. \u201cWe don\u2019t have artificial muscles that can mimic a human. We can\u2019t really create the body temperature of a human, or the same texture or feeling of a human. But what we can do is dial that back a lot, so it [enters] the cute realm. If it\u2019s simplified enough, then we receive things as cute but still human.\u201d\nWhether or not this is true, the remote hug is still a novelty, not a core part of people\u2019s communications. Many of the hug systems that have gotten press coverage were never meant for consumers, and others, like Parihug, are just starting to roll out. Some systems got lots of attention, but not much funding: the vibrating vibrating Teslasuit, for example, canceled its Kickstarter campaign after raising a little over 10 percent of its goal. While the Hug app shows how tele-intimacy could work with no extra accessories, most systems require costly and sometimes strange-looking peripherals, like the currently $172 Hugvie body pillow. Practical issues aside, some systems don\u2019t seem reciprocal enough to be satisfying; you can either give a hug convincingly or receive one, but often not both. And right now, digital touch can\u2019t deliver the detail and nuance of its real-life counterpart.\nIf enough of our relationships involve drifting apart physically, maybe simulated touch will become a necessary tool. \u201cLong distance commuting is becoming something of a norm, so everyone is kind of separated,\u201d says Lin. \u201cRemote communication is going to be something that is needed \u2014 that is necessary in people\u2019s way of life.\u201d Until then, you could always look up a cuddle cafe.\nCorrection: The T-Jacket sells for $599, not $499 as previously stated.\n"}
