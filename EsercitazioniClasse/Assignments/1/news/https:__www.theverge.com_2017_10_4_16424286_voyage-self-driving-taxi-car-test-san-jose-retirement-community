{"title": "Self-driving taxis are coming to residential neighborhoods", "content": " \nMost experts agree that robot cars will first roll out as fleets of self-driving taxis in controlled environments \u2014 college campuses, business parks, dedicated freeway lanes, or downtowns of congested cities. And we\u2019re already starting to see the first hints of those types of services. A new one called Voyage just launched in a retirement community in California today. \nTwo self-driving Ford Fusions (with a third on the way) will offer trips to the 4,000 residents of the Villages, a gated community for senior citizens in San Jose. There are 15 miles of roads within the community for Voyage\u2019s self-driving cars to learn how to interact with pedestrians, animals, roundabouts, and golf carts. The speed limit is only 25 mph, which helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. (The New York Times had a nice write-up about it today.)\nThe speed limit is only 25 mph\n\u201cWe looked for the perfect mixture of: passenger need and scale, complex and chaotic road, and a slight reduction in speed (which occurs as a result of golf carts sharing the road with lots of cars),\u201d Oliver Cameron, Voyage\u2019s 29-year-old CEO, told The Verge in an email. \u201cIt turns out that very few places fit this description, especially in the Bay Area. We got to know The Villages leadership, and we were lucky to get permission to deploy.\u201d\nGetting that permission was a bit of a bumpy ride, according to the Times. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of insurance coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more because it is a private community with increased liability. Eventually, the insurance broker that agreed to the policy did so on the contingency that Voyage share the data produced by its cars. \nVoyage is a spin-off from Udacity, an online learning service that offers courses in driverless technology. Cameron headed the startup\u2019s open source self-driving project before launching his own venture. Sebastian Thrun, Udacity\u2019s chairman and the founder of Google\u2019s self-driving car project, was briefly chairmen of Voyage before a conflict (he is also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, the hoverbike startup backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo) forced him to step down. \nVoyage is a spin-off from Udacity\nVoyage\u2019s self-driving taxi service isn\u2019t alone. Waymo is operating a limited service using its autonomous minivans in Arizona, and is rumored to be close to launching a broader, commercial ride-hailing operation before the end of the year. Uber is also offering trips in self-driving SUVs in Arizona, as well as Pittsburgh. And a variety of driverless shuttle services have been popping up on college campuses and business parks around the country. \nVoyage uses a fairly typical sensor suite to power its autonomous vehicles: A Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR, five Delphi radars, seven IDS cameras, and a gaming PC in the trunk with 2 GPUs. \nCameron says if the pilot service in the Villages goes well, he hopes to expand to a larger community \u2014 maybe even a whole city. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect first deployment, where we get to solve real problems for real people,\u201d he said.\n\n"}
