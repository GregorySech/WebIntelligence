{"title": "Hollywood studios join Disney to launch Movies Anywhere digital locker service", "content": " \nFor several years now, Disney has been the only Hollywood studio with a digital movie locker worth using, but a host of other industry heavyweights have now jumped on board to launch an expanded version of the service called Movies Anywhere. It\u2019s both a cloud-based digital locker and a one-stop-shop app: customers connect Movies Anywhere to their iTunes, Amazon Video, Google Play, or Vudu accounts, and all of the eligible movies they\u2019ve purchased through those retailers appear as part of their Movies Anywhere library. Given that the Movies Anywhere app works across a number of platforms, it basically allows them to take their digital film library with them no matter what device or operating system they\u2019re using.\nIt\u2019s quite similar to the functionality previously offered by Disney Movies Anywhere, which the company originally launched in 2014. That\u2019s because the new service is built upon the same digital rights system architecture, dubbed \u201cKeychest,\u201d that Disney developed for its original service. The big difference here is selection. Warner Bros., Universal, Sony Pictures, and Twentieth Century Fox have all signed on to Movies Anywhere. Along with Disney\u2019s films, that gives the service a launch library of more than 7,300 titles. According to Karin Gilford, general manager for Movies Anywhere, conversations have also been ongoing with studios like Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate, though as of yet they\u2019re not part of the initiative.\nThe merciful, final blow that puts an end to UltraViolet\nThe launch of Movies Anywhere should be the merciful, final blow that puts an end to UltraViolet, one of the entertainment industry\u2019s first attempts at putting together a comprehensive digital locker service. That service flailed due to a poor customer experience and lack of adoption on the part of big digital retailers like Apple. The team behind Movies Anywhere seems to have learned from UltraViolet\u2019s mistakes, however, as well as Disney\u2019s previous successes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most important components is simply the number of platforms supported. The promise of \u201cbuy once, watch anywhere\u201d only works if a customer\u2019s preferred device supports the service in question. The Movies Anywhere app will be available for iOS, Apple TV, Android, Android TV, Amazon Fire devices, and as part of Roku\u2019s offerings. It will also support Chromecast, and titles will also watchable through the service\u2019s standalone website. And while apps for competing services have usually been clunky or awkward, the brief demo we saw of the Movies Anywhere app looked sleek and well-designed. Purchases made from the Google Play store on one device showed up in the Movies Anywhere library of another nearly instantly, and on an Android tablet the app\u2019s interface called to mind the glossy look of Netflix\u2019s latest UI.\nAnother key here is obviously going to be the ability to purchase new movies. The Movies Anywhere app is clearly intended to be the place that consumers go to first on their devices in order to get maximum selection \u2014 but if people are forced to dive into another app to make a purchase, the result would be the same kind of fragmented experience consumers have already grown tired of. Instead, Movies Anywhere will let customers buy movies directly, using the customer\u2019s retailer of choice to complete the process. (Android users will have the ability to purchase from Google Play, Amazon, or Vudu; those with Apple devices will only be able to purchase from iTunes, unless they head to a browser to purchase from a competitor directly.)\nThe common-sense solution consumers should have had years ago\nConceptually, Movies Anywhere appears to be the common-sense solution consumers should have had years ago. Titles will be streamed \u2014 but they can be downloaded for offline viewing. There are playback and registered device limitations \u2014 but they\u2019re so generous it\u2019s unlikely audiences will ever bump up against them. Secondary accounts are supported \u2014 which can be locked down via ratings, so parents can hand off a tablet without worrying that their 8-year-old will watch Goodfellas instead of The Good Dinosaur. \nExecution can be a different matter, however, and that\u2019s where an initiative like Movies Anywhere will really end up charming consumers, or turning into another option that couldn\u2019t quite make it. There\u2019s certainly going to be plenty of incentive for consumers to give it a try. The service is offering two free movies when customers link their accounts to a digital retailer, with another three coming with a second linked account. And Movies Anywhere will also be offering comprehensive support for redemption codes, so any Blu-rays or DVDs that come with codes for UltraViolet or Disney Movies Anywhere copies will also work with the new service. Hollywood has not always been quick to understand what consumers actually want or need when it comes to digital movie purchases, but it looks like Movies Anywhere is the best attempt yet. Those interested in trying it out for themselves can sign up now at the Movies Anywhere site.\n"}
