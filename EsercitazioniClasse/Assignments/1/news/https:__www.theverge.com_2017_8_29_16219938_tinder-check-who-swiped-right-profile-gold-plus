{"title": "Tinder Gold, which lets you pay to see who swiped right on you, arrives in the US", "content": " \nTinder Gold, a paid tier of the dating app, is coming to the US after months of testing in limited markets including Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico, and Germany. In the US, the paid subscription will be available for select iOS users starting today. Tinder claims its paid service has helped users receive 60 percent more likes than its free version.\nTinder Gold is designed to be an upgrade on top of its current optional subscription plan, Tinder Plus. For another $4.99 a month, Tinder Gold adds the new Likes You feature, which tells you who has already swiped right and liked your profile. \nWith Plus, users get access to extra featurs like rewind (which undos swipes you might mistakenly make), unlimited likes, five Super Likes a day, and the option to swipe from different geographic locations. When the service first launched, Tinder Plus courted controversy because subscription fees were based on age, so those who were 28 and over were paying more for the same perks. \nTinder will release Gold onto Android devices next month. \nUpdate August 29th 2PM ET: This article has been updated with confirmation from Tinder on how the pricing scheme works between Plus and Gold.\n"}
