{"title": "Urbanears cuts the cord with its Plattan 2 BT headphones", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been almost a year since Urbanears released the Plattan 2, an updated version of the original Plattan headphones, and now Urbanears is cutting the cord with the Plattan 2 BT, which (as you might have guessed) are a Bluetooth variant of that upgraded model. \nUrbanears\u2019 Plattan headphones are almost recognizable by their lack of ostentation \u2014 just a simple, flat, solid colored design. The Plattan 2 BT, much like the original Plattan 2, maintains that design, with the main difference that the Plattan 2 are wireless. It\u2019s not the first time Urbanears has released a wireless version of the Plattan, either \u2014 the original Plattan were followed up by the Plattan ADV Wireless back in 2015. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrbanears says that the Plattan 2 BT can get up to 30 plus hours of wireless playback off a single charge, which isn\u2019t bad for a pair of Bluetooth headphones, assuming it holds up in the real world. Instead of swipe controls, Urbanears is borrowing a page from the playbook of Marshall\u2019s headphones (the two share a parent company) and using a directional physical button for controlling volume, play/pause, and skipping tracks. \nThe Plattan 2 BT is available now for $99, and comes in five colors: black, dark grey, white, indigo, and tomato (i.e., red). \n"}
