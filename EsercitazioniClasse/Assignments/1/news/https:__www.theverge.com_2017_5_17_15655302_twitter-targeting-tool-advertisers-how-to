{"title": "Twitter\u2019s new tool lets you change how advertisers target you \u2014 here\u2019s how to use it", "content": " \nTwitter unveiled a new set of privacy and data controls today that allow users to see and control how advertisers target them on the platform. The company explains in a blog post that it\u2019s expanding individual access \u201cto give you the most transparent access to your Twitter information to date, including demographic and interest data, and advertisers that have included you in their tailored audiences on Twitter. Each category of data will be clearly marked, and you will be able to view or modify this data directly.\u201d \nThe update appears to be rolling out to users now, though it might not be fully available for every Twitter member yet. Here\u2019s the good news. Once you have access to the system, it will allow you to turn a lot of the advertisement targeting off. \nTo access the page, you\u2019ll first want to head to the \u201cYour Twitter data\u201d tab, located under Settings. The page includes some basic info like your username, the exact date and time you created your account, and devices you\u2019ve logged in with. If you\u2019re concerned about security, it\u2019s a good page to bookmark: it allows you to see the time, date, device, and IP location of your last 50 logins, as well as which specific locations Twitter uses to show you relevant content. \nAnyway, back to the ad targeting. If you keep scrolling through this page, you\u2019ll find the \u201cinterests\u201d section. In my case, Twitter lists 69 (nice) interests for me, and zero interests from partners (...). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Twitter, your interests are based on profile activity. Mine include categories such as \u201ccartoons,\u201d \u201cconsole gaming,\u201d \u201cpolitics,\u201d and \u201ccute,\u201d presumably because it knows that I spend most of my time on Twitter being yelled at by gamers and drowning my existential dread with pictures of adorable animals. You can remove interests, though the feature won\u2019t allow you to add any.\nIf you want to opt out of targeted ads, head to the \u201cInterests from partners\u201d section. You can turn off this feature in a few ways. First, go to \u201cpersonalization and data\u201d and deselect any options to receive personalized ads. There are a few to choose from: apps, location, web browsing history. Opt out as you see fit. \nYou\u2019ll also want to deselect the \u201cshare data through select partnerships\u201d option. Twitter notes that while this will affect which ads you see on your stream, it won't remove you from advertisers' audiences. You can request a list of which advertisers have your Twitter handle on their own marketing lists by visiting the link under \"Tailored audiences.\"\nOn its support page, Twitter explains you may also opt out of interest-based advertising via Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s consumer choice tool, as well as enable the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d or \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d setting on your phone. \nCongratulations! You have ever-so-slightly loosened yourself from the grip of capitalism. At least on Twitter. \n"}
