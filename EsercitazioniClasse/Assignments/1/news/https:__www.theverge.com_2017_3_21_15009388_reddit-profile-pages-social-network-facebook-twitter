{"title": "Reddit\u2019s new profile pages could fundamentally transform the site", "content": " \nThe next big shift in Reddit\u2019s evolution may look quite familiar. Last night, the company announced the introduction of what it\u2019s calling profile pages. This is exactly what it sounds like: a personal page tied to a username, with a feed of posts and an avatar. The change is just in the testing phase, and it\u2019s only been rolled to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, League of Legends game developer Riot Games, and prominent user Hector Janse van Rensburg, a British painter who goes by the Reddit handle Shitty_Watercolour. \nIt will over time become available to every user on the platform, the company says. While cribbing from other social networks, Reddit\u2019s new feature also specifically steers away from core aspects of Facebook and Twitter. There are no visible follower counts \u2014 only the amount of \u201ckarma,\u201d or the numeric amount of community goodwill earned from comments and posts a user has accumulated. The owner of a profile page also has far-reaching moderation tools for discussions on their own posts, including banning and muting capabilities. Cross-posting to other subreddits will also be made easier, though that will subject any post to the moderator rules of that community. \nReddit wants to keep creations on its platform\nThe goal is to encourage users to think of Reddit as more than just a destination for discussion as part of a broader community. Ohanian and product manager Lei Gong tell The Verge that it\u2019s about encouraging people to think of Reddit as a place to put their creations, to engage with fans, and to cultivate a dedicated following. Part of the reason this has been lacking on Reddit over the years, Ohanian says, is because users have been so bound by the occasionally arcane rules of subreddits that they\u2019ve been encouraged to post elsewhere \u2014 on Tumblr, Facebook, or Instagram \u2014 or not at all. \n\u201cThere are so many conversations [on Reddit] that didn\u2019t happen yet because they didn\u2019t have the right home,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a daunting thing for people who have to something to share.\u201d Prior to profile pages, everything on Reddit had to be posted to a specific community, like r/politics or r/funny, with a specific set of rules enforced by moderators. \u201cIt was hard to be proactive in creating content for Reddit.\u201d\nReddit\u2019s standout example is Shitty_Watercolour, a now-23-year-old art student who gained a following on the site starting in 2012 using just his paintings and a self-deprecating username. He did so by responding to fan requests and by serendipitously showing up in comment sections with a custom doodle to fit the situation or topic at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShitty_Watercolour grew from a low-key Reddit user to a world-famous painter. His portrait of Barack Obama during the former president\u2019s 2012 presidential run was hung in campaign headquarters.\nIllustration by Shitty_Watercolour\n\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why Shitty is awesome is because he never would have started painting anywhere else,\u201d Ohanian says. Reddit, he adds, gives people a pseudonymous avenue to explore their passions without some of the indulgent self-promotion of other social networks and without the fear of failure. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting lots and lots and lots of new people to try their hands at this.\u201d \nFor example, Ohanian points out that Reddit hosts huge communities of artists, writers, and video makers gathered around pretty much every hobby, profession, and expertise imaginable. Each of those users could create a dedicated subreddit for themselves, but Gong says that \u201cit\u2019s a very challenging process to create a subreddit with one submitter.\u201d The folks at Reddit also think the profile page will make it easier to regularly host the same kinds of discussions that make the company\u2019s Ask Me Anything format so popular, without needing to work through that subreddit\u2019s processes and scheduling. \nEven still, it\u2019s easy to see how profile pages on Reddit remove one of the site\u2019s most dearly held values: community regulation. Because many subreddits disallow promotional posts and fiercely enforce rules around formatting and content, the site has remained more or less impervious to the sway of big brands, marketers, and shameless self-promoters. Ohanian himself describes the profile page change as a way to remove the \u201cstigma of self-promotion.\u201d The inclusion of Riot Games in the initial beta test is also a clear indication that Reddit wants brands to have dedicated homes, not beholden to the community or its rulesets.  \nReddit wants to remove the \u201cstigma of self-promotion\u201d\nReddit users responding to the company\u2019s blog post on the topic have already flooded the comment section with fears about the site devolving into a distasteful combination of Twitter and Facebook, overrun with viral news farms or advertising-in-disguise. This has been especially exacerbated by Reddit\u2019s decision to allow profile page posts on the site\u2019s r/all and r/popular tabs, which are broad, ever-changing lists that inform every user of what\u2019s blowing up on the site at any given time. Gong says that last bit is subject to change. \u201cWe may take those posts out of the front page if our community responds negatively to that,\u201d he says. \nYet Reddit is a community that has, in the past, been very resistant to change, especially changes viewed to be at ends with the community and geared more toward Reddit\u2019s growth as a business. How the community responds to this change \u2014 and not necessarily whether users find the profile page interesting or useful \u2014 will dictate how Reddit moves forward. One user, r/SageWaterDragon, put it best here: \nThe majority of comments that I'm seeing here are negative \u2014 Reddit has something really special in the way that communities form and ideas spread, what you're proposing is a fundamental shift in the way the site culture would work. Make sure to listen to the criticism being leveled against this, because if Reddit loses what makes it interesting people will absolutely leave.\nReddit is confident that a slow, steady, and thoughtful approach will allow the site to maintain its community spirit while opening up new avenues for users \u2014 and businesses. \u201cThis has been a long time coming and something I\u2019ve been really keen on, especially since Steve [Huffman] and I came back about a year and a half ago,\u201d Ohanian says. \nHe and Huffman, Reddit\u2019s original founders, rejoined the company during one of its most contentious and volatile periods \u2014 after the departure of interim CEO Ellen Pao in the summer of 2015. \u201cWe had to do a lot of foundational work first,\u201d he says, of the Reddit\u2019s new mobile app and a restructuring of how the site worked on mobile. \u201cBut now we\u2019re able to unveil what I believe is a very big level-up for Reddit as a platform.\u201d \n"}
