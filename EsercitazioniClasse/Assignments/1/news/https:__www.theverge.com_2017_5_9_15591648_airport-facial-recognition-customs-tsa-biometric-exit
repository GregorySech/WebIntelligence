{"title": "Airport face recognition could extend to US citizens, says Customs", "content": " \nThe US government has rolled out a plan to reshape airport security around facial recognition, playing off a wealth of passport photos and visa applications.\nLed by Customs and Border Protection, the plan is built around the Biometric Exit program, which will register visitors leaving the US using facial recognition. But new statements show that CBP\u2019s plans could make facial scans necessary for US citizens as well, documenting them when they reenter the country or pass through TSA checkpoints. The result would eventually grow into an airport-wide system Customs officials call \u201cThe Biometric Pathway.\u201d\nJohn Wagner, deputy assistant commissioner at CBP, laid out that vision at the ConnectID conference last week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build this for [Biometric] Exit. We\u2019re out of time, we have to,\u201d Wagner told the crowd. \u201cBut why not make this available to everyone? Why not look to drive the innovation across the entire airport experience?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.\n\n\nAccording to Wagner, that could mean using facial recognition to identify travelers arriving in the US, including passport-holding citizens. As the system expands to TSA checkpoints or airport lounge access, it would also be applied to domestic travelers, regardless of citizenship status. \u201cAs soon as you check in for arrivals or departure, we\u2019re going to stage your photo in that database,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cWe want to make it available for every transaction in the airport where you have to show an ID today.\u201d \nThe Exit program is currently verifying passengers on a flight from Atlanta to Tokyo, and is set to roll out in seven new airports over the summer. Expanding it beyond departure gates will depend on partner agencies, particularly the TSA \u2014 but there\u2019s already a significant appetite for using facial recognition in other parts of the airport. Already a partner in the Atlanta test, Delta has shown early interest in the system, seeing it as an opportunity to improve customers\u2019 airport experiences. According to Delta Customer Initiatives chief Christian Revilla, who also spoke at ConnectID, airport biometrics are one of the four chief priorities set by the company\u2019s CEO for the coming year.\nReached by The Verge, Customs confirmed that it was seeking partnerships to expand the reach of the proposed system. \u201cWe are working closely with stakeholders to ensure successful implementation of biometric exit and exploring potential for inbound arrivals and other processes,\u201d an agency representative said. \u201cWe simply want to open the dialogue to others outside of CBP.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as you check in for arrivals or departure, we\u2019re going to stage your photo in that database.\u201d\nThe base of the expanded facial recognition system is biometric exit, a long-standing congressional mandate for the government to verify visa holders\u2019 identities as they leave the country. Recommended as part of the 9/11 commission, the mandate has taken on new urgency under President Trump, who fast-tracked the project in his controversial executive order on immigration this January. In the months since, CBP has settled on facial recognition as the easiest method for fulfilling the mandate. Customs obtains photos of most US visitors as part of the visa process, which can be combined with the State Department\u2019s passport photo system to assemble a database of passenger photos for any international flight. All that\u2019s left is to confirm that the faces on the flight match those photos.\nBecause the Exit requirement only extends to visa holders, newly taken photos of US citizens are discarded once confirmation has been made \u2014 but Customs left open the possibility that it would retain those photos in the future. \u201cIf we find a need to keep that, we\u2019ll work through the privacy approvals to be able to do so,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cbut for now, we\u2019re discarding that information.\u201d Notably, CBP has no legal obligation to delete photos of foreign travelers; a separate Trump executive order repealed Privacy Act protections for non-citizens earlier this year.\nAccuracy has already emerged as one of the biggest challenges for the system. Facial recognition is far less accurate than more involved biometrics like fingerprinting or iris scans, and making it work for Exit will require very particular conditions. A recent round of tests by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that, comparing against a gallery of 48,000 faces, even the best algorithms missed a quarter of flagged suspects in a boarding gate scanning scenario. Making the system work meant shrinking the gallery to 480 faces, roughly the size of a modern passenger jet, at which point the miss rate shrank to just 1 percent. The proposed Exit system has followed NIST\u2019s lead, only scanning faces against other passengers on the flight.\nA complex and secret risk-assessment algorithm\nThe new facial recognition engine will also have to deal with the chaos of the airport setting. Michigan State University professor Anil Jain, one of the main academic authorities on facial recognition, says his biggest concern is lighting and other accessories that could throw off the reading. \u201cFace recognition accuracy is very susceptible to illumination conditions,\u201d says Jain. \u201cThe person cannot smile or cry. The accuracy critically depends on these factors.\u201d Jain also has concerns about pictures more than five years old surfacing in the passport or visa database: if the source picture is old enough, a person might not match with their own face.\nAs it expands, the system will also change the way Customs greets arriving flights. CBP currently designates certain travelers for screening based on a complex and secret \u201crisk assessment\u201d algorithm, based on age, gender, country of origin, and other data. If those algorithms decide a passenger is a risk to national security, they can be pulled aside for interrogation after arrival or denied entry to the US entirely. In some cases, those stops are made as a result of FBI requests, as a means of recruiting informants from a particular region or community. More recently, Customs agents have also used the screening process to pressure visa holders into providing access to Facebook and Twitter accounts, as the government seeks to collect more data about travelers\u2019 online activities.\nExpanding facial recognition to arriving flights will have a profound impact on that secondary screening process, giving Customs a new way to split off designated passengers earlier in the process. \u201cWe have to get better segmenting people according to risk,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cAll the people that we know are going to secondary? Put them in Lane 18 or Lane 20. All the people with short connections? Put them in Lane 1 and 2. We\u2019ll be able to see the connecting information, so we\u2019ll be able to have that segmentation.\u201d\nFor critics, that could make the automated risk assessments even more harmful. EPIC\u2019s Jeremie Scott, who is currently working on a lawsuit to force Customs to release more information about the algorithm, says Customs should make the system more transparent before it makes it more powerful. \u201cIf an individual keeps getting put into a high-risk line because of AFI, they\u2019ll have no idea why and no real recourse. It\u2019s just being done by this algorithm in the background,\u201d Scott told The Verge. \u201cIt poses a large risk of flagging people who shouldn\u2019t really be in that line.\u201d\n"}
