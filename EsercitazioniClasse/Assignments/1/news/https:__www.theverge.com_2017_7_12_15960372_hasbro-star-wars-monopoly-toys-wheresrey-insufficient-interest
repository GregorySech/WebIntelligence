{"title": "Hasbro still hasn\u2019t released a Star Wars Monopoly set with Rey due to \u2018insufficient interest\u2019", "content": " \nFollowing the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, fans pointed out that its central character, Rey, was conspicuously absent from the first wave of toys, including Hasbro\u2019s new edition of Star Wars Monopoly. After the outcry, Lucasfilm announced that Rey would be a prominent part of the next wave of toys, and Hasbro said that it would add the character to the next release of the game. A year later, that hasn\u2019t happened, reports the Associated Press. \nThe 2015 edition of the game featured four of the main characters from the franchise: Luke Skywalker, Finn, Kylo Ren, and Darth Vader, but not Rey. Irritated fans started a hashtag, #wheresrey, and even the film\u2019s director, J.J. Abrams, said that Rey\u2019s absence was \u201cpreposterous.\u201d This prompted Lucasfilm to claim that her absence from the set was a way of preventing leaks about her character before the film was in theaters. \n\u201cInsufficient interest\u201d\nHasbro eventually produced the game piece for the Monopoly set, which it sold in several countries \u2014 but not the United States, according to company spokeswoman Julie Duffy. The explanation? \u201cInsufficient interest.\u201d Fans who really want the piece can contact Hasbro\u2019s customer service line to request a piece. \nHasbro\u2019s explanation that there\u2019s been insufficient interest might be technically correct: there could very well be few people asking specifically for a Star Wars Monopoly set with a Rey figure, but this ducks the bigger issue at hand: ensuring that female characters are fairly represented on toy shelves. When asked for comment, Duffy told The Verge in an e-mail that while the updated game sold in some markets, \u201cthe original version of the 2015 game was selling well [in the US] and retailers had adequate inventory so they opted not to list the new version.\u201d She went on to explain that Hasbro determines \u201cmarketplace and specific availability\u201d based on retailer interest. She also explained that Rey was later added to other games, including Operation, Trouble, and Trivial Pursuit in 2016. \nIndividually, it\u2019s a minor irritation but collectively, it speaks to a bigger issue\nThe presence or absence of a game piece or toy sitting on a store\u2019s shelves might be just a minor irritation for some, but it speaks to a larger issue. Given that children internalize gender discrepancies and attitudes from an early age, having a balance would help counter them imbuing a regressive mindset from an early age. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s limited to Star Wars toys either: in 2015, Target announced that it was moving away from gender-based signs in its toy aisles, saying that such references are unnecessary. \nSo, while Hasbro might pat itself on the back for getting the figure into the hands of consumers, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s quite a lot more that it should do. \nUpdate, July 14th: J.J. Abrams waded into the argument with one of his infamous notes on Twitter, jabbing the company by saying that players with \u201csufficient interest\u201d should contact the company. \n\n\npic.twitter.com/LcTub9Hmcn\u2014 Bad Robot (@bad_robot) July 14, 2017\n\n\n\nUpdated to include comments from Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy and a Tweet from J.J.
