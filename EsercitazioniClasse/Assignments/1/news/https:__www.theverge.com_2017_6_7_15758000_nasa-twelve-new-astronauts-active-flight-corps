{"title": "NASA adds 12 new astronauts to its active flight corps", "content": " \nToday, NASA added 12 new astronauts to its corps, which now boasts 56 active members who can be assigned to upcoming spaceflight missions. The new class is made up of five women and seven men of various backgrounds \u2014 ranging from Air Force commanders to a ocean research engineer. One is even a former SpaceX engineer.\nThe new class was announced this afternoon at a special event at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston. In attendance were numerous Texas representatives as well as Vice President Mike Pence, who gave a speech about the future of the space agency. Pence didn\u2019t mention too many specifics but did say that President Trump is \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to NASA\u2019s mission in space and that \u201cAmerica will lead the way in space once again.\u201d\nRanging from Air Force commanders to marine biologists\nPence also reconfirmed that he will head up the soon-to-be-resurrected National Space Council \u2014 an executive group aimed at guiding US space policy. The council used to exist in the \u201860s and \u201870s, and was in effect during George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration, but it was disbanded in 1993. Pence actually confirmed in March that Trump intended to relaunch the council and apparently there is already an executive order drafted to create the group, Space News reported. However, it\u2019s unclear when the council will be officially formed.\n\nAdditionally, Pence noted that NASA would continue to have the resources it needs to \u201cmake history\u201d \u2014 even though the president\u2019s budget request cuts funding and cancels certain programs at the agency. And he mentioned that NASA would continue to collaborate with the commercial space industry in the future. As for the rest of his speech, Pence touted the merits of the new astronaut class. \u201cThe courage of these men and women, and all the astronauts who have gone before, inspires me to this very day,\u201d he said.\nAnd certainly, the new astronauts are very inspiring. This group was selected from a record 18,300 applicants \u2014 more than NASA has ever had during an open astronaut call. To get picked, people have to meet some physical requirements as well as certain education and experience criteria \u2014 such as having a bachelor\u2019s degree in a STEM field or accumulating up to 1,000 hours of piloting jets. But it\u2019s clear that this new class greatly surpasses all the minimum skills that NASA requires.\nTo learn more about the 12 new hires, check out NASA\u2019s site, which has detailed biographies of each astronaut.\n"}
