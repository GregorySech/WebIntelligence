{"title": "Somebody save Huawei from itself", "content": " \nOver the past couple of years, few companies have made as much progress on the global stage of mobile technology as Huawei. Better known for providing networking infrastructure for most of its history, Huawei is quickly becoming a household name in the West, just as it\u2019s well known in its native China. But still, this old engineering giant has a few things to learn about the proper way to present its products.\nBack at IFA in September, Huawei\u2019s Nova series launch featured a 20-minute selfie masterclass from a random Instagram user. It was peculiar, it was patronizing, and it was perplexing. It also made me completely forget about the Nova phones that we were supposedly there to see. Here is but a quick highlight reel of it:\n\nAfter that event, I felt a newfound antipathy toward Huawei\u2019s new products, which I didn\u2019t experience when I\u2019d seen and used them earlier. The company literally made me hate its phones by the way it was pitching them. Oh, irony, thy name is Huawei.\nAs if to prove that IFA was no fluke, Huawei outdid itself here at Mobile World Congress. The company interrupted the launch of its new P10 flagship event for a solid 11 minutes of Pantone explaining the colors green and blue. I wasn\u2019t at the event in person, but the howls of fellow journalists stuck listening to that could be heard reverberating around the world via chat clients and social media.\n\nStarting at the 12-minute mark in the video, a well meaning Pantone representative starts to break down these two colors like some sloppily assembled color interpretation website. Green reminds us of renewal or trees, we\u2019re told. We should drink more green, we\u2019re told (which, frankly, I\u2019d have liked to get a little more elaboration on; is that advising us to make broccoli juice or what?). Green is \"almost out of touch with reality, but into another sphere.\" I\u2019ve no idea what she meant by that, I just know it had nothing to do with the Huawei P10.\nCue the camera switching to a crowd shot, where a couple of hundred impassive bodies are frozen in place by a sense of overwhelming incredulity. Six minutes is half an eternity in a new product presentation, so you\u2019d better be sure that time is invested in a compelling pitch that builds people\u2019s anticipation. Instead, Huawei and Pantone filled out the other half of an eternity with a breakdown of what blue is all about. That portion featured blue moons, the innovative idea that blue is associated with the sky, and the premise that blue has depth and mystery. You know, like the blue ocean.\nHuawei\u2019s events aren\u2019t the thing that will make or break its products, but they\u2019re the most direct way that the company speaks to its users. And that, much more than its products, is what needs the biggest improvement from the company.\nP.S. \u2014 The photo at the top of this article is from Huawei\u2019s booth. No, I can\u2019t explain it either.\n\nHuawei P10 first look\n\n\n\n\n"}
