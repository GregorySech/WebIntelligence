{"title": "Anyone can now test new Xbox One feature updates", "content": " \nMicrosoft first opened up its Xbox Insider feedback program to the public back in January, and this week it\u2019s making it easier for people to get access to beta system updates. While you could previously opt into the Xbox Insider program, test builds would only arrive shortly before being rolled out more broadly. Microsoft is now simplifying its Xbox Insider groups, and allowing people to progress through each stage to get earlier access to Xbox One dashboard software.\nKnown previously as Ring 4, the new Omega ring is the default for anyone signing up to the Xbox Insider program. It will allow participants to get a preview of a new dashboard update just before it\u2019s available broadly (like before), but if enough feedback (known as XP levels) is provided then testers will be able to progress to the Delta ring. The new Delta ring will receive builds earlier, and if enough feedback is provided (and three months of activity) then the Beta ring will be free to join.\nIt\u2019s a little less complex than before, but still complicated\nThese simplified rings are still a little complex, and Microsoft is still restricting the top-tier Alpha ring to invite-only early access. \u201cFrom time to time, our best Beta and Delta users will get invited to join the Alpha group.\u201d Microsoft is currently testing out its new Xbox One dashboard with this smaller group of Alpha testers, and it\u2019s expected to start releasing this to Beta ring testers later this month.\nMicrosoft is also working with game studios to provide playtests of unreleased games for Xbox Insiders. Sea of Thieves has been tested through this method, and Paladins will be available in the spring for all Xbox Insiders with an XP level of 10 or higher. \n"}
