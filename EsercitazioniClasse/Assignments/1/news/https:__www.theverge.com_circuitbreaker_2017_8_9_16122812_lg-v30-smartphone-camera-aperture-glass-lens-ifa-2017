{"title": "LG\u2019s V30 will be the first phone with an f/1.6 lens", "content": " \nIn the game of smartphone hype, LG\u2019s approach has been to concede defeat in trying to suppress leaks and just pre-announce everything. The company\u2019s next premier handset, the LG V30, will be made official on August 31st at IFA in Berlin, but LG\u2019s making sure we know its biggest selling point today: the camera. The V30 will be the first cameraphone with an f/1.6 lens aperture, which lets in 25 percent more light than the f/1.8 of phones likes the iPhone 7. Beside the wider aperture, the internal construction of LG\u2019s new camera will include a glass lens, which is said to deliver sharper, more faithful images.\nIt\u2019s not abundantly clear whether both cameras in LG\u2019s dual-camera setup will benefit from these improvements, but it is obvious where LG is putting the emphasis with the V30. The company is doubling down on the multimedia performance that\u2019s made the V series popular since its inception. Two years ago, the LG V10 was one of the most impressive cameraphones on the market, last year the V20 delivered the best sound among smartphones, and this year the V30 will presumably attempt to elevate both categories even further. That being said, the V30 will also have to go some way in improving on the design, which I felt took a step back last year with the big and chunky V20. To that end, LG has also revealed that the V30 will be physically smaller than its predecessor, but still have a 6-inch OLED display. It will have a 2:1 aspect ratio, like the LG G6, and a 2,880 x 1,440 resolution.\nOne of the additional improvements LG has made to its V30 imaging is a reduction in edge distortion with its wide-angle camera. The fisheye effect created by the extra wide field of view with that camera made it feel like a bit of a gimmick, but LG claims there\u2019s now a third less distortion, \u201cmaking it ideal for group wefies\u201d (Wefies? Really?!)\n"}
