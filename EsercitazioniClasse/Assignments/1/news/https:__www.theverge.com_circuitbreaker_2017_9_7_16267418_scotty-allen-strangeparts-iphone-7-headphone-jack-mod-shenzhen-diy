{"title": "Modder builds his own custom iPhone 7 that restores the headphone jack", "content": " \nAn iPhone 7 with a 3.5mm headphone jack is a dream device for any disgruntled Apple fans still mourning the loss of the port. Now, that dream device can be yours... if you\u2019re willing to mod one from scratch. \nYou may remember Scotty Allen, a former software engineer who managed to build his own iPhone 6S out of recycled and spare parts from Shenzhen\u2019s famous phone markets, but his latest project takes things a step further by not just replicating Apple\u2019s most recent smartphone, but arguably improving on it by adding back a 3.5mm headphone jack. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Scotty Allen\n\n\nWhile the 33-minute video detailing the entire build process is the best way to understand the amount of effort Allen put into the project, what he actually did is fairly simple, at least conceptually: he took apart Apple\u2019s official 3.5mm to Lighting adapter, and built it right into the phone.\nAs you\u2019d expect, it was incredibly complicated and expensive. Allen had to design his own circuit board to integrate Apple\u2019s adapter, figure out how to actually fit that circuit board into the phone, and of course, build the actual phone. \nYou still can\u2019t use the headphone jack while charging your phone, unfortunately\nThere are also a few limitations to Allen\u2019s design. Due to how Apple\u2019s Lightning adaptor works, you unfortunately still can\u2019t use the headphone jack while charging your phone. And if you\u2019re hoping to modify your existing device (Allen has made the custom circuit board design open source so that others can put their own together), you\u2019ll have to move around some internal components \u2014 including the taptic engine and battery to get everything to fit. \nAccording to Allen, the entire project cost him somewhere in the range of \u201cthousands of dollars,\u201d which he spent on three iPhone 7 devices for parts, screens, and tons of Apple\u2019s headphone adapters.\nStill, if you truly can\u2019t live without a headphone jack on your iPhone 7, at least now you  know that it is theoretically possible for one to exist \u2014 even if it is probably easier to just get a pair of Bluetooth headphones. \n"}
