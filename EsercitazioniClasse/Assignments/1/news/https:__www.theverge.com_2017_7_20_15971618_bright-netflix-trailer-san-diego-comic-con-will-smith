{"title": "Watch the new trailer for Netflix\u2019s $100 million fantasy epic Bright", "content": " \nThe first trailer for Netflix\u2019s most expensive original film to date has premiered at San Diego Comic-Con. \nBright, from Suicide Squad and End of Watch director David Ayer, is a fantasy epic starring Will Smith as a human cop and Joel Edgerton as some kind of Orc cop. The film takes place in an alternate version of the present day that also involves elves and fairies. \nRegardless of your feelings about the man at the helm here, this is likely to be a huge movie for Netflix. Its original film strategy is slowly taking on a discernible shape, and the thrust of it seems to be \u201cThe bigger and weirder, the better.\u201d If what we saw in Suicide Squad was Ayer toned down by the tightening vice of studio pressures, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what he does with a similar budget and complete creative freedom. If this trailer is any indication, it should at least be equally offensive to the senses.\nThis time around, Ayer is working from a screenplay by Max Landis, best known for the critically reviled one-two punch of Victor Frankenstein and American Ultra in 2015. Ayer has made a decent cop movie before, 2012\u2019s End of Watch with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a. So, you know... who knows.\nSmith also helped finance the film through his production company Overbrook Entertainment, which has backed the majority of his films since Wild Wild West in 1999.\nBright is scheduled for release on Netflix sometime on December 22nd.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article listed Blues Brothers 2000 as a previous credit of Max Landis\u2019, but that movie was written by his father. \n"}
