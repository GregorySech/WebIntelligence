{"title": "Windows 10's new Start menu design revealed in leaked screenshot", "content": " \nMicrosoft is planning to refresh its Windows 10 design in an upcoming update due later this year. While the software maker is starting to roll out Windows 10 Creators Update this week, the focus on the company\u2019s Windows 10 efforts will rapidly shift to this future update shortly. We\u2019ve seen a number of concept screenshots of Microsoft\u2019s plans for its Windows 10 design refresh before, and today another screenshot has leaked.\nTom Hounsell published a new Windows 10 Start menu design concept to Twitter today, complete with new transparency effects for the Live Tiles on the Start menu. Sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the company has been experimenting with transparency effects on the Start menu, and that this screenshot is simply a concept of those ideas.\nThese design mockups are simply Microsoft\u2019s experiments with how it plans to refresh its Windows 10 design. A Snapchat app icon can be seen in the Start menu, but this is just a placeholder used in mockups and not an indication that Snapchat will arrive on Windows 10. Microsoft is expected to detail more of its Windows 10 design plans during the company\u2019s Build developers conference in Seattle next month.\n"}
