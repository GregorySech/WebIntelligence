Fidget spinners, like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, are all of these things at the same time \u2014 until you metaphorically kill the cat by clicking through to one of the stories. \nDo a search for just \u201cspinner,\u201d though, and you\u2019ll see that Google wants in on the craze, regardless of alleged associations to the Holy Trinity, or whether or not it will lead to carpal tunnel. Yes, you can now spin a virtual fidget spinner underneath the Google search box. \nGoogle\u2019s far from the first to try to make a digital fidget spinner. A recent rush of developers flooded the App Store with fidget spinner apps, even though the idea totally misses the point of fidget spinners in the first place.
