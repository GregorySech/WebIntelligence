{"title": "Windows 10 S: everything you need to know about Microsoft\u2019s Chrome OS competitor", "content": " \nMicrosoft launched its latest version of Windows 10 yesterday, Windows 10 S. It\u2019s designed for education and to take on Chromebooks and Chrome OS. Just like Google\u2019s own OS, Windows 10 S is fairly locked down in places and you\u2019ll only be able to run apps from the Windows Store. Microsoft explained some aspects of Windows 10 S onstage yesterday, but there\u2019s a lot more to this new version. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\nOnly Windows Store apps will work\nThe biggest change to Windows 10 S is that it\u2019s locked to only work with Windows Store apps. That means you\u2019ll need to find apps in the Store to download and install them, and many desktop apps like Photoshop and Chrome simply aren\u2019t in the Store yet. Microsoft does allow developers to port their desktop apps into the Windows Store, but not many have taken advantage of this feature just yet.\nMicrosoft is adding its full suite of Office apps to the Windows Store, and Spotify has committed to bringing its music streaming app to the Store. Microsoft will need popular apps like iTunes, Chrome, and Photoshop to make Windows 10 S more usable for most people. It\u2019s the hundreds of utility apps that are unlikely to ever be made available in the Windows Store, and if you need those then Windows 10 S probably isn\u2019t for you.\nSecurity and performance\nMicrosoft claims that security and performance will both be improved with Windows 10 S. Apps won\u2019t be able to run unless they\u2019re packaged and available in the Windows Store, so that should help prevent malware and unnecessary app helpers from running at boot up. Microsoft has also improved the first sign-in process of Windows 10 S, with better login times which will help in environments like schools.\nOverall, these changes and the lock to Windows Store apps and Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser should improve battery life. Microsoft has focused on battery life for its Windows 10 S devices to ensure students can use laptops for the majority of the day.\nDefault browser and search settings are locked to Microsoft\nMicrosoft will support alternative browsers in the Windows Store, but Windows 10 S users won\u2019t be able to alter their default browser. That means if you click on a link from an app in Windows 10 S then you\u2019ll be forced into Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser. That\u2019s similar to Google\u2019s Chrome OS, which only lets you use Chrome as the browser.\nMicrosoft is also locking down Microsoft Edge to only work with its Bing search engine in Windows 10 S. That means you won\u2019t be able to switch to Google search to easily type in queries in the address bar or elsewhere, and you\u2019ll have to access the search service through Google.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\nIt looks and works just like Windows 10\nWindows 10 S isn\u2019t a lite version of Windows 10, and it looks and functions mostly the same. PC makers like HP and Acer will sell laptops running Windows 10 S this summer, and schools can opt to switch from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 S free of charge. \nWindows 10 S can be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro\nFortunately, if you need desktop apps that aren\u2019t in the Windows Store then Microsoft has a quick fix for Windows 10 S. For $49 you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and get access to desktop apps. On a low-cost device this seems reasonable, but it\u2019s an additional cost for more premium devices. We haven\u2019t seen many of those announced with Windows 10 S yet, but Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop will include a free Windows 10 Pro upgrade until the end of the year.\nIsn\u2019t this Windows RT 2.0?\nIt\u2019s tempting to brand this as another Windows RT experiment or even a follow-up to Windows 8.1 with Bing, but Windows 10 S differs in many key ways. Microsoft is targeting this at education and not tablet users, and desktop apps can run this time if they\u2019re in the Windows Store. Even if they\u2019re not then there is a fix to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, whereas Windows RT users were left stranded with an OS that looked like Windows but didn\u2019t function like it at all.\nThis new OS will likely lead to some confusion for users who pick up a cheap laptop and want to start running desktop apps and can\u2019t find them in the Store, though. That was a major hurdle for Windows RT, and Microsoft will have to manage the inevitable consumer confusion better this time around.\nSo why has Microsoft created Windows 10 S?\nMicrosoft says its primary goal with Windows 10 S is education, but it\u2019s clear this is a strategic move, too. Microsoft hasn\u2019t had much success with its Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10, especially given Windows Phone has less than 1 percent market share. App developers haven\u2019t flocked to UWP as a result, and it\u2019s clear for the Windows Store to be a success it needs to attract desktop apps.\nBy allowing developers to port their apps to the Windows Store, it boosts Microsoft\u2019s control over the Windows ecosystem and even its revenue thanks to the percentage it takes from app sales. It might even force companies like Google, that have traditionally avoided UWP, to get apps into the Windows Store.\nOverall, Windows 10 S is a test for Microsoft to try and better secure and improve the experience of Windows. Desktop apps have had the freedom to run wild in Windows for years, and Windows 10 S is Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt at trying to move Windows to a more modern environment.\n"}
