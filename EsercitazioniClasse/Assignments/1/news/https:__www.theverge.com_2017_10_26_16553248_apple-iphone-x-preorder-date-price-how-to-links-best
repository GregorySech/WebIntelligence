{"title": "How to preorder the iPhone X", "content": " \nPreorders for the iPhone X open at 3:01AM ET (12:01AM PT) tonight at Apple, phone carriers, and other retailers. Demand is going to be high, and supply is said to be pretty low \u2014 at least if you\u2019re hoping to get the phone on its November 3rd release date or soon after. If you\u2019re not willing to wake up in the middle of the night, get your preorder in, and go back to sleep, you might not be able to walk into a store and buy an iPhone X until sometime in 2018. \nChoose which company you\u2019ll be trying to order with, set your alarm for 10 or 15 minutes before it all starts, and give it your best shot. Tim Cook casually told BuzzFeed News \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d regarding potential iPhone X shortages. Whatever does happen, just know that millions of people will likely be half awake and enduring this process with you. If shipping dates quickly fall back by weeks or months, there\u2019s always the option of camping out in line for hours and hours at your nearest Apple Store on the eve of November 3rd. \nApple\nPreorder here or through the Apple Store iOS app starting at 3:01AM ET.\nApple almost certainly has more phones to go around than any of its carrier partners or resellers, so buying direct from the company is your best bet. In the past, the Apple Store app on iOS has sometimes gone live with preorders a few minutes before the web store, so if you\u2019ve got an existing iPhone or iPad at the ready, this should be your plan. \nTo breeze through checkout, make sure you\u2019ve set up Apple Pay with up-to-date payment info and the right credit/debit card. It\u2019s also smart to save the iPhone X model you want (picking both color and storage capacity ahead of time) as a favorite item in the Apple Store app. You want to eliminate as many steps and taps as possible for when the time comes. \nIf you\u2019ll be paying monthly with a carrier plan, use this tool from Apple to make sure your AT&T / Sprint / Verizon account is in good standing and eligible for an upgrade. \nApple supports most of the monthly payment plans from all the major US carriers except for T-Mobile, which should make it easier to swallow the iPhone X\u2019s $999 starting price. You\u2019ve also got the option of financing directly with Apple and joining the iPhone Upgrade Program. The company has been offering pre-approval to speed up that process.\nPricing:64GB iPhone X $999.00 or $49.91 for 24 months (iPhone Upgrade Program) or preferred carrier financing256GB iPhone X $1,149.00 or $56.16 for 24 months (iPhone Upgrade Program) or preferred carrier financingNote: Apple doesn\u2019t offer T-Mobile\u2019s financing options when ordering online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart from Apple lays out 64GB iPhone X pricing options for all major carriers except T-Mobile.\n\n\nAT&T\nPreorder here or with the myAT&T app starting at 3:01AM ET.\nAT&T says it has recently streamlined its online ordering process, so customers should only have to deal with \u201cthree screens\u201d to place an iPhone X preorder. Note that it appears you\u2019ll be paying a few more cents each month when ordering direct from AT&T versus Apple.\nPricing:64GB iPhone X $999.99 or $33.34 for 30 months or $41.67 for 24 months256GB iPhone X $1149.99 or $38.34 for 30 months or $47.92 for 24 months\nBest Buy\nPick your carrier here and preorder starting at 3:01AM ET.\nBest Buy is inexplicably charging a $100 premium if you purchase the iPhone X at full price. The 64GB model is $1,099 and 256GB is $1,249.99. Shame on you, Best Buy. \nThe monthly financing plans aren\u2019t marked up in this way and reflect regular pricing, so you should choose one of those for your respective carrier if this is where you\u2019re buying. Note that Best Buy doesn\u2019t offer T-Mobile-specific devices or financing.\nPricing:64GB iPhone X $1,099.99 or preferred carrier financing256GB iPhone X $1,249.99 or preferred carrier financingNote: Best Buy does not offer T-Mobile iPhones. \nSprint\nPreorder here starting at 3:00AM ET.\nSprint is apparently getting a 1-minute jump on everyone else (even Apple) if that preorder time of 3:00AM ET on the dot holds true. I\u2019m doubtful, but hey.\nPricing:64GB iPhone X $999.99 or lease for $0 down and 18 monthly payments of $41.67256GB iPhone X $1149.99 or lease for $150 down and 18 monthly payments of $41.67 (Note: you won\u2019t actually own the device at the end of Sprint\u2019s leasing term, but have the option of paying the rest of what\u2019s due or upgrading and starting a new lease.)\nPromotions: Save $350 with eligible trade-in (via bill credit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s chart for 256GB iPhone X pricing.\n\n\nT-Mobile\nPreorder here starting at 3:01AM ET.\nThe main thing to be aware of with T-Mobile is that you\u2019re required to hand over a significant down payment at the time of preorder. Most other carriers are $0 down with an optional down payment to lower monthly costs, but nothing\u2019s optional with T-Mobile. \nPricing:64GB iPhone X $999.99 or $279.99 down payment and $30 for 24 months256GB iPhone X $1149.99 or $429.99 down payment and $30 for 24 months\nPromotions:Up to $300 for eligible trade-ins.Qualifying devices: Apple iPhone 7 / iPhone 7 Plus / iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / iPhone 6S / 6S Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8 / Galaxy S8+ / Galaxy S7 / Galaxy S7 Edge / Note 5, LG G5 / G6 / V20, Google Pixel / Pixel XL, Motorola Z Droid / Z Play / Z2 Force / Z Force Droid / Z2 Play, BlackBerry KEYone, HTC U11\nTarget\nPreorder here starting at 3:01AM ET. \nIt\u2019s hard for me to recommend that Target be your first choice for preordering an iPhone X, but if you strike out elsewhere early on Friday, it might be worth a look.\nUS Cellular\nPreorder here starting at 3:01AM ET. \nVerizon Wireless\nPreorder here or with the My Verizon app starting at 3:01AM ET.\nPricing:64GB iPhone X $999.99 or $41.66 for 24 months256GB iPhone X $1149.99 or $47.91 for 24 months\nPromotions:Up to $300 for eligible trade-ins (via bill credit).Eligible for $300 off: iPhone 6S / 6S Plus / 7 / 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, LG G6, Motorola: Z2 Force, Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+Eligible for $200 off: Apple iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / SE, Google: Pixel, LG G5 / V20, Motorola Z Force / Z Droid / Z2 Play, Samsung Galaxy S6 / Galaxy S6 edge / Galaxy S6 edge+ / Note 5Eligible for $100 off: Apple iPhone 5 / 5C / 5S, HTC 10, Motorola Z Play, Samsung Galaxy S5 / Note Edge / Note 4\n"}
