{"title": "This glass sticker turns your MacBook\u2019s trackpad into a number pad", "content": " \nIt\u2019s pretty rare to see a laptop with a full number pad. In fact, none of Apple\u2019s MacBooks have ever had one. But if you\u2019re someone who does some serious number crunching, Nums might be able to help.\nCurrently looking for funding on Kickstarter, Nums is essentially a giant glass panel that attaches to the top of your MacBook\u2019s multi-touch trackpad, adding an overlay for a traditional numpad along with a few quick launch gestures. Obviously, just sticking some numbers onto your trackpad won\u2019t turn it into a number pad. Nums creator Luckey is also developing a driver for Apple\u2019s computers that allows users to quickly switch the trackpad to number-entry mode, as well as open the calculator app and even serve as a quick launcher for websites or other applications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNums is built out of a 0.26mm thick piece of glass, with metallic ink used for the numbers that\u2019s designed to reflect the light from the display for use in the dark. And Luckey claims that the Nums panel won\u2019t effect your regular trackpad use, which is definitely a good thing. \nFor now, the company is only working on Nums pads for the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 12-inch MacBook, and Retina MacBook Pros built after 2012. The Kickstarter page notes that it hopes to develop Nums for other computers in the future, but the non-standard size of Windows trackpads make that difficult. (Luckey is apparently working on Nums for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line next.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nums panels are available for between $32 and $45 on Kickstarter, depending on the size of your computer\u2019s trackpad. That is kind of expensive for a glass sticker, especially if Luckey makes the driver a free download. Additionally, this is Luckey\u2019s first Kickstarter, so the usual warnings about crowdfunding apply here. \nLuckey hopes to ship Nums in July, assuming the project meets its funding goals. \n"}
