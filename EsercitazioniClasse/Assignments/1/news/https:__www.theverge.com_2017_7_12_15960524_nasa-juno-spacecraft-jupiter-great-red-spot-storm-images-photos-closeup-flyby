{"title": "NASA just released Juno\u2019s first stunning close-ups of Jupiter\u2019s giant storm", "content": " \nNASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft has sent back the first photos from its close flyby over Jupiter\u2019s famous Great Red Spot. The mysterious, extraterrestrial cyclone \u2014 which is twice as wide as Earth \u2014 has captivated scientists since the 1800s. Now, people can see the closest ever view of the massive storm for themselves.  \nJuno has been orbiting Jupiter for a little over a year on a mission to study the planet\u2019s interior, atmosphere, and magnetosphere. Its elliptical orbit around the planet takes the probe close to the surface for a few hours every 53 days. These are called perijove passes \u2014 and on July 10th, Juno completed its seventh. A little after its closest approach, Juno\u2019s camera, JunoCam, snapped a few shots of the storm from about 5,000 miles above. \n\n\nSpot spotted! #JunoCam raw images from my #Jupiter #GreatRedSpot flyby are available now.

But with Juno, NASA\u2019s opened up the process to the public: space fans can weigh in on the photos JunoCam shoots by ranking their favorite points of interest. After the photos are taken, NASA releases the raw images for the public to process. People can crop them, assemble them into collages, and change or enhance the colors. The results are mesmerizing, so we rounded up a few of the highlights:\n\n\nHere's another processed raw image from @NASAJuno's #GRSflyover on Monday night: pic.twitter.com/uLmpXvnoki\u2014 Jason Major (@JPMajor) July 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nJumping in on processing @NASAJuno #GreatRedSpot images.
