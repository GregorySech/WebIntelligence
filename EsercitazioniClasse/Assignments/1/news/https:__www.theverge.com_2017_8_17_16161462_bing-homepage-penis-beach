{"title": "Microsoft forced to Photoshop penis out of Bing homepage", "content": " \nBing.com, Microsoft's search engine, always features an image on its homepage. It changes every day. Today, Bing is displaying the gorgeous beach on Bra\u010d Island in Croatia. Seriously, this beach is dreamy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\nRight? So nice. But developer Andrew Lyle noticed an odd shape carved into the white pebble sand.\n\n\nLol there's a penis carved into the sand on https://t.co/QaCFpLgwDP homepage https://t.co/vdTVPn0NMO\u2014 /* Andrew Lyle */ (@lylesback2) August 17, 2017\n\n\n\nSay what? Let's take a closer look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\nYeah, that's definitely a penis. I'd like to thank Bing for giving us this image and perhaps intentionally putting a penis on its homepage. I'd also like to thank Andrew Lyle for his keen penis-spotting eye. And I'd like to thank the beachgoer who took the time to carve this enormous penis into the beautiful sand on Bra\u010d Island. You're all great.\nUpdate 8/17, 12:27 PM ET: Microsoft has since edited the penis out of its beach photo. This is what now displays on the Bing homepage. Notice the lacking penis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n"}
