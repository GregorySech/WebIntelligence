{"title": "Shia LaBeouf\u2019s latest art project involves texting people from a remote cabin in Finland", "content": " \nShia LaBeouf just began another Hashtag Art Project called #ALONETOGETHER to follow up the hitchhiking one, the movie one, and the elevator one. The project, done in collaboration with Finland\u2019s Kiasma Museum, will see Shia and his collaborators Nastja Ronkko and Luke Turner sequester themselves in a remote part of Finland for a month. \nWhat\u2019s Shia LaBeouf\u2019s phone number?\nBeginning today, LaBeouf, Ronkko, and Turner will set up camp in three separate cabins in Finland\u2019s Lapland region, AP reports. Inside the Helsinki museum is another small cabin fitted with a video stream to the Lapland cabins. From the museum cabin, visitors will be able to speak directly to the artists, but LaBeouf, Ronkko, and Turner will only be able to respond via text. The artists will only be able to text museum visitors, and no one else \u2014 not even each other.\nOn the project\u2019s website, anyone not in Finland can watch a live stream of the gallery with the artists\u2019 texts streaming in real time on the bottom of the screen. The texts are sometimes difficult to follow, because there\u2019s no way to tell exactly what they\u2019re replying to, or who is sending them. But that one-sided disconnect somehow makes them even more interesting; it\u2019s like eavesdropping on half a conversation and imagining the other half.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaBeouf\u2019s most recent (and probably his most controversial) project, He Will Not Divide Us, moved overseas last month after it was targeted by online trolls and Trump supporters and eventually shut down by the Museum of the Moving Image.\n#ALONETOGETHER feels like a return to LaBeouf\u2019s earlier work, which usually focuses on human interaction, communication, and shifting our idea of the modern celebrity. It\u2019s not clear what kind of entertainment or luxuries the cabins are equipped with, if any, but LaBeouf\u2019s preferred state of comfort seems to come from the idea that people are once again watching him. \n"}
