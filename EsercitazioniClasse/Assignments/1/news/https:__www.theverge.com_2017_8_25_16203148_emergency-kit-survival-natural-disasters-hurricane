{"title": "Here\u2019s what you need in your emergency hurricane kit", "content": " \nHurricane Harvey is expected to hit Texas tonight \u2014 and residents of cities like Corpus Christi and Port Mansfield could face coastal flooding, torrential rains, and winds of up to 110 miles per hour. In such emergency situations, it\u2019s smart to have a Go Bag ready with basic necessities.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends stockpiling enough emergency supplies to last you, your loved ones, and your pets roughly three days. These emergency kits should be ready before the hurricane hits, so you can grab them quickly in case you need to evacuate. Also, have your gas tank topped off and be prepared to respond to any evacuation orders. \nTo be clear, there\u2019s a lot more to bracing for a disaster than packing the right gadgets. FEMA outlines how to prepare your home and your family for a hurricane, like bringing loose objects and patio furniture indoors. It\u2019s also a good idea to map out an evacuation route ahead of time and how to contact one another if phone lines go down. (And don\u2019t delay evacuating or put yourself in danger to run out and grab supplies \u2014 your life is more important.)\nThere are excellent, comprehensive packing lists for your survival kit all over the internet (see the sidebar). We\u2019ve rounded up a few things you might want to include:\n\n\nComprehensive survival kit packing lists\n\nReady.gov\nTexas Department of State Health Services\nThe SweetHome\nThe Bug Out Bag Academy\nNational Weather Service\nFEMA\n\n\n\nWater\nYou should store enough water to last at least three days, although two weeks\u2019 worth would be ideal. A good rule of thumb is a gallon of water per day per person (and pet), but you might want more if it\u2019s very hot out or you\u2019re pregnant. \nYou should also be ready to disinfect the water. If there\u2019s been flooding, even if the tap turns back on, the water might not be safe to drink because of bacterial contamination, says Chris van Deusen, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. \nYou can disinfect water by boiling it for at least a minute on a stove or fire, or by using water purification tablets like iodine or chlorine dioxide. (CDC has tips for other DIY disinfectants.) In my emergency kit, I have a filter you can stick directly into a water source or vessel filled with contaminated water, called a Lifestraw. It\u2019s supposed to remove most waterborne microbes from my water, although I have yet to test it out.\nFood\nYou should store at least three days of non-perishable food, including canned and dehydrated food. A mix of both is best: canned food is heavier but dehydrated food needs water to be eaten, and if you\u2019re rationing water already, that might a problem. Also, remember a can opener! \nTry to go for familiar foods: you don\u2019t know how your gut will react to a can of beans if you don\u2019t usually eat them. Plus, your favorite comfort foods can be a good mood booster, the CDC says. If you\u2019re packing for an infant or a pet, don\u2019t forget baby formula and pet food. \nMedical supplies and personal care products\nPack a week\u2019s supply of your prescription drugs in a waterproof container or bag. CVS and Walgreens recommend visiting your local pharmacy to stock up ahead of time. If your medications need to be kept cold, have a small cooler and ice on hand, too. And don\u2019t forget spare parts and batteries for medical devices. \nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure to have a first aid kit, bandages, hand sanitizer, and the over-the-counter meds you rely on. For me, that means ibuprofen, antihistamines, and a source of caffeine to stave off caffeine withdrawal headaches. If you smoke, you might also want to tuck away some kind of nicotine replacement. \nIf you\u2019re a person who menstruates, pack pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup. If you\u2019re packing for a baby, don\u2019t forget diapers. Also, pack condoms. (Not to be flippant, but  blizzard babies are a thing.) \nDocuments\nAside from cash, copies of your credit cards, insurance policies and some form of ID (passport, or driver\u2019s license), you want to pack hard copies of your prescriptions and your health insurance card in a waterproof container or ziplock bag. You\u2019ll need those if you have to stock up on meds at a pharmacy that\u2019s not your own. Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Chris Van Deusen also recommends keeping a utility bill, and a copy of the title to your home and car, in case you need to prove ownership and residency status when you\u2019re allowed to return to evacuated areas. \nElectronics\nA cell phone can be critical during an emergency, so you\u2019ll want a way to recharge it if the power\u2019s out. You can do that with a USB battery pack, a DIY phone charger (just, don\u2019t electrocute yourself), and/or a power inverter that will let you charge your devices with your car\u2019s battery. \nJust in case something happens to your phone during an evacuation, Consumer Reports recommends keeping a prepaid phone and a spare battery in your emergency kit, as well. You\u2019ll also want an emergency radio, possibly with a hand crank so you can easily recharge it, to keep track of weather alerts. \nClothing \nYou\u2019ll want changes of underwear, comfortable shoes, and clean wool socks. (Wool is better for preventing blisters, if you have to walk long distances.) You can vacuum pack clothing to save on space, or try the skivvy roll to pack your undies into a neat, sock-encased bundle. \nOthers\nYou might also want to include some kind of multitool or knife, a wrench so you can turn off the gas line to your house if necessary, flashlights, a tarp or shelter, fire starters like lighters or matches, a notebook, and pencil. You might also want to grab valuables and items of sentimental importance, like photos, Bug Out Bag Academy\u2019s Andrew Pontius says. \nEvery person has slightly different survival needs, so pack accordingly. (For example, if you\u2019re prone to diarrhea, pack some rehydration salts and anti-diarrheals with your doctor\u2019s approval.) Also, keep in mind that prescription drugs can expire and plastic water jugs can degrade. So remember to check and update your Go Bag on a regular basis. And if there\u2019s any gear we\u2019ve forgotten, let us know in the comments. \n\n"}
