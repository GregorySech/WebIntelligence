{"title": "Show Notes: My nightmare is called Apple iMessage Stories", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nI got sick at SXSW last week so Show Notes fell off a bit... but I\u2019m back! And only slightly loaded up on cough syrup! Lots to talk about today, and some stuff from the end of last week I want to touch on as well. Let\u2019s get to it.\nTHE ENTIRE ARGUMENT FOR NET NEUTRALITY TO EXIST\n\nLauren Goode spent two days with Netflix leading up to the launch of Iron Fist. (Which appears to be just terrible.) But she learned a lot about Netflix\u2019s future plans, including recutting shows specifically for mobile and replacing the five-star rating system with thumbs-up and thumbs-down.\nLauren was also the only journalist to press Reed Hastings on net neutrality during the event \u2014 Netflix was an aggressively vocal champion of net neutrality through 2015, when the FCC passed the Open Internet Order. How aggressive? In 2014, the company threatened to have its subscribers protest ISPs if it didn\u2019t get its way.\nBut in 2017, with new FCC chairman Ajit Pai clearly indicating that he plans to dismantle net neutrality and let ISPs go crazy, Hastings told Lauren that \u201che\u2019s not too worried... even if the formal framework gets weakened, because consumers know they\u2019re entitled to getting all of the web services.\u201d Translation: Netflix will be fine, because no ISP is stupid enough to screw with Netflix and its 50 million passionate subscribers\nJake Kastrenakes charted Netflix\u2019s positions on net neutrality over the years; you can clearly see the company walk back from its early position as it gets bigger and gains more leverage with ISPs.\nSo basically: now that Netflix was able to use the open internet to grow a huge audience, it\u2019s mostly fine with net neutrality going away because it has the leverage to demand favorable treatment.\nAnd being able to cut favorable deals means that upstart rivals to Netflix won\u2019t be able to compete on a level playing field. Which is very smart business for Netflix.\nBut very sad for the internet economy and startup culture: how can a new rival compete with a prioritized or zero-rated Netflix if its service is delivered more slowly or costs more in data charges?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIXBY GOES DOWN\n\nSamsung\u2019s big Galaxy S8 event is next week on the 29th, and we\u2019ll have full blowout coverage. But the news started today: Dan Seifert wrote up Bixby, Samsung\u2019s new voice assistant. The twist is that Bixby isn\u2019t designed to go out and answers questions from the cloud, like Google Assistant or Siri or whatever \u2014 it\u2019s designed to actually operate your phone for you.\nIt sounds like Samsung is trying to merge touch and voice \u2014 you can tap on the screen and then ask for help to keep going or to complete the task you started. It\u2019s very clever conceptually \u2014 and it patches a hole that other voice assistants have left open, but of course you have to use \u201cBixby-enabled\u201d apps for it all to work. And you just know that means you\u2019ll be locked into Samsung\u2019s apps, because Android developers don\u2019t typically race to support new APIs, let alone weird APIs for one phone.\nDan, fire emoji: \n\nBixby exists to solve one of the most difficult challenges in all of tech: make Samsung\u2019s own poorly designed software and interfaces easier to use.\nA TRAIN OF THOUGHT ABOUT APPLE AND AR\n\nApple is working on several AR features for the next iPhone, according to Bloomberg scoop-machine Mark Gurman. There are two ways to read the rumored list of features: either Apple is working on super wild new AR ideas, or it\u2019s doing a lot of work to deliver what sounds like slightly better riffs on Snapchat filters.\nApple has riffed on Instagram filters in the past \u2014 they\u2019re right there in the camera app \u2014 but they didn\u2019t exactly set the world on fire. The value of these things isn\u2019t their quality, it\u2019s the social distribution networks to which they\u2019re attached, and Apple hasn\u2019t historically done a great job of building social tools.\nExcept for iMessage. Maybe this is part of iMessage? That would be super interesting.\nA full-on iMessage reboot with filters and stories is exactly the sort of nightmare 2017 seems poised to deliver.\nBut Apple doesn\u2019t need to do that, because iMessage doesn\u2019t have to make any money on its own, as Snapchat and Instagram and Whatsapp have to do. It just has to lock you into never leaving iOS and always buying a new iPhone, and it is spectacular at doing that.\nApple figuring out how to walk the line between distributing cool new AR photo features and not screwing too much with iMessage is going to be really interesting to see come together, if this is indeed all happening with this next iPhone.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nHere is Jeff Bezos in a giant robot.\nThe Uber executive exodus just keeps happening.\nFinally, what is HTC even doing anymore?\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\n\n\n\nemail address...\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n    By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n"}
