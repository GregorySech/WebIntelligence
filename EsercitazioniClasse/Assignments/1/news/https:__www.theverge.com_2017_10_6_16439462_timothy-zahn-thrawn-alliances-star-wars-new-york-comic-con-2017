{"title": "Timothy Zahn is writing a sequel to Thrawn", "content": " \nAt Lucasfilm\u2019s publishing panel at New York City Comic Con today, Timothy Zahn announced that he will be writing a sequel to this year\u2019s Star Wars Rebels tie-in novel, Thrawn. \nZahn didn\u2019t reveal much about the book. It has a working title of Thrawn: Alliances, and it will feature another iconic Star Wars villain: Darth Vader. The book will presumably pick up with where Thrawn left off, with the character now a Grand Admiral, and his loyal assistant headed off into the depths of Unknown Space on a secret mission. According to Del Rey, the novel will hit stores in Summer 2018. \n\n\nThrawn is back. And he's bringing Vader with him.

Earlier this year, he told The Verge that Thrawn has endured \u201cbecause he was so different from any other villain we\u2019d seen in Star Wars to that time,\u201d using strategy and tactics over brute force. While Lucasfilm rendered the Star Wars Expanded Universe non-canon in the lead up to The Force Awakens, Star Wars Rebels executive producer reintroduced him in the show, and Zahn returned to write his origin story. The novel was left on an open-ended note, leaving open the possibility for a sequel novel.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nTimothy Zahn finally unveils the origin story of one of the greatest Star Wars villains in Thrawn\n\nAlliances isn\u2019t the only place that we\u2019ll see Thrawn next year.
