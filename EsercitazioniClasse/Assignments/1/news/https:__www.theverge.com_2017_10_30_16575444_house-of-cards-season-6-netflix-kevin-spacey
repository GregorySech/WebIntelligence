{"title": "House of Cards\u2019 next season will be its last", "content": " \nNetflix\u2019s political drama House of Cards will end with its upcoming season in 2018. The company confirmed the show\u2019s final season to Variety today, following sexual assault allegations against the show\u2019s leading man, Kevin Spacey.\nStar Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed that Spacey made sexual advances toward him when he was 14; Spacey was 26 at the time. Following the allegations, Netflix told The Verge that the company, along with Media Rights capital, is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the news. \u201cIn response to last night\u2019s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cAs previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.\u201d\nNetflix had no comment about whether the news about the show\u2019s final season was related to the accusations. Although House of Cards has been one of Netflix\u2019s most acclaimed dramas, it was also approaching its sixth season, and production continues for now. \nSpacey has since responded to the allegations online for his \u201cinappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d The apology was followed by Spacey coming out as gay, drawing swift backlash from members of the LGBT community and president and CEO of GLAAD, Sarah Kate Ellis, for conflating homosexuality with pedophilia. \n\u201cComing out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault,\u201d Ellis said on Twitter. \u201cThis isn't a coming out story about Spacey, but a story of survivorship by Anthony Rapp & those who speak out about unwanted sexual advances.\u201d\nThe House of Cards actor joins a growing list of powerful men in Hollywood who are being accused of sexual misconduct or assault, starting with the accusations against Harvey Weinstein. Dozens of women have come forward to talk about Weinstein\u2019s actions, including Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Heather Graham, Cara Delevingne, Kate Beckinsale, Rose McGowan, and Lena Headey. The fallout from Weinstein has been swift and widespread to other industries as well.\n"}
