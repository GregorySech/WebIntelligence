{"title": "Facebook announces News Feed guidelines for publishers", "content": " \nIn an attempt to provide more transparency on how Facebook\u2019s News Feed ranks content, the company today announced a new set of guidelines for publishers.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say something that\u2019s going to change over time.\u201d\nAdam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s head of the News Feed, said during an announcement at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism that the guidelines were meant to provide standards that were \u201cmore clear about what works and what doesn\u2019t on our platform.\u201d \nThe guidelines do not seem to include any substantive changes to Facebook\u2019s policies for publishers, but put the current rules in one place. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say something that\u2019s going to change over time,\u201d Mosseri said. The guidelines centralize some of the advice Facebook has previously given, noting that the company demotes content it believes to be \u201cclickbait,\u201d for example, or that links to \u201clow-quality\u201d or \u201cdeceptive\u201d web pages. The company says it uses similar signs, which it calls \u201csignals,\u201d to predict the likelihood a reader will want to spend time with the story. \nThe publisher guidelines also highlight some of the company\u2019s policies around what types of content it allows, noting that \u201cgratuitous\u201d violence or hate speech are forbidden. Although it is not mentioned in the guidelines, Facebook announced in September that it would ban monetizing content that depicts violence and tragedy, even in the case of news. \nDuring the announcement, Mosseri also addressed a controversial test Facebook was trying in six countries, which separated some News Feed content from publishers into a secondary feed, limiting readership. \u201cI think we could have communicated it better,\u201d Mosseri said, but added there are no plans to expand the test and the company would not \u201claunch that as-is.\u201d \n\n"}
