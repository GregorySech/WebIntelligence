{"title": "Google's infamous manifesto author is already a hero to the online right", "content": " \nOver the weekend, an anti-diversity manifesto written by a Google employee went viral both within the company and outside of it, drawing harsh criticism from both present and former Googlers. But some agreed with the document, and alongside muted agreement from pockets within the company, the author seems to have found louder supporters in a more familiar place: the online right.\nThe author\u2019s name first surfaced in right-wing blogs early this morning. (The Verge has decided not to publish the employee's name; Recode reported he has been the subject of online threats.) The person identified by those blogs is a Google employee, and sources within the company indicate that his name is included on the circulated manifesto. \nThe Verge has not been able to contact the employee directly, despite multiple attempts. Google has not yet responded to a request for comment or confirmation of the employee's name and title.\nBut as executives within Google have rushed to criticize the document, a number of online outlets have come to the author\u2019s defense, often praising him by name. One outlet described him as \u201cthe only set of balls left\u201d at the company, while another said he deserved a bonus for calling attention to the situation. \nNovelist and anti-feminist pundit Vox Day has also applauded the manifesto as a corrective to social justice culture at Google, describing the company\u2019s relatively muted response as \u201creasonable.\u201d\nOn 4chan\u2019s /pol/ board, one user summarized the situation by adopting the language of Men\u2019s Rights, describing the author as a \u201cred-pilled\u201d programmer \u201ccomplaining about the blue-pills in the company.\u201d\nAn image circulating on Twitter photoshopped the author into a modern-day Martin Luther, nailing up his comments in the public square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original posting of the manifesto has been taken down, although it remained live as recently as Saturday afternoon.\nIt\u2019s not the first time a pushback against the tech industry\u2019s focus on diversity has spilled over into the broader right-wing. In September 2013, Business Insider CTO Pax Dickinson was forced to resign after a string of racist and anti-feminist tweets, which many believed put the company at risk of anti-discrimination lawsuits. In the wake of that firing, Dickinson joined with right-wing blogger Chuck Johnson to build information bounty service WeSearchr, before falling out with Johnson. Dickinson was banned from Twitter in 2016 alongside a number of alt-right and white nationalist accounts; he has yet to return to the platform.\nIt still remains to be seen what will happen to the manifesto author. Google\u2019s vice president of diversity, Danielle Brown, sent out a mass email condemning the document on Saturday, saying it \u201cadvanced incorrect assumptions about gender.\u201d\n"}
