At that moment I knew absolutely no one in the industry and could never have imagined that one day Ubisoft would ask me to take the world of Assassin's Creed and create an original story set in it as an anime series. If anyone tells you not to follow your passion in life they are wrong.\u201d \nAn original story set in the \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2019 world\nShankar\u2019s profile has been rising for the last few years. In addition to producing Netflix\u2019s upcoming Castlevania series, he produced 2012\u2019s Dredd and has worked on several genre shorts, like the grim and gritty Power/Rangers and the Man Bites Dog-inspired Venom: Truth in Journalism. \nUbisoft has yet to make an official announcement, and details on the project are currently thin. However, the company has been trying to get an Assassin\u2019s Creed TV series off the ground for years, right alongside its efforts to create a film adaptation. Last fall, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the company was in talks with Netflix to develop a show based on the games. Earlier this year, head of Assassin\u2019s Creed content Aymar Aza\u00efzia said on Reddit that a TV show was in the cards. With Shankar on board, the show is now one step closer to becoming a reality.\n\n"}
