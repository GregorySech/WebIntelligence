{"title": "This $100 Star-Lord helmet has built-in Bluetooth headphones", "content": " \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters later this year, and part of the oncoming wave of toys and tie-ins that Disney will be launching is this truly spectacular Star-Lord replica helmet. For $100, you\u2019ll get a light-up version of the glowing helm from the film complete with sound effects. Oh, and it\u2019s also a fully functional Bluetooth headset. So you can not only look like Star-Lord, but rock out in true Peter Quill style. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo they sound good? Probably not. At the end of the day, it\u2019s still a plastic toy helmet. But like the $100,00 diamond headphones, the Star-Lord helmet isn\u2019t about specs. It\u2019s about style. Throw in a fancy leather duster and some boots, and you\u2019re basically Chris Pratt. \nMost importantly, the helmet is sized to fit most adults. So grab your copy of the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix, Vol. 1, cue up \u201cHooked on a Feeling\u201d by Blue Swede, and get ready to save the galaxy. \n"}
