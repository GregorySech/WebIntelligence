{"title": "Google Daydream is getting a big software update and its own VR web browser", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s Daydream VR platform is getting its first major software revamp later this year, nudging the interface toward being a more full-featured operating system. The update, codenamed Daydream Euphrates, will roll out to all phones with Daydream support. As part of a larger move to support self-contained headsets that aren\u2019t powered by phones, it will add a 2D panel that pops up on top of virtual environments, giving all users better access to normal Android functions in VR.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind this is, we don't want to take you out of the VR experience if you need to check notifications or change a setting or pause or do whatever,\u201d says Mike Jazayeri, the Daydream director of product management.\nThe update adds more image and video sharing options, too. There will be a new screenshot and screen capture feature, and you\u2019ll be able to cast your screen live to a Chromecast-equipped TV \u2014 which means that people can see what you\u2019re doing in VR, similar to the \u201cmirror mode\u201d on desktop VR headsets. (For now, it\u2019s just local Chromecast-based streaming; you can\u2019t broadcast live gameplay sessions online with this option, for instance.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also going to be a version of Chrome that works inside Daydream. This gets a little complicated, because as some readers may remember, you could already access Daydream experiences through Android\u2019s Chrome browser. In that case, you\u2019d be navigating to a page normally on your phone, then launching WebVR-enabled experiences that you could view through Cardboard or Daydream. But with this new flavor of Chrome, you\u2019ll be able to literally browse web pages while in a headset, while also launching WebVR content.\nDaydream\u2019s not the first headset to have a VR web browser \u2014 Oculus launched one for Gear VR a couple of months ago, and Samsung had one before then. And this isn\u2019t exactly going to be most people\u2019s primary Chrome experience. But it\u2019s another way to keep people from having to take the headset off if they need to find something online. And if you\u2019re already using Chrome elsewhere, it\u2019ll import your bookmarks and other personalizations, like the normal mobile version.\nOn a slightly separate note, Google is also adding augmented reality features to Chrome for phones that support Tango. You could launch a web app that lets you preview furniture in your living room, for example, without downloading a full app. The AR browser options will be released in an experimental Chromium build today, so developers can check them out on Github, while the VR browser will hit Daydream this summer.\n"}
