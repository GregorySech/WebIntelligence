{"title": "UK startup Improbable raises $502 million to build huge virtual simulations", "content": " \nImprobable, a UK startup dedicated to building vast virtual worlds, has been valued at more than $1 billion after raising $502 million in a funding round led by Japan\u2019s SoftBank. The investment is the largest ever round of venture financing for a private British company, reports the Financial Times, and catapults Improbable into an elite tier of tech companies valued at more than $1 billion. \nThe startup was founded in 2012 by Herman Narula and Rob Whitehead, a pair of computer science graduates from Cambridge University. The company\u2019s aim is to provide software to run hugely complex and interactive virtual worlds. This digital infrastructure will be used to power vast video games and virtual worlds, sasy Improbable, but also the sort of complex simulations that will be useful to industry and government.\nThe first iteration of Improbable\u2019s software is called SpatialOS. As reported by Wired, it\u2019s currently being used to make a number of underdevelopment titles, including Worlds Adrift (an MMO built around flying pirate ships), and MetaWorld (think Second Life but in virtual reality). Improbable\u2019s promise is that SpatialOS will handle all the heavy lifting in terms of server support and technical infrastructure, allowing even small games studios to build sprawling, ambitious titles.\nThe real prize, though, is creating simulations of more complex systems \u2014 anything from the infrastructure needs of a large city, to the interactions of different drugs in the human body. As Improbable\u2019s chief executive Narula said in a press release: \u201cWe believe that the next major phase in computing will be the emergence of large-scale virtual worlds which enrich human experience and change how we understand the real world.\u201d\nFor SoftBank, the investment is the company\u2019s second big bite of the UK tech scene in less than a year. Last July, the Japanese corporation bought British chip designer Arm Holdings for \u00a324.3 billion ($31 billion). Before this latest injection of cash, Improbable also raised $20 million at a $100 million valuation from VC funds including Andreessen Horowitz, which also participated in this recent round of funding. \n"}
