{"title": "Apple put together a bunch of bite-sized iPhone camera lessons", "content": " \nApple\u2019s trying something a little different on its YouTube account today: rather than putting up more ads about how great the iPhone\u2019s camera is, it\u2019s published a series of short tutorials on how to actually use the camera.\nThe videos are all about 40 seconds long and focus on the very basics of iPhone photography, like using portrait mode and shooting panoramas. They also get into some general photography tips too, like how to shoot a decent photo in low light. These won\u2019t be useful for anyone but the most novice photographer, but that\u2019s still an awful lot of people.\n\nWhat might be most interesting about the spots is their style. They\u2019re all vertical, so they\u2019re meant to be seen on a phone. And they put together electronic beats and some basic text and graphics work for a vibe that Apple hasn\u2019t really tried before.\nThe spots are all going up on a new section of Apple\u2019s website, too, though the page appears to be broken right now.\nApple\u2019s camera advantage has vanished\nApple has been playing up the iPhone\u2019s camera in its ads for a few years now. But oddly enough, over those few years, the iPhone has lost the gargantuan photography advantage it once used to have.\nIn our latest test of the top phone cameras, my colleague Sean O\u2019Kane wrote that \u201cthe iPhone now feels a generation behind,\u201d with the camera regularly getting beat out by LG\u2019s G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, and Google\u2019s Pixel. The iPhone still has a good camera, but Apple\u2019s going to need to do more than just teach people how to use it to get back on top this year.\n\n"}
