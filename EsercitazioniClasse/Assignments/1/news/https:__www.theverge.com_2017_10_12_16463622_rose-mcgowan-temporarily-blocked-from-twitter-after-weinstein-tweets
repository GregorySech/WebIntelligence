{"title": "Rose McGowan temporarily blocked from Twitter after Weinstein tweets", "content": " \nActress Rose McGowan has been temporarily blocked from Twitter after denouncing the film producer Harvey Weinstein and his collaborators. Reports by The New York Times and the New Yorker published over the last week allege that Weinstein raped three women and sexually assaulted and harassed numerous others, using his influence in the industry to threaten and silence his victims. The Times reported that McGowan herself reached a settlement with Weinstein over undisclosed claims in 1997.\nFollowing the publication of these charges, McGowan has emerged as one of the most vocal denouncers of Weinstein. She has also called out numerous Hollywood figures that allegedly knew of his crimes and said nothing. She tweeted at Matt Damon asking, \u201cwhat\u2019s it like to be a spineless profiteer who stays silent?\u201d and, on October 10th, more simply: \u201cBen Affleck fuck off.\u201d She has also called for the board of the Weinstein Company to be dissolved following the allegations.\nThis morning McGowan shared a screenshot on Instagram showing a message from Twitter stated she has \u201cviolated the Twitter Rules\u201d and would need to delete certain tweets before the suspension would be lifted. After the tweets have been deleted, says the message, a 12-hour countdown will start before McGowan can fully use her account again. In the meantime, her account is still publicly accessible (unlike a full suspension, where all tweets are blocked from view). \n\n  \n  TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE. #ROSEARMY A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Oct 11, 2017 at 9:19pm PDT\n\n\n\nAfter being contacted by The Verge, Twitter said that it does not comment on individual cases \u201cfor privacy and security reasons.\u201d Update: An explanation was later provided in a series of tweets on the official Twitter Safety account:\n\n\nWe have been in touch with Ms. McGowan's team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. 1/3\u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future. 2/3\u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power. We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices. 3/3\u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\n\n\nFor critics of Twitter, this is only the latest example of the company\u2019s arbitrary and opaque enforcement of its own rules. In the past, it has suspended users for simply sharing threatening messages they\u2019ve received, while those reporting rape threats are told the messages do not violate Twitter\u2019s rules. \nDebate over what content is allowed on the site recently came to the fore after President Donald Trump tweeted threats at North Korea, which the country interpreted as justification for war. Twitter said that particular message did not violate its terms of service in part because of its \u201cnewsworthiness.\u201d Whether or not this was a consideration in the suspension of McGowan\u2019s account is not clear, but now is not the time for Twitter to quiet a woman who is specifically trying to break a culture of silence that allowed harassment to continue for so long.\nUpdate October 12th, 05:45AM ET: Updated to include Twitter\u2019s response. \nUpdate October 12th, 12:00 PM ET: Updated to include tweets from Twitter Safety account. \n"}
