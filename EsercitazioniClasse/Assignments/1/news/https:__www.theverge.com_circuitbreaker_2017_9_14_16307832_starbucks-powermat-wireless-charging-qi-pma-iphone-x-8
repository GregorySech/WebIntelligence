{"title": "Starbucks is updating its wireless chargers to support the iPhone X and iPhone 8", "content": " \nStarbucks\u2019 wireless charging pads are getting updated to support the iPhone X and iPhone 8, as reported by Chris Davies at SlashGear, who investigated the issue. \nIf you\u2019re wondering why this would be an issue in the first place, that\u2019s because up until now, Starbucks hasn\u2019t support the Qi charging standard that the iPhone 8 and X will use. Instead, when Starbucks started adding wireless chargers to its stores back in 2015, it partnered with Powermat \u2014 which provides power solutions for a variety of retail stores, as well as selling consumer charging pads \u2014 to supply the systems. However, Powermat\u2019s technology relies on PMA, the other major charging standard, which won\u2019t be compatible with the forthcoming iPhones. \nTurns out Starbucks\u2019 chargers are connected to the cloud\nTo solve that problem, Powermat will be rolling out an update to its charging pads in Starbucks (and other stores) that will allow them to charge Apple\u2019s newest iPhones. And while it\u2019s nice (if not super surprising) that Starbucks would want to update its charging pads to support Apple\u2019s newest phones, it\u2019s how the company is doing it that\u2019s interesting.  \nAs SlashGear notes in an interview with Powermat CTO Itay Sherman, the charging company\u2019s system is actually an elaborate, cloud-connected setup, with each wireless charger linked into a central system. That means that Powermat can push firmware updates to in-store pads, allowing the company to add Qi charging without requiring that stores like Starbucks physically replace all of its chargers. \nAccording to SlashGear, the update will be rolling out on a location by location basis, and while Powermat isn\u2019t confirming when that will actually be, it hopes to have it done by the time the new iPhones make their way into the world. \n"}
