{"title": "Trump\u2019s FCC is going to start moving much faster", "content": " \nWith the flurry of changes happening at the FCC over the past few months, it may be hard to believe that the commission has been short staffed the entire time. But since the beginning of the Trump administration, the FCC has been missing two key positions and the associated staffers that support them. Now Trump is about to fill in the gaps, and it means the FCC will be able to start accomplishing a lot more.\nThe Federal Communications Commission is supposed to be led by five commissioners (one of whom serves as chairman), but only three have been in place since late January. That\u2019s meant fewer people to deal with day-to-day regulatory issues, less expertise on the many technical questions the commission faces, and the potential for stalled votes, since a minimum of three commissioners is needed to approve new policies.\nAn old favorite returns and a new favorite moves up\nSoon, that should all change. Two weeks ago, President Trump nominated Jessica Rosenworcel, a former commissioner forced to depart in January when her term ran up. And just last night, he nominated Brendan Carr, who is currently the FCC\u2019s general counsel and previously served as a legal advisor to Ajit Pai before he was named commission chairman.\nBoth nominees still have to be approved by the Senate, which obviously has some high-profile issues it may want to attend to first. But when attention does come around to the nominees, it\u2019s likely that both will see confirmation at the same time.\nWith Rosenworcel, we know what to expect. She was on the commission for nearly five years before departing, during which time she was a fairly reliable liberal vote, a strong backer of net neutrality, an advocate for opening up new spectrum for Wi-Fi, and showed herself willing to break off when a well-intentioned proposal seemed to go wrong, as she did during the debate over opening up cable boxes last year. The FCC can\u2019t be staffed by more than three people of the same party, which is why Trump is nominating someone with such divergent views. Rosenworcel is the Democrats\u2019 pick, not his.\nComcast praises \u201cvast knowledge,\u201d Verizon praises \u201cdeep knowledge\u201d\nCarr we know less about, but he\u2019s pretty widely recognized as a qualified nominee. Businesses love him: Comcast referred to his \u201cvast knowledge\u201d and Verizon mentioned his \u201cdeep knowledge\u201d in statements commending the nomination. His soon-to-be peer, the Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn, said he\u2019s \u201cwell respected on both sides of the aisle.\u201d And Evan Swarztrauber, director of public affairs at the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, said in an email to The Verge that Carr\u2019s background \u201cshows that he is an accomplished and talented attorney who is well-versed in the most pressing issues facing both the Commission and the country.\u201d\nOf course, Carr is also being nominated as a Republican, giving the majority a firmer hold. Once three commissioners vote on an item, the other two are forced to take a vote, too, and Republicans can use that to move things along at a quicker pace. They also no longer face the threat of the lone Democrat on the commission skipping a vote so that an item can\u2019t go through.\nThat said, Clyburn has shown herself unwilling to abstain from votes just to delay the inevitable \u2014 like the passage of Pai\u2019s proposal to reverse net neutrality. At one point, she even criticized Pai for threatening to go around her and use what\u2019s essentially executive power to get something done, should she fail to vote. Voting, she said at the time, \u201cpreserved some degree of procedural integrity.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to be done on wireless spectrum.\u201d\n\u201cA three person commission has not prevented them from making policy,\u201d says Todd O\u2019Boyle, media director at the watchdog group Common Cause.\nSo even though the commission is being given a firmer Republican majority, there won\u2019t necessarily be a huge partisan impact once Carr takes his seat. Instead, having five commissioners in place will mostly just make it easier for the FCC to get its daily tasks done.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to be done on wireless spectrum,\u201d O\u2019Boyle says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very big broadcast merger in Sinclair and Tribune that the FCC has to review ... We just got through the [spectrum] auction pretty recently, so broadcast has to be repacked, spectrum has to be deployed by the wireless providers. So there\u2019s an awful lot that needs to be done and actually having a full compliment of commissioners means the FCC can do the work in the public interest.\u201d\nWhile the commissioners may come at high-profile issues like the Sinclair\u2013Tribune merger differently, most of these items are largely nonpartisan issues. \u201cSo much of the work is really about technical issues and meeting the needs of the American public,\u201d O\u2019Boyle says. \u201cI would hope that having a full complement of commissioners, each of which brings their own priorities and their ability to focus their staff on particular issues, would mean that we can see the agency executing on more consensus priorities.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no schedule yet for when the final two commissioners will head to the Senate for confirmation, meaning the FCC may continue as is for another couple weeks or months. While the FCC has already been able to push through big changes like its proposal to reverse net neutrality, assuming both commissioners get seated, it\u2019ll be far less hamstrung on the day-to-day issues that typically take up its staff\u2019s time.\n"}
