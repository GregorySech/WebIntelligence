{"title": "Republicans introduce resolution to kill FCC\u2019s internet privacy rules", "content": " \nRepublicans took the first step toward reversing the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s internet privacy rules today, with 25 senators introducing legislation that would reverse the rules and forbid the commission from passing anything similar to them in the future.\nThe privacy rules were introduced last year as an addendum of sorts to the 2015 net neutrality order. That order required the FCC to take over enforcement of privacy protection from the Federal Trade Commission, but the FCC needed to pass clear rules in order to effectively do that.\nThis is largely about sharing your web browsing habits\nThe FCC\u2019s rules mostly align with the FTC\u2019s privacy framework, but they differ in two key ways: the FCC makes internet providers protect your web browsing history, and the FCC has much more leeway to actually enforce its rules.\nOf course, neither of those distinctions are things that internet providers like. So they\u2019ve been fighting to overturn them.\nFor the most part, Republicans just want to see the FCC scale back its rules to more closely match the FTC\u2019s. At a minimum, that\u2019ll mean letting internet providers share your web browsing history so that they can make more ad money.\nIt\u2019s not clear how quickly Republicans intend to move on this, but, one way or another, these privacy rules are probably going down. Republicans can move forward with this legislation, which would require a majority vote in both houses and a signature from the president. Or they could wait around for the FCC to kill the rules on its own \u2014 commission chairman Ajit Pai has already indicated his plans to do that.\nSenator Flake wants the FCC to follow the FTC on privacy\nIn Congress, Republicans are relying on the Congressional Review Act to reverse the rules. The act allows recently enacted rules to be reviewed and reversed by a new Congress, and it\u2019s getting thrown around regularly as a way for Republicans to quickly undo many Obama administration actions from last year.\nThe big question, if the privacy rules are overturned by Congress, is what the FCC will do next. The law would prevent the FCC from passing any rules that are \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as the ones overturned, but it\u2019s not clear what\u2019ll qualify as different enough to clear that bar, especially since the changes Republicans are pushing for aren\u2019t very dramatic.\nAt the very least, Republicans have made it clear what they want the FCC to pass. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published earlier this month, Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who authored the resolution introduced today, said he wanted to scrap the current privacy rules \u201cin the hope that [the FCC] would follow the FTC\u2019s successful sensitivity-based framework.\u201d\n"}
