{"title": "Ringly exchanges gems for stones on its latest smart bracelet", "content": " \nRingly is launching a new version of its smart bracelet with an updated look, all the same features, and a lower price.\nThe new model is called the Ringly Go, and its biggest difference is its looks. The new model puts a large stone in the middle of a leather strap, instead of a large gem in the middle of a metal bracelet like most of the original models. It\u2019s a much more subdued look, and I think I like it more than the older design.\nIt\u2019s basically just a style choice at this point\nLike the first Ringly bracelet, the Ringly Go can be used as a fitness tracker and a notification device. It counts daily steps, distance traveled, and calories burned. And it can vibrate and light up to alert wearers to different types of notifications on their phone, like calls, reminders, and messages from specific people.\nRingly is also estimating a day longer battery life on this model: two to three days, instead of one to two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other big feature differentiator is the price. This one will sell for $125, while the original bracelet sells for $165. Given that they do all the same things, it\u2019s really just a style choice at this point.\nRingly is also going to be selling this model in some Target stores in the US, which should give the Go much more exposure and put it up against more familiar fitness trackers.\n"}
