{"title": "Google announces app updates to Allo, Duo, and Photos", "content": " \nAt its S\u00e3o Paulo event today, Google announced a slew of updates to its Duo, Allo, and Photos apps, including new calling capabilities, file transfers, and easier photo sharing.\nGoogle Duo \u2014 initially released last August as a mobile app for video chatting \u2014 will also offer audio-only calls on Android and iOS. The new feature is now available in Brazil and will be arriving \u201caround the world in the coming days,\u201d according to Google. (Of course, you can also make video and audio calls on a range of other Google platforms, including Hangouts and Voice, which recently received a long-awaited upgrade.)\nFor those with extensive document-sharing needs, Google\u2019s mobile messaging app Allo now allows Android users to share a variety of files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and .mp3) with their contacts. Unlike the rollout of the Duo calling feature, the update to Allo is available today worldwide.\nTo prevent that inevitable frustration when trying to back up or share pictures with a spotty internet connection, Google Photos boasts two new features for Android and iOS that allow for easier backup and sharing on low connectivity. Photos will be automatically backed up \u201cin a lightweight preview quality\u201d on slow connections then replaced with higher-quality images when a faster Wi-Fi connection becomes available. A similar dynamic applies to sharing: you can first send photos and videos in low resolution for immediate viewing, and the pictures will eventually be updated in higher resolution once a better connection is found.\nPer the press release, \u201cnever mind if you're at the beach or hiking in the mountains,\u201d you can still share photos instantly. For the less fortunate among us, this will probably come in handy when we\u2019re stuck on a crowded subway underground.\nToday\u2019s announcements came alongside the news that Google Maps will soon allow users to share their real-time location with friends and family for up to three days.\n"}
