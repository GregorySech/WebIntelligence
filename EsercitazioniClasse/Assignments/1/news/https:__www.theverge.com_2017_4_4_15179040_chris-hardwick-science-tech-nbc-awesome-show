The series, bluntly called The Awesome Show, will be hosted by Nerdist founder and Talking Dead host Chris Hardwick. \n\u201cThe opportunity to develop a primetime show that celebrates science and technology was too good to pass up,\u201d Hardwick said in a statement to Variety. \u201cIt is very important to me to make something that positively promotes these topics in order to share humanity\u2019s triumphs, to instill hope for our future, and to inspire the next generation of young thinkers.\u201d\nToo good to pass up\nWhile details on what the show will actually be about are scarce, Variety reports that the series will \u201cmarvel at mankind\u2019s tremendous feats,\u201d and feature stories about new scientific and technological innovations. \nIt might sound unusual for a show like this to get a slot on prime time, but Hardwick has a history of drawing eyeballs for NBC. He currently hosts the game show The Wall, which is the network\u2019s highest-rated unscripted launch of the year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \nThe Awesome Show doesn\u2019t yet have a premiere date scheduled. \n"}
