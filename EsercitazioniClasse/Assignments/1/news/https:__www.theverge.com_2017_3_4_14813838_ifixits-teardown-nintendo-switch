{"title": "iFixit\u2019s latest teardown takes a look inside the Nintendo Switch", "content": " \nWith the Nintendo Switch now out in stores, iFixit has torn one apart to see what\u2019s inside. One thing\u2019s for sure: it\u2019s quite a bit more complicated than the NES Classic Edition. \nWhile there\u2019s a bunch of parts to be taken apart, the tablet is the most interesting. Opening it up the team observed that it \u201clooks like a computer! Battery, heatpipe, thermal paste, fan. It\u2019s all there.\u201d iFixit noted that the 16Wh battery seemed to be a priority, but also that it wasn\u2019t something that a user could easily replace. They report that there\u2019s a number of components that can easily be replaced, such as the screen, the motherboard, antennas, and other components. \nThere are some pitfalls, however. Users need a special screwdriver to get into the main device, and the display is glued on, which requires some additional heat and prying. Ultimately, the site rates the Switch an 8 out of 10 when it comes to repairability. \n"}
