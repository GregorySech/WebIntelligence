{"title": "Oppo\u2019s next flagship phone has leaked out", "content": " \nOppo is planning on unveiling its latest flagship phone on June 10th, but whatever they announce won\u2019t be much of a surprise, thanks to an ongoing stream of substantial leaks. In the latest news that Android Pure has obtained are the official renders for the Oppo R11, and RayArena obtained a short video of a working version of the device.\n\nThe R11 will be available in at least four colors that we\u2019ve seen: gold, rose gold, silver, and black. Earlier leaks point toward the R11 being no slouch in the specs department either:\n\n5.5-inch 1080p display\nSnapdragon 660 processor\n4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage\n20MP dual camera system\n3,000mAh battery, fingerprint sensor\n\nSupposedly there will also be a bigger version, the R11 Plus, which will naturally come with a larger display and bigger battery. And with 10 days left before the official announcement, it\u2019s likely that the Plus may leak out as well. \n"}
