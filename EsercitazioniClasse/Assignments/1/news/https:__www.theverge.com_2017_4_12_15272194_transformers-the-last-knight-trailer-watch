{"title": "The big surprise of the new Transformers trailer is it looks kind of fun", "content": " \nI know I shouldn\u2019t be excited about a Transformers film because of a good trailer. The franchise has had great marketing in the past, carefully concealing the bloated melodrama, offensive caricatures, and puerile humor. And yet I\u2019m kind of, sort of, maybe a little bit intrigued by Transformers: The Last Knight.\nIt\u2019s not just this new trailer that has me seriously considering paying to see a Transformers film. My colleague Bryan Bishop spoke somewhat kindly of early footage shown at CinemaCon last month. A lot of the wild moments he described \u2014 knights, magicians, sentry droids, Mark Wahlberg dodging explosions \u2014 appear in this trailer, set to an almost laughably wrought score. \nPerhaps why I\u2019m optimistic is because this movie could be anything. There are at least five movies sold in the promo\u2019s diminutive runtime. It\u2019s a movie about King Arthur fighting alongside giant robots, a post-apocalyptic drama, a 1980s action kids movie, an unintentional Wahlbergian comedy, and of course, it\u2019s also the launching pad for the Transformers extended universe.\nThis movie will almost certainly be stuffed with the tacky, confusing fodder that stuffs every Transformers movie. But in this moment, I am eager to see it. I suppose this shouldn\u2019t be surprise. Michael Bay has always been the best at making commercials.\n"}
