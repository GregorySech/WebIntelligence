{"title": "Jaybird's Run wireless earbuds are ruined by unreliable Bluetooth", "content": " \nWhen a representative for headphone company Jaybird pointed to the thin silver band that wraps around the outside of the company\u2019s new truly wireless earbuds, I let out an \u201cooh.\u201d After spending the last couple years testing countless truly wireless earbuds, and finding them lacking far too often at maintaining a constant audio link with my phone, the idea of putting an antenna on the outside of the new $179 Jaybird Run earbuds felt like a novel and potentially solid solution.\nI was wrong about the second part. \nI\u2019ve spent the last few weeks using the Jaybird Run earbuds on and off during my commute to work, and every single time I have them in my ears I experience audio dropouts. Sometimes they come in fits and starts, leaving me with cherished minutes of uninterrupted listening, but the rest of the time the problem persists. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apparent flaw seems to stem from the fact that the earbuds use Bluetooth to talk to each other. When you make truly wireless earbuds, you don\u2019t really have a choice but to use Bluetooth to get the signal from the smartphone to the buds. But some companies use what\u2019s known as Near Field Magnetic Induction to connect the master earbud (the one that does all the communication to the phone) to the second one. NFMI is tricky to work with for a few reasons, but companies like Bragi have made it work well, and it does a better job passing through our thick, watery heads than Bluetooth. \nThe result of Jaybird\u2019s complete reliance on Bluetooth is an experience that\u2019s simply a mess. The right earbud seems to have no problem keeping the connection with my iPhone, but the left earbud constantly and inevitably loses its connection with the right one. When this happens, the result is often an aural oscillation as the earbuds try to put their audio signals back in sync with one another. It\u2019s as uncomfortable as it is inelegant, and it was the case with two different review units I tested.\nThe radio-heavy environment of a big city could be partially to blame, but that\u2019s no excuse \nJaybird\u2019s best guess at the cause of my trouble with the Run is the signal-heavy environment of a big city. This \u201cmany wireless radios\u201d problem is one that companies often like to cite as a reason for a reviewer\u2019s troubles. But it neglects the fact that other wireless earbud makers have had to solve for this problem in the past, too, not just Jaybird. Hell, even Boosted had to find a way to make its electric skateboard hang on to a signal in crowded spaces. Signal-rich environments might cause some of the trouble I experienced, but that\u2019s a factor that should have been well known going into a project like this, and it\u2019s no excuse for the device not to work. Customers shouldn\u2019t have to live with a product that doesn\u2019t work in a reasonable everyday setting and location. They shouldn\u2019t have to leave the city to use wireless earbuds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company also argues that the best-case scenario for using these earbuds is running, as implied by the name. Running means you might have your smartphone more exposed, or strapped to your arm, and in that case, the connection might be more solid. I would believe that, because the only time the earbuds have worked consistently well for me is when I\u2019ve clutched my phone in one of my hands.\nEven without these connection problems, I don\u2019t think the Run earbuds would be head-to-head competitors with Apple\u2019s AirPods or Bragi\u2019s The Headphone earbuds (that name remains the worst), two of what I consider to be the best options on the market. The Run earbuds feel cheap to the touch, and come in an equally plasticky (and bulbous) charging case that fits awkwardly in a pants pocket. Their design is a bit garish, though more forgivable when in all black. Pushing the buttons on each one can sometimes be uncomfortable as the action squeezes them deeper into your ears \u2014 though, to be fair, that\u2019s also a problem many other wireless earbuds have yet to solve.\nIf you like Jaybird\u2019s products, stick to the Freedom or X series earbuds\nThe Run earbuds are comfortable. Jaybird does a good job of including multiple tips and wings to help make sure the earbuds fit your ear without feeling loose (like AirPods do on me) or like they\u2019ve been hammered into place (like I felt using the Jabra Elite Sport). And the integration with Jaybird\u2019s app, which lets you customize the way the earbuds\u2019 sound, is as good a feature as it seemed when it was announced last year.\nThe connection problems I had are a total non-starter, though. Jaybird typically receives high marks for its around-the-neck wireless earbuds, and it even has a new pair of those that was announced alongside the Runs, the Freedom 2. So if you swear allegiance to the Jaybird brand, I\u2019d stick with one of those options. The Jaybird Run earbuds are an obvious first attempt at truly wireless earbuds that would have been bad two years ago when companies were still figuring out the basics of the idea. They\u2019re definitely not worth your time now that there are working options out there.\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nVerge Score\n\n\nJayBird Run\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nComfortable fit\nCustomizable sound\nSweat resistant\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nCompletely unreliable connection\nLackluster build quality\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $179.99 from Amazon\nBuy for $179.99 from Jaybird\n\n\n\nCorrection: The Jaybird Run earbuds cost $179, not $149 as this article previously stated.\n"}
