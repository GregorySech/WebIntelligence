This particular build will be released generally next month, with some reports suggesting the Windows 10 Creators Update could be available during April\u2019s Patch Tuesday on April 11th. \nDownload Windows 10 build 15063 ISO files\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade early and feel comfortable downloading an ISO file then you can simply mount the file in Windows 10\u2019s File Explorer and run the setup.exe to get the latest Creators Update.
