{"title": "Dubai\u2019s latest techno-boondoggle is a passenger-carrying autonomous quadcopter", "content": " \nResidents of the city of Dubai are reportedly getting a new toy this summer: a autonomous quadcopter drone capable of carrying passengers. According to a report from the Associated Press, the head of Dubai\u2019s Roads & Transportation Agency announced it would be testing the single-person quadcopter, made by Chinese drone company Ehang, as (in the words of the AP) a \u201ctransport alternative.\u201d \nThe drone in question was on display at an event during the World Government Summit, but attendees dismissed it as \u201cjust another curiosity,\u201d says the AP, until Road & Transportation head Mattar Al Tayer announced: \u201cThis is not only a model [...] We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai's skies.\u201d Al Tayer then said the craft would be flying by the summer, but did not give any other details. \n\nColor us extremely skeptical. Although Ehang has been showing off its self-flying drone, the Ehang 184, since CES last year, we don\u2019t have any hard evidence the thing works as advertised. We\u2019ve seen it fly, but not with someone inside, and even if Ehang did trust it with a human on board, that doesn\u2019t mean it would be able to safely navigate shared airspace, including managing taking off and landing. \nEhang\u2019s attitude toward marketing doesn\u2019t inspire confidence either: the company relies more on computer-generated footage and soaring soundtracks than real video clips of the 184 being developed. So far, this \u201cautonomous helicopter\u201d has been most effective in generating headlines for Ehang, which also happens to sell regular consumer drones.\nDubai\u2019s authorities, though, have a proven love of flashy gadgets. The city\u2019s police has a fleet of million-dollar supercars; its fire service has placed orders for unproven jetpacks for fighting blazes in skyscrapers; and the city has hyped up a vague partnership with hyperloop firm Hyperloop One. Announcing tests of an autonomous, person-sized quadcopter is simply par for the course; but don\u2019t expect too much in the future. \n"}
