Arrival, also based in the UK, has partnered with the postal service to operate nine trucks to deliver mail and packages in London and surrounding areas. The trucks are three different sizes and will begin deliveries today from the postal service\u2019s central London hub.\nThe electric vans are co-branded, have a range of 100 miles, and will produce zero emissions, according to the company. Arrival used to be called Charge and is run by Russian businessman Denis Sverdlov, known as the inventor of the Yota Phone, and as current CEO of motorsport championship Roborace. Arrival has a new factory in Banbury, and the electric vans are some of the first vehicles produced there. The company claims it\u2019ll be able to produce 50,000 vehicles yearly from the factory, using just AI and robots.\n\u201cCities like London will benefit hugely from a switch to electric, in terms of both pollution and noise,\u201d said Sverdlov in a statement. Arrival says the electric vans are the same price as diesel trucks, which makes the environmentally friendly vehicles more accessible.\nThe Royal Mail\u2019s fleet is currently comprised of 49,000 vehicles, and the trucks are known for their red color and cross bar logo with a crown, which have become pretty iconic. The new design, as described by Engadget, does look like a futuristic version of Postman Pat\u2019s truck. These are the trucks they\u2019ll be replacing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Terry Blackman / Flickr\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s Postman Pat\u2019s truck:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Gadget Show\n\n\n"}
