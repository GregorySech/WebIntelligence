{"title": "Donnie Darko in 4K: notes on a high-res fever dream", "content": " \nDonnie Darko is a midnight movie, but I saw the 15th anniversary 4K restoration at 9:30PM at the Metrograph, a two-theater art house on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. That\u2019s not where you want to see a movie like Donnie Darko. \nThe building doesn\u2019t remotely resemble a movie theater \u2014 no ticket window, no lights, no Art Deco design elements, no posters. It sits flush with the rest of the city block. The lobby sells air-popped popcorn in presorted clear plastic tubs, four different draft beers without names, and classic movie candy arranged artfully on a bookshelf with white backlights. The seats are assigned. Donnie Darko is currently playing in a theater with braided leather on the walls, and the rows of seats look like a stylish reinterpretation of Adirondack chairs. It\u2019s a super-fancy barn without the dirt. I\u2019m sure this is a lovely place to watch a documentary or a live-streamed opera, but on this night, in this context, it was at odds with what I was there to feel.\nIn a phone interview a few weeks before this high-profile anniversary release, the film\u2019s director, Richard Kelly, told me what he hoped the re-release would feel like, given that Donnie Darko\u2019s only true public life had been as a midnight movie, starting two years after its original release: \u201cI made this movie for the big screen, and so few people saw it in a theater when it first came out. So in some ways, it feels like the first time\u2026 We need to keep the theatrical experience alive and bring people together in movie theaters. Movie theaters are like churches to a lot of people.\u201d So his film\u2019s return to theaters was coming with some pretty high stakes \u2014 as urgent as God. \n\nIn the 15 years since Donnie Darko debuted in theaters, flopped, and was resurrected as one of the last true midnight movies for weirdos, Richard Kelly has never made another movie that anyone cares about. It\u2019s the main thing anyone knows about him \u2014 he somehow made Donnie Darko with a paltry budget of $4.5 million at age 25, and that was all he had in him. \nActually, Kelly had a string of truly impressive bad luck. Donnie Darko, a dark, disorienting science-fiction film about a plane crash, crawled into about 50 theaters in October 2001, with the country still reeling. Then the 2008 writers\u2019 strike hit just as the stars of his second film, Southland Tales, were set to start making the late-night TV rounds to promote it. The Box, his 2009 Cameron Diaz-led psychological thriller, prompted The New York Times\u2019 Manohla Dargis to dub Kelly a filmmaker \u201cas lost as his characters, trapped in a Pandora\u2019s box of his own making.\u201d So Kelly wrote a true-crime thriller as a vehicle for James Gandolfini, and then James Gandolfini died. I\u2019m not terribly superstitious, but Kelly seems... cursed. Which, for better or worse, ties in pretty well with Donnie Darko\u2019s tragic mythos. \n\u2018donnie darko\u2019 is better drunk, better sleep-deprived\nKelly\u2019s dramatic statements \u2014 \u201cThese high-resolution tools and projection can actually make you see the celluloid like you\u2019ve never seen it before\u201d \u2014 primed dramatic expectations for seeing Donnie Darko in 4K. The same way that recently snuffed candles or plain white bread trigger my memories of actual church, I wanted the tastes and smells of Donnie Darko on the big screen to call back the first time I saw it \u2014 at midnight, near Halloween, at the disgusting student-center movie theater for $4, with my belly full of pumpkin liquor. Donnie Darko is better when you\u2019re drunk, better when you\u2019re sleep-deprived, better when you\u2019re emotionally fragile or racked with anxiety. In college, I went to see it with one friend, both of us near-wasted and languishing in unrequited-love situations that felt so urgent and painful, we just might die. \nSo at the Metrograph, where I was too embarrassed to take a plastic bottle of rum out of my purse, and too recently emerged from the office to be in an interesting emotional space, I was disappointed \u2014 until the lights went down and Echo & The Bunnymen\u2019s \u201cThe Killing Moon\u201d kicked in. (That song has the same effect on me that the Star Wars intro has on other people.) I was, once again, stupidly thrilled. I\u2019m not prepared to say whether 4K makes a difference (Kelly promises it does), because legally I am supposed to wear glasses to drive and do not, but I can confirm that Donnie Darko is still gorgeous, moving, super weird, and really fun. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rarely ask why people love good movies, even though not all good movies are lovable. But why do people love Donnie Darko? Why do I? Kelly, who has presumably thought about it more than anyone else, said, \u201cSome things you\u2019ll just never really be able to know.\u201d But he\u2019s adamant that it isn\u2019t just nostalgia, or any feeling that the film might have a universal appeal. In 2000, he had to fight to set the film in 1988, and while he\u2019s glad that the recent tide of 1980s nostalgia projects is helping people find the movie, he\u2019s reluctant to be lumped in with it. Nor does he want Donnie Darko to be another film loaded down with Trump era political relevance it was never intended to have. \u201cI was really stubborn that it was a portrait of a very specific time in the American suburbs. The Reagan era was coming to an end, and The Last Temptation of Christ was being banned, books were being removed from schools, the War on Drugs, the birth of the self-help movement, all these things were happening in a very specific time.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cautiously credits its density. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of plot that takes time for people to unpack. It takes time for people to digest, and it\u2019s worthy of revisiting\u2026 When you make a film, you have to watch it hundreds of times. I wanted to continue to be stimulated by it when I watched it.\u201d Plus, he notes, the casting was \u201ca big factor,\u201d which I assume is code for \u201cbizarre.\u201d Patrick Swayze plays a deranged self-help guru, and Drew Barrymore plays a goth English teacher. \nThe notoriously complex (and flawed) plot explains Reddit\u2019s fascination with Donnie Darko, the ever-unfurling online contest to \u201cunderstand it best\u201d that crops up around pretty much all popular science fiction. Young, moody Jake Gyllenhaal (with his cute-boy Sambas and his near-constant bedhead) explains why Tumblr remains fascinated with the film. But that\u2019s today \u2014 not 2003, when the film originally took off as a midnight special. There\u2019s something else at play. \nthe whole thing is like a fever dream\nDonnie Darko has a melancholy and desperation that\u2019s hard to roll your eyes at, even when its delivery is corny or stilted. It\u2019s known as a portrait of teen angst, centering on yet another inevitably male-and-misunderstood \u201cchosen one\u201d hero. But watching it again in 2017, I realized most of the warriors against anti-intellectualism in Donnie\u2019s Virginia suburb, as well as every source of empathy or useful information in the film, is female \u2014 Mary McDonnell as Donnie\u2019s mom, Katharine Ross as his therapist, Drew Barrymore as his teacher, Patience Cleveland as \u201cGrandma Death.\u201d And while Donnie\u2019s overarching concerns are sometimes sloppily written, they\u2019re also a lot more profound than generalized angst or the dread of growing up. In an early scene, his therapist asks him if he thinks the world is ending. He responds, \u201cNo, that\u2019s stupid.\u201d But during the rest of the movie, he acts as if he does think it\u2019s ending, and his big question is actually whether it\u2019s stupid to care.\n(Public oddball Jake Gyllenhaal, in an interview with People magazine last year, said Donnie Darko is one of two movies he\u2019s proudest of making because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of things in there I believe about the world.\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morbid post-punk / new-wave soundtrack, the anywhere setting, the cold malaise \u2014 the whole movie is like a fever dream, which makes it more like a state to return to than a story to get bored of. It makes me nostalgic for the adolescence of my parents, whose interiority at that age I\u2019m never actually going to know. The movie is, as Kelly wanted, dated. But Donnie Darko is also funny, surprising, and deeply weird visually \u2014 all things it doesn\u2019t often get credit for, because the conversation is mostly about poking easy holes in it.\nOn the Metrograph\u2019s stupidly accessorized big screen, the composition of every shot feels intimidating. Kelly\u2019s vision of an American suburb is basically man vs. watercolor, with dopes and weirdos in sweatsuits or skeleton costumes, creeping around under a muted purple sky. The first minutes of my night were spent scanning the crowd for a real-life example of a heinous Donnie Darko tattoo, but the rest of it was spent knocked on my butt with admiration, after years of watching this movie mostly on a laptop. \nSo in my scientific opinion, thinking too hard about the story is a disservice both to Donnie Darko and your own happiness, because the movie works much better as a mood-poem and fugue state than it does as a science fiction mind-bender or even strictly a coming-of-age story. It\u2019s okay not to love Donnie Darko, but if you can wade through all the bullshit around it, it\u2019s still really fun to love Donnie Darko. Also, it does feel like church. \nThe 4K re-release of Donnie Darko is currently playing a limited engagement nationwide.\n"}
