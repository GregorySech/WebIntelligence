{"title": "Samsung's refurbished Galaxy Note 7 will reportedly go on sale in June", "content": " \nLast month, Samsung confirmed it would be selling refurbished Note 7 devices, and now we know where and when the phones will go on sale. According to a report from ET News (via SamMobile) the recycled Note 7 will be available in South Korea from three carriers this June. \nBranding and pricing are still being negotiated, but the handset will reportedly go on sale as the Galaxy Note 7 R with a price tag of around 700,000 won. That\u2019s about $620, or 300,000 won ($266) cheaper than the original. Around 300,000 units of the 3 million to 4 million Note 7 phones recalled in the region will reportedly go on sale. \nET News notes that the Note 7 R is said to have a smaller battery than 2016\u2019s Note 7 \u2014 3,200 mAh instead of 3,500 mAh. This is a rumor we\u2019ve heard before, and one that makes sense considering it was Samsung\u2019s difficulty fitting a large enough battery into the original Note 7 that caused the phone to explode in the first place. \nThis isn\u2019t an official announcement from Samsung, and these details may change. And don\u2019t expect to see refurbished Note 7 phones on sale in the US either. As Samsung said in March: \u201cThe objective of introducing refurbished devices is solely to reduce and minimize any environmental impact. The product details including the name, technical specification and price range will be announced when the device is available. Samsung will not be offering refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices for rent or sale in the US.\u201d\n"}
