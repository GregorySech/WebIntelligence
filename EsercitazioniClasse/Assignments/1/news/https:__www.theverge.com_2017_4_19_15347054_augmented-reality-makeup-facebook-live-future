{"title": "Augmented reality makeup is the future", "content": " \nWhen we think of augmented reality face filters, we tend to think of goofy novelties like Halloween masks, face swapping, or inadvertent racist caricatures. As Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out yesterday, AR could go far beyond that, putting objects in real space with sophisticated tracking tech. But if Facebook thinks of augmented reality as an integral part of its platform, there\u2019s one simple filter that\u2019s about to become incredibly useful. It\u2019s virtual makeup, and it\u2019s going to be great.\nBy \u201cvirtual makeup,\u201d I\u2019m not talking about meticulous airbrushing that can perfectly retouch your selfies, or some far-future tech for holographic glasses. What I want is simple: a flexible cosmetics filter that works on video messaging or Facebook Live. Think TV makeup, but applied by the camera, just convincingly enough that you\u2019d have to look carefully to notice.\nThis is real technology already, it\u2019s just a little rough\nAs someone whose job includes appearing on Facebook Live and Snapchat, AR cosmetics would fill a very particular need in my life. These quick social videos are one of the few times I regret never learning to put on makeup properly. I seem a little bit washed-out in them at the best of times, and I\u2019m usually filming at conferences and festivals, where I\u2019m fighting jet lag and a half-dozen strains of flu. I don\u2019t need perfection, but I\u2019d love to see a little color and contrast instead of looking like a sleep-deprived ghost.\nMost people don\u2019t have that precise problem, but there are plenty of situations where makeup is implicitly obligatory. This isn\u2019t good or fair; people just think of made-up faces as what women \u201cnormally\u201d look like, so deviating from that is considered slovenly. But while we\u2019re figuring out how to dismantle that system, we can at least make its requirements trivial to meet... at least for people who do a lot of FaceTime and conference calls, anyway.\nAnd to be clear, you can already use augmented reality makeup. Last month, we wrote about a partnership between cosmetics retailer Sephora and augmented reality company ModiFace, which lets people test products or see tutorials on their own face. The results look something like this: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect; as you may have noticed, some of my eyelashes are floating above my hair. But it\u2019s close enough that I could imagine using a more polished version on a real video, and even this limited system tracks my face pretty well. Of course, Sephora\u2019s tool isn\u2019t supposed to create a substitute for makeup \u2014 it\u2019s designed to show you what you\u2019d look like in real, fairly expensive products. But if companies like Facebook turn phone-based augmented reality into a serious, practical technology, that\u2019s bound to change. Modiface even announced live streaming support a few weeks ago, although it\u2019s still rolling out.\nIf AR actually sticks around \u2014 which is admittedly a big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re probably a few years away from YouTube makeup artists selling custom lipstick packs the way people sell iMessage stickers now. Big retailers will counter with free products that run ads on your mascara. You\u2019ll participate in brand activations that offer all those lipsticks from 50 Shades Darker. Maybe The Pirate Bay will have a makeup aisle. It\u2019s not as cool as the holo-clothing from Psycho-Pass, but it\u2019s one of the first meaningful steps toward it.\n\nOne day, we all just gonna wear holographic clothes\n\n\nI\u2019m not going to throw out my eyeliner, or give up on my eternal (and probably futile) quest for the perfect cat\u2019s-eye wing, because physical makeup application is a fascinating art. But it\u2019s something I want to do for fun, not rote obligation \u2014 the same way somebody might love driving, but hate commuting to work. So please, go ahead, Facebook. Give me a makeover.\n"}
