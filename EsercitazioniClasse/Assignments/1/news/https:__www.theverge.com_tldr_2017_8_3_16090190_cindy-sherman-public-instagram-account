{"title": "Cindy Sherman\u2019s newly public Instagram is a surprise, 600-piece online exhibit", "content": " \nOriginally noticed by Artnet, photographer Cindy Sherman suddenly has a public Instagram account with hundreds of posts. For fans of the photographer, it\u2019s kind of like a surprise show of new material. \nThe account has been active, but private, since October of last year. In the 590 images posted to the account, Sherman dabbles with some standard, banal Instagram behaviors like food photography, short videos of wild animals, and throwback Mother\u2019s Day pics. Those photos, and the ones of Sherman\u2019s pet macaw, a Katy Perry concert, and some  New Jersey Fourth of July fireworks could fit it on basically any Instagram account. \nBut they\u2019re mixed in with what appears to be new work from the 63-year-old artist, who made her name as an actress and model before kicking off a 40-year photography career pulling apart the male gaze, Western self-presentation, and the influence of pop culture on self-image. She\u2019s best known for her self-portraits, which often involve over-the-top costumes and makeup and elaborate distortions that render her face unrecognizable. \n\n  \n\nA post shared by cindy sherman (@_cindysherman_) on May 23, 2017 at 1:53pm PDT\n\n\n\nOn her Instagram, she\u2019s tooling around with stickers; fish-eye effects; bad, computer-generated makeup; lens flares; garish Photoshop with the general effect of a Snapchat filter; and, as is her habit, plenty of wigs. The wigs in these images seem to be added mostly digitally. \n\n  \n  Yum A post shared by cindy sherman (@_cindysherman_) on May 18, 2017 at 6:24pm PDT\n\n\n\nScrolling through, you might notice well-wishes and personal comments from Sex and the City actress Kim Cattrall, fellow famed pop artist and photographer Marilyn Minter, and singer Jenni Maulder, among other huge names from the New York art world. Intentional or not, Sherman\u2019s created another one of those seductively visible yet obviously impenetrable \u201cSuper Cool\u201d Instagram social circles. She hasn\u2019t given any comment on the choice to make the account public yet, or whether it constitutes a new project with specific aims. But for an artist so concerned with the demands that Western culture puts on faces, and the premium it puts on attention, it seems like a fitting platform. \nIn a New York Times profile last year, Sherman hinted that she might move away from still photography and into film, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of using myself, how much more can I try to change myself?\u201d Obviously she\u2019s found at least a few answers to that question. \n\n  \n\nA post shared by cindy sherman (@_cindysherman_) on Aug 2, 2017 at 5:12pm PDT\n\n\n\nThe profile\u2019s author, Blake Gopnik, also wrote at the time, \u201cThe deliberate shape-shifting that goes on in an Instagram selfie stream has roots in the infiltration of Shermanalia into our culture.\u201d If anything, it\u2019s odd that it took so long for us to see Sherman on a platform that, by nature, takes everything she\u2019s ever cared about to such an extreme. \n"}
