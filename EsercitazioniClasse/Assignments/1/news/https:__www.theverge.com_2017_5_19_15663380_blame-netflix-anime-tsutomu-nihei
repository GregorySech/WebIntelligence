{"title": "Netflix\u2019s new anime Blame! is an introduction to a dark science-fiction universe", "content": " \nIn the second season of Netflix\u2019s science-fiction anime Knights of Sidonia, there\u2019s a scene where the main characters gather around a television to watch another sci-fi anime. In it, a man named Killy, clad entirely in black, uses an obscenely powerful gun to destroy a strange, masked robot. One of the viewers, a human / alien hybrid named Tsumugi, becomes visibly distressed. \u201cWhat happens to Killy after this?\u201d she worries. \u201cIt all depends on our support,\u201d one of her friends answers.\nFor many viewers, it was a charming but not especially important scene. But for fans of Tsutomu Nihei \u2014 the creator of the manga Knights of Sidonia is based on \u2014 it was thrilling. Killy is actually the star of Nihei\u2019s first published work, the dark and gritty manga Blame!. His appearance in Sidonia lasts less than two minutes, but it made a strong impression. \u201cPeople were talking about this piece so much that we decided \u2018Why don\u2019t we do a movie?\u2019\u201d explains director Hiroyuki Seshita.\nThat film, called simply Blame!, releases on Netflix and in Japanese theaters on May 20th, 2017. For the most part, it\u2019s being created by the same team, including Seshita, who returned to direct, and Nihei, who was involved with the movie from its earliest stages. The Blame! manga debuted 20 years ago, and it\u2019s a story that has been updated and changed in many ways to better suit the new medium. \u201cIt\u2019s a body of work that [Nihei] restructured and redesigned and reconceptualized,\u201d says Seshita.\n\nBlame! takes place in the distant future, where humanity largely struggles to survive in a perpetually growing city-structure filled with dangerous robots called safeguards. The sheer size of the city \u2014 no one actually knows how big it is \u2014 means small groups of people have evolved in isolation, rarely interacting with each other. Killy serves as a sort of science-fiction gunslinger, travelling the countless levels of the city in search of humans carrying a rare gene that can help control the robots and restore humanity\u2019s place. It\u2019s a dark, hard futuristic tale filled with sprawling industrial wastes and disturbing humanoid killing machines.\n\u201cSometimes it was hard to follow.\u201d\nThough Knights of Sidonia and Blame! come from the same creator, and take place in the same, loosely connected universe, they take different approaches to storytelling. Sidonia is a character-heavy drama, with lots of humor and relationship-building to balance out the bleaker tale, where the last remnants of humanity are fighting a war against a seemingly invincible alien foe. Blame! is much starker and more mysterious. Killy rarely talks, and there\u2019s little explicit exposition. Sometimes many pages go by without words, and supporting characters rarely stick around for long. Much of the storytelling is purely visual. Readers learn about the powerful machines by witnessing them in battle, and see how humanity lives by observing their squalid villages. It\u2019s the kind of story that benefits from repeated readings to pick up all of the details.\nThis minimalist storytelling helps give the Blame! manga a distinct flavor, but it also makes it much less approachable compared to Nihei\u2019s later works \u2014 and that\u2019s something the team wanted to avoid with the film. \u201cHe knows that the original that he put together 20 years ago was a very complicated, intricate storyline that was aimed very much at anime and sci-fi fans,\u201d Seshita says of Nihei. \u201cSometimes it was hard to follow. For the movie adaptation, what Mr. Nihei wished for was to make something that was more accessible to a wider audience. Which was exactly what we wanted if we were going to put a movie together. That was very important for us to move forward.\u201d\nThe Blame! film gets around this by largely telling the story from the perspective of the human settlers of a small, isolated village. Desperate and running out of food, a group of townsfolk come across Killy after being chased by murderous safeguards while scrounging for supplies. Their stories intertwine when they learn of a factory that can potentially create both a large supply of food and a synthetic version of the gene Killy is searching for. Instead of breezing past these characters like in the manga, the film takes its time, giving the audience a chance to know and care for them.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still nowhere near as charming or lighthearted as Knights of Sidonia. There isn\u2019t much humor to the story. Killy is as quiet and solemn as ever, and there are plenty of long shots that show the impossibly huge scale of the city and its myriad levels of vast emptiness. But the new human characters help ground the story. They add an emotional weight as it becomes clear just how bad things have become, and what Killy is ultimately fighting to preserve.\n\u201cBlame! wouldn\u2019t be Blame! without that huge, massive structure.\u201d\nFans can still expect to see plenty of well-choreographed action sequences, unsettling robots scurrying to destroy humans, and far-out technologies like augmented humans and self-replicating food. And perhaps most important is the city itself, a strange place that\u2019s in a state of both decay and growth, as the machines expand and rebuild it in their image. It\u2019s every bit as stark and awe-inspiring in the film as in the manga. \u201cBlame! wouldn\u2019t be Blame! without that huge, massive structure,\u201d says co-director and CG supervisor Tadahiro Yoshihira.\nOne likely key reason the Blame! film captures the essence of the manga is because Nihei was so involved in the creation process. \u201cHe was there from the beginning,\u201d Yoshihira says. \u201cHe has a huge understanding of what we\u2019re trying to create visually, so there have been a lot of creative discussions.\u201d Seshita adds that \u201c[Nihei] looked back at what he had created 20 years ago, and he basically told us what he wanted to depict now.\u201d\nThe resulting film manages a very difficult and careful balancing act. On one hand, it\u2019s a fantastic piece of fan service, giving long-time readers a chance to see the world of Blame! in a new way. But it\u2019s also an ideal place to start for those unfamiliar with Nihei\u2019s works, which also include another loosely connected cyberpunk manga series called Biomega. \u201cThe movie is more like a door that welcomes people into this world,\u201d says Seshita.\n"}
