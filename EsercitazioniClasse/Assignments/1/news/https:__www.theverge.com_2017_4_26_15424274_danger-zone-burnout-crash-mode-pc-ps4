{"title": "Danger Zone is Burnout\u2019s \u2018crash mode\u2019 turned into an entire game", "content": " \nThree Fields Entertainment, an indie studio made up of ex-Burnout developers, is making a new game that looks a lot like Burnout 3\u2019s \u201ccrash mode.\u201d Called Danger Zone, the game is more of a puzzle game than a racer; the goal is to figure out how to create as big of a disaster as possible. You\u2019ll earn points by smashing more cars, and if you do enough damage you\u2019ll be able to turn your car into an explosive bomb for even more destruction. The game will feature 20 different crashing scenarios when it launches.\n\u201cWe are going back to our roots by creating a game in a genre we are truly passionate about,\u201d Three Fields Fiona Sperry says. Danger Zone will be the third release from the studio. It debuted with the similarly destructive Dangerous Golf in 2016, and followed that up with virtual reality shooting gallery Lethal VR. \"We wanted to go back to pure game making,\" creative director Alex Ward said of the decision to leave Burnout studio Criterion in 2013. (Criterion, meanwhile, has largely moved on to other franchises, including Need for Speed and the new Star Wars Battlefront. There hasn\u2019t been a new Burnout since 2011.)\nDanger Zone will be available in May on both PC and PS4.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
