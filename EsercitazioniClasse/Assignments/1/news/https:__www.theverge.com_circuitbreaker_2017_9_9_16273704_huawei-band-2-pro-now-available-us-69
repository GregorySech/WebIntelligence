The Band 2 Pro features the usual slate of fitness band features like a heart rate monitor, notifications, GPS, and a sleep tracker, along with a few extras that may make it a bit more appealing. \nThere\u2019s a running coach feature that can be personalized for your training program, or if you\u2019re running a race that can measure things like your VO2max and your recovery time. There\u2019s also a feature called relaxation training that will give you breathing instructions to help lower your stress level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Huawei\n\n\nConsidering the Band 2 Pro retails for only $69, it may be a pretty great deal if it lives up to its claims. The Band 2 Pro works with both Android and iOS devices and will last up to a week on a single charge. You can purchase Huawei\u2019s fitness tracker from Amazon today in black, blue, or red. \n"}
