{"title": "Frank Underwood campaigns for the presidency in House of Cards' new trailer", "content": " \nNetflix just released the first trailer for the upcoming season of House of Cards. In the clip, Kevin Spacey\u2019s Frank Underwood campaigns against Joel Kinnaman's Will Conway for a spot in the White House, and it looks like Underwood takes it. \u201cOne nation Underwood,\u201d Spacey says.\nIt\u2019s been more than a year since season 4 premiered back in March 2016, so fans have had a long time to reflect on an Underwood presidency. The US also got a new president in the interim between seasons, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the current political climate will play out on Netflix\u2019s most politically engaged show.\nThis will be the series\u2019s first season without creator and showrunner Beau Willimon, who has been vocally anti-Trump since the election.\nThe new season lands on Netflix on May 30th. \n"}
