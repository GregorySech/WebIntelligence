{"title": "Watching a TV show no one else likes has never been lonelier", "content": " \nIn 2015, when Netflix debuted Bloodline, I didn\u2019t think I was taking much of a risk by investing my time. Here was a moody crime drama set amid the lush visuals of the Florida Keys, starring Sissy Spacek, Friday Night Lights\u2019 Kyle Chandler, Broadway legends Sam Shepard and Norbert Leo Butz, and \u201890s cult icons Linda Cardellini and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. What about this show doesn\u2019t sound like a winning formula? Everyone, of course, would watch this show with me, I thought. It would be A Thing to watch Bloodline.\nAs it turns out, no, it won\u2019t ever be A Thing. After the third season (scaled back from 13 episodes to 10) drops on Netflix today, it won\u2019t be coming back. That\u2019s rare for a Netflix show, and puts Bloodline in weird company. The only other Netflix originals to be canceled so early are Hemlock Grove, Marco Polo, Richie Rich, and, recently, the extraordinarily expensive Baz Luhrmann joint The Get Down. \ni took a gamble on \u2018bloodline,\u2019 and i lost\nNetflix is infamously stingy with viewership data, particularly when releasing it doesn\u2019t function as a brag, but its renewal decisions seem to err on the side of \u201cwell, someone is watching it.\u201d There\u2019s no way that every original content experiment finds a huge audience, but almost all of them get lengthy runs, the kind reserved only for bonafide hits on traditional TV. The streaming company has now made four seasons of the god-awful Grace and Frankie, for no reason that I can glean other than Lily Tomlin\u2019s serial Emmy nominations. Fuller House got renewed, though critics far and wide called the first season a joke. Bloodline, on the other hand, has gotten mostly positive reviews and netted one Emmy win for Netflix last year (a supporting actor nod for Ben Mendelsohn). For it to get canceled, we can guess, there truly must be nobody watching it. Except me.\n(Netflix did not return a request for comment.) \nBloodline\u2019s tiny Reddit community gives us another hint that that\u2019s the case: the subreddit has 3,300 subscribers, many of whom post only to say that they aren\u2019t watching the show anymore. For reference, the subreddit for Better Call Saul, another good show no one watches, has 111,000 subscribers. But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not here to mourn the loss. Apart from, you know, enjoying the TV show, my main reward for sticking with watching Bloodline has been getting to make jokes about sticking with watching Bloodline. Though I love it, the show\u2019s cancellation doesn\u2019t disappoint me \u2014 it relieves me. Honestly: good riddance to Bloodline, a Dexter spiritual successor that stars many of my favorite actors and regularly thrills me. It\u2019s so lonely now, to watch a TV show that nobody else cares about. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Saeed Adyani / Netflix\n\n\nIn Superfandom, a 300-plus-page exploration of how fandom has evolved alongside the internet, Zoe Fraade-Blanar and Aaron Glazer write, \u201cThe image of a secret fan acting alone with no outside influence or interaction is largely a myth... True solitary fandom rarely survives for long.\u201d Mine might not even make it through Bloodline\u2019s final season. I know, because this has happened to me before. \nTaking it back to 2005 for a minute \u2014 the tail end of the era defined by Friends and ER, the last generation of shows that peaked with viewerships made up of double-digit percentages of the US population \u2014 the first \u201cgrown-up\u201d drama I ever obsessed over was Grey\u2019s Anatomy. It was a show that, as a middle school student, I should probably not have been allowed to watch. The only people I discussed it with were my parents, and, later, in high school, one co-worker at the mall food court. My friends did not watch it, and, at the time, I wasn\u2019t really using the internet for anything beyond the Kim Possible browser game and gossiping in Facebook Messenger. In the fall of 2011, I moved out of my parent\u2019s house, stopped working at the mall, and missed the season 8 premiere. \n\u201cTrue solitary fandom rarely survives for long.\u201d\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter that Grey\u2019s Anatomy went from objectively solid prime-time soap opera to a boring, tangled mess somewhere around that time. It wasn\u2019t why I stopped watching. I stopped because it was too lonely. Instead, I turned my allegiance over to AMC\u2019s Mad Men, a show that didn\u2019t even air a single new episode in 2011, but was nevertheless opined about in the Arts section of my college paper almost daily, and referenced constantly by my extremely hip contemporary literature professor. I watched so much of it, trying to catch up before season 5, that I got more than one email from IT saying I\u2019d exceeded my allotted campus internet usage for the month. (I was very cool in college!) Without really thinking about it, I gravitated to a show I thought would serve the same social function Grey\u2019s Anatomy had, back when my social world had been primarily my nuclear family. \nOnce upon a time, a television show was a one-way conversation, a thing that came into your house at a certain hour and, if you were there, you watched it. And if someone was else was there, then that was who you watched it with. Somehow, that felt like enough, though I\u2019m barely old enough to remember it. \nIn any case, appointment TV, beyond the Sunday night events that HBO has managed to make out of Game of Thrones, does not really exist anymore. You can always DVR or stream later. Bingeable Netflix series (aside from the mega-hit Stranger Things, unavoidable online and off for all of last summer) often feel like they exist in a space, completely separate from the rest of the world. The streaming-era practice of dropping a whole season at a time, with no schedule dictating when anyone watches each episode, means that even people who are fans of the same show aren\u2019t necessarily synced up in a way that lets them discuss it. (Hulu has recently tried to fight that with weekly releases of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. I fell off after episode 3, and I\u2019d love to see that viewership data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Saeed Adyani / Netflix\n\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy premiered just before TV culture fragmented endlessly and irreversibly, by way of premium cable, then streaming services, then Netflix\u2019s behemoth syndication catalog, then Netflix\u2019s daunting roster of original content... then Netflix competitors\u2019 rosters of original content. All that happened alongside most of cable TV realizing that specificity and diversity could be profitable, that making many shows with smaller, fiercer fan bases could be as valuable (and much easier) than making one hit that appealed to everyone. More importantly, it was before the height of live-tweeting, Tumblr fandom, Reddit communities, weekly online recaps, and critical analysis that can be as fun and interesting in themselves as the TV shows they engage with. All of the extras that make a piece of entertainment feel like something more, something participatory. We expect those now.\nSince 2012, Netflix has gone from a DVD-rental service with four pieces of fledgling original content to a production giant with well over 100. All of these changes pull at each other. From one side, the promise that the internet will always provide a fan community for anything you could possibly want to be a fan of, and on the other side, a content creator with an output that has grown over 3,000 percent in five years, splintering the zeitgeist further with each new well-made offering. And that\u2019s just one company. \nAm I crazy? Does this show only exist in my mind? \nAs a result, \u201cAm I the only one watching this show?\u201d has become its own genre of writing, defined by a tone of \u201cAm I crazy? Does this show only exist in my mind?\u201d and pleading, sales-pitch language. \u201cWhy is nobody watching Schitt\u2019s Creek with me?\u201d; \u201cWhy did audiences forget Better Call Saul so quickly?\u201d; \u201cObsessed: Am I the only one watching this show?\u201d; \u201cThe Americans is the best show on TV. So why isn\u2019t anyone watching it?\u201d; \u201cWhy is nobody watching ABC\u2019s critically acclaimed drama Nashville?\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst is the best TV show you\u2019re not watching\u201d; \u201cHBO\u2019s The Leftovers is the best TV show you\u2019re not watching\u201d; \u201cAm I the only one still watching Empire?\u201d It never stops. \nIt\u2019s not always clear why a just-okay show like Stranger Things takes off in the popular imagination and an also-okay show like Bloodline doesn\u2019t. But entire TV shows now function like viral videos \u2014 endless options and endless conversation about which of these options is worth the time means a little bit of buzz turns into a lot of buzz if it happens at the right moment \u2014 but if the timing\u2019s off, it goes mum. It\u2019s a much more fickle environment than the already distant-feeling era of Breaking Bad and Mad Men, when a show could assemble a reputation and audience slowly, brick-by-brick. You can easily bet wrong, like me, and find yourself here, counter-intuitively wishing your favorite show would disappear and give you some peace. \nWatching something alone has never been more likely, and \u2014 now that we\u2019ve come to expect community and discussion and blogs and backchannel for everything we care about \u2014 it\u2019s never been lonelier. We\u2019re social creatures. We want to share things with people! And in a TV environment with infinite options, we want to be affirmed that the choices we\u2019ve made represent good taste. \nWhen a TV show provides neither, it\u2019s awfully hard to hang on. \n\n\n\n\n"}
