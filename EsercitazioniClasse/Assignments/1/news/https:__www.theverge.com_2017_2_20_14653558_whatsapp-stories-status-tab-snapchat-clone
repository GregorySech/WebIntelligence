{"title": "WhatsApp is the latest Facebook product to clone Snapchat stories", "content": " \nHere\u2019s another gift from Facebook to Snapchat on the latter\u2019s road to an initial public offering: WhatsApp has cloned Snapchat\u2019s popular stories format and is using it to replace its old text-based status messages. The feature begins rolling out to WhatsApp\u2019s billion-plus users today on Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone.\nAs on Snapchat, WhatsApp stories are posted from an in-app camera. Once you\u2019ve taken a photo, you can adorn it with drawings, text, and emoji. Once you post your story, it appears in a new \u201cstatus\u201d tab, where your contacts can view it for the next 24 hours. You can reply to friends\u2019 updates directly from the post.\nWhatsApp becomes the fourth Facebook product to clone Snapchat stories. Instagram was the first, in August. It was followed by Facebook Messenger and then Facebook itself, both of which are still testing the feature in a small number of countries. WhatsApp is Facebook\u2019s second product to roll the feature out globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp positioned the update as a gift to users on its 8th birthday, and a kind of symbolic return to its origins. \u201cWhen WhatsApp launched nearly 8 years ago (on Feb. 24th), it started as an app for sharing status updates, where people could type a short line of text to let their friends know what they were up to,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cWhen we noticed people were using the feature to communicate in real time, we redesigned WhatsApp as a messaging app.\u201d\nA strategic effort to blunt Snap\u2019s momentum\nOf course, if status updates were that important to the company, presumably it would have enhanced them some time in the past eight years. Instead, Snapchat arrived and began swallowing up large chunks of the younger demographic, instilling an existential terror in Facebook that has transformed its product roadmap over the past year.\nFrom Facebook\u2019s perspective, adding stories to WhatsApp represents a strategic effort to blunt Snapchat\u2019s growth in markets where the ephemeral messaging app has yet to take root. By implementing one of Snapchat\u2019s most popular features across its dominant suite of social apps, Facebook is forcing Snap Inc. to find new ways to grow its business.\nAnd it could very well work. Within four months of launching, 150 million people were using Instagram stories every day \u2014 about the same amount that use Snapchat. WhatsApp stories give Snap one more thing to worry about. Its IPO is scheduled for March 2nd.\n"}
