{"title": "A proper Pok\u00e9mon game is coming to the Nintendo Switch", "content": " \nA new Pok\u00e9mon game is in the works for the Switch, Nintendo revealed today at its E3 Spotlight presentation. And unlike the recently announced Pokk\u00e9n Tournament DX, the upcoming title is a proper \u201ccore\u201d RPG Pok\u00e9mon game from developer Game Freak, who has developed every title in the main Pok\u00e9mon series since the original release of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue back in 1996. \nThe news comes on the heels of Nintendo\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon-themed Direct presentation last week, which to the disappointment of many fans, saw an announcement of Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon for the Nintendo 3DS, leaving the Switch with only an upgraded port of Pokk\u00e9n Tournament from the Wii U. \nIt\u2019s unclear whether or not the Switch Pok\u00e9mon game is the long-rumored Pok\u00e9mon Stars \u2014 said to be a port of the existing Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon from the 3DS \u2014 or a new entry in the series. In any event, it will mark the first time in the history of the series that a \u201cmain\u201d Pok\u00e9mon RPG title is coming to a home console. (Given the Switch\u2019s portable nature, however, that title may be up for debate.)\nNintendo didn\u2019t give any more information on the upcoming game, except to note that it won\u2019t be released until sometime next year at the earliest. \n"}
