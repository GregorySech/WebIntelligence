{"title": "GPS will be accurate within one foot in some phones next year", "content": " \nSmartphones\u2019 GPS systems are going to start getting a lot more accurate. According to IEEE Spectrum, Broadcom is starting to make a mass-market GPS chip that can pinpoint a device\u2019s accuracy to within 30 centimeters, or just under one foot. That\u2019s compared to today\u2019s GPS solutions, which typically have a range of three to five meters, or up to 16 feet away.\nThat relatively large error range is what can make it so hard for your phone to tell if you\u2019re on a highway or an offramp, or if you\u2019ve made a turn or continued forward. This new generation of GPS chips is supposed to solve those problems, and Broadcom reportedly told IEEE Spectrum that its new chips will start appearing in some smartphones next year \u2014 though it declined to say which ones.\nMore accuracy in cities, too\nThe improved accuracy is thanks to a newer GPS satellite broadcast that gives your phone additional information it can use to refine your position. Broadcom tells IEEE Spectrum that there are now 30 satellites that support the new standard next year the \u201cright moment to launch.\u201d\nIn particular, the new GPS tech is supposed to be a big help in cities, because it can avoid issues that come up due to signals getting reflected off of big buildings. GPS is often less accurate in dense urban locations, so people living in cities may see the biggest benefits from this new generation of chips.\nIt\u2019s not clear quite how quickly this new GPS tech is going to spread, though. Even though Broadcom says its chips will end up in some phones next year, those likely won\u2019t be incredibly popular devices like the iPhone. Qualcomm is the biggest name in GPS chips, according to ABI Research. And since Qualcomm supplies modems for most major phones \u2014 the iPhone included (for now, at least) \u2014 this feature isn\u2019t likely to roll out widely next year. Chances are, we\u2019ll have to wait for Qualcomm to build its own version.\n"}
