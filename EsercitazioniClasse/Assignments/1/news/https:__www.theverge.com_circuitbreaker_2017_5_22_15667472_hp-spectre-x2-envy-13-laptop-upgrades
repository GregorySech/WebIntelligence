{"title": "HP\u2019s Surface competitors are getting even better", "content": " \nHP is announcing a handful of laptop upgrades today, but two stand out for going head to head with Microsoft\u2019s Surface line. The first is an upgrade of HP\u2019s Spectre x2, making it into a more capable Surface Pro competitor. And the second is a slimmed down Envy 13 that makes the laptop look like it could be a better MacBook Air alternative than the Surface Laptop.\nThe Spectre x2 \u2014 a tablet with a detachable keyboard case \u2014 was pretty well received when it was introduced two years ago, but it had one big drawback: it could only be configured with Intel\u2019s Core m processors. That made the Spectre x2 a far less powerful device than the Surface Pro, or really just a typical laptop, and HP says it heard that customers wanted more. So it\u2019s updated the machine this year to use Core i processors \u2014 real ones, not the Core m-style processors that Intel decided to rename Core i last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upside of this is that the Spectre x2 should be capable of doing more than just casual web browsing. The downside is that it might run a bit hotter, it now includes a fan (which will make it louder), and it\u2019s going to have shorter battery life. HP is estimating just eight hours this year, down from 10 hours on the original model. The tablet has also gotten a little bit thinner, and HP has cut down its bezels so it looks better overall.\nHP is also updating a few other specs. The tablet still has a 12-inch display, but now it has a 3000 x 2000 resolution, up from 1920 x 1280 on the original. This model comes with a 360GB SSD, instead of a 128GB SSD. And the tablet\u2019s two USB ports have been switched to USB-C.\nWhile there\u2019s no one game-changing upgrade here, these all add up to put the Spectre x2 into a much more premium space, where it\u2019ll have an easier time going head to head with the Surface Pro. It\u2019ll go on sale next month with a starting price of $999.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other big release from HP today is a new Envy 13 laptop. It\u2019s a metal laptop that\u2019s essentially HP\u2019s answer to the MacBook Air. This year, its bezels have been narrowed down quite a bit so that the whole laptop is about 0.8 inches narrower and 0.4 inches shorter. At it actually looks a bit like Dell\u2019s XPS 13, which makes sense since it\u2019s competing in the same space.\nHP had already refreshed the Envy 13 with Kaby Lake processors, so the rest of the specs are staying pretty much the same here. It has a 13.3-inch 1080p display, a 128GB SSD (the old model started at 256GB), 8GB of RAM, and an estimated 14 hours of battery life. The new model also ditches HDMI to add an extra USB-C port, so there are now two USB-C ports and two traditional USB 3 ports.\nThe laptop looks nice and feels sturdy. And while it isn\u2019t as immediately catchy as the Surface Laptop, it feels like HP has a solid answer to Microsoft\u2019s latest challenger. The Envy 13 starts at $1,049.99 and includes full Windows 10.\nThose are the two big changes to HP\u2019s lineup today, but it actually has two other laptops that it\u2019s updating as well. The Envy 17 is now a little bit thinner and comes with discrete graphics, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce 940MX, by default. And the Envy x360 15 is getting updated with slimmer bezels, making the whole machine a little bit smaller.\nCorrection May 22nd, 2:56PM ET: This article initially referred incorrectly to the Spectre x2 as the Elite x2 and the Envy 13 as the Elite 13 in several locations. We regret the errors.\nCorrection May 24th, 1:35PM ET: The Spectre x2 does have a fan, unlike what an HP representative initially told us, and is thinner than its predecessor, not thicker, as the company\u2019s press material initially indicated.\n"}
