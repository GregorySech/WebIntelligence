{"title": "Facebook will allow paywalled Instant Articles later this year", "content": " \nFacebook is adding the option for publishers to lock Instant Articles shared on the social media service behind a paywall later this year, said Campbell Brown, the company\u2019s head of news services, at a conference yesterday according to The Street. \nPublishers will be able to lock out users after 10 articles in a month\nThe new feature will reportedly be built on top of the company\u2019s existing Instant Articles feature. Publishers will be able to direct users to sign up for a digital subscription or to lock out readers after they\u2019ve read 10 articles in a month, similar to the limitations that publications like The New York Times already place on their websites. \nAccording to Brown, the new subscription option is in response to requests from publishers who have been lobbying the company for a paywall for shared articles on Facebook. The new subscription service will reportedly begin tests in October, although details are still slim \u2014 including whether or not Facebook will share in the revenue from subscriptions purchased through the application.\n"}
