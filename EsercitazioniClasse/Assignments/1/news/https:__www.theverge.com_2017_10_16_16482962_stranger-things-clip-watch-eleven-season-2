 We’re still two weeks out from Stranger Things’ season 2 premiere, but Netflix just released a new clip that should hit that sweet spot of dark, gooey, monster mystery until then. The new scene above is short, but it gives us a pretty good look at the murky world of The Upside Down, and what it’s like to crawl out of it. In the clip, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sees a hole in the wall of The Upside Down and fights her way through a sticky, slimy goo until she lands back in the halls of Hawkins High.  As io9 points out, Eleven’s head is still shaved in this clip, which is a good indicator that the scene takes place soon after she fell into The Upside Down at the end of season 1. Stranger Things comes back on October 27th.
