{"title": "Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is launching in August", "content": " \nThe next big Uncharted adventure is coming this summer. Today developer Naughty Dog announced that Uncharted: The Lost Legacy will be launching on PS4 on August 22nd. First unveiled last December, The Lost Legacy is a standalone spinoff that is the first in the series to not star hero Nathan Drake, who ended his treasure-hunting career in last year\u2019s Uncharted 4. Instead, the new game will see players control co-leads Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross. While it\u2019s not a numbered, main entry in the series, The Lost Legacy appears to be a fairly big experience. Naughty Dog creative director Shaun Escayg describes it as \u201cas a true Uncharted game \u2014 complete with its own deep narrative with complex character development, all-new destinations, refined gameplay, and blockbuster cinematic moments.\u201d You can get a better idea of what to expect in the just-released trailer above.\n"}
