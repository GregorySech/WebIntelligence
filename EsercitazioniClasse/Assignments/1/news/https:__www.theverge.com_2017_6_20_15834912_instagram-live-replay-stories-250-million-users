{"title": "You can now save your Instagram live streams to replay for 24 hours", "content": " \nInstagram today is rolling out the option of saving your public live broadcasts to your Instagram story, where they can be replayed by your followers for the next 24 hours. Starting today, you can tap \u201cshare\u201d after your broadcast has ended to add it to your Instagram story \u2014 or tap the toggle button to discard it. It\u2019s a new feature for Instagram stories, which the company said today has 250 million daily users \u2014 up from 200 million in April. And it represents a new effort to kick-start a format that seems to have stalled across every social network.\nAmong the big live-streaming players, Instagram\u2019s ephemeral streams are unique. As soon as you stop broadcasting, your video disappears forever. (Twitter\u2019s Periscope started off this way, but eventually began enabling replays by default.) Instagram says average users are more comfortable making videos when the videos go away. But they don\u2019t seem to be making those videos in large numbers \u2014 the company says only that \u201cmillions of people have used\u201d the live-streaming feature, and hasn\u2019t shared any other details \u2014 including how many of those millions ever used it more than once.\nUsers seem equally indifferent to live-streaming on Facebook, Instagram\u2019s parent company. Facebook streams are saved to the profile by default, and despite a massive marketing campaign behind it, Facebook Live is still best known for intermittent broadcasts of police brutality and self-harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving broadcasts for 24 hours represents an intriguing middle path for live streaming. The video will last long enough for your closest friends to see it \u2014 they\u2019re the ones who are checking your stories every day, after all \u2014 but disappears before it can come back to haunt you. \nMaybe that helps Instagram build a critical mass of users \u2014 or maybe not. For a few months in 2015, it seemed as if live broadcasts would overtake social mediain the United States. But they didn\u2019t, and the reason does not appear to be the length of time the videos were available for consumption. It has more to do with the question of why a person would broadcast in the first place. What makes a person want to talk with a random subset of their friends on a regular basis? It\u2019s a question that that the big platforms have so far had enormous trouble answering. But the fact that no one has yet figured it out only gives companies like Instagram more reason to keep trying. \n"}
