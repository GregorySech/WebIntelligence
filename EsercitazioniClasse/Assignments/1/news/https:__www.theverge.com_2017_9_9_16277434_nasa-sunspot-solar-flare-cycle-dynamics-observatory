{"title": "The Sun has produced a whole bunch of solar flares this week", "content": " \nWhile the hurricanes popping up in the Atlantic has captured everyone\u2019s attention, the Sun has had its own active week as well. A total of six solar flares have erupted from the same active sunspot since Monday \u2014 including the largest flare the Sun has produced in its current cycle.\nSunspots are cool, dark regions on the Sun\u2019s surface with strong magnetic fields. These solar phenomena pop up on the Sun from time to time, sometimes relatively frequently. In fact, the Sun has a roughly 11-year sunspot cycle \u2014 the result of the its changing magnetic field. Magnetic material inside the Sun is always moving and rising to the surface, and it eventually causes the Sun\u2019s north and south poles to flip. Because of this, the Sun alternates between two periods: solar maximum \u2014 when sunspots are much more frequent on the Sun\u2019s surface \u2014 and solar minimum \u2014 when the Sun\u2019s surface is relatively sunspot free.\nthe largest flare the Sun has produced in its current cycle\nRight now the Sun is actually on the downswing, heading toward solar minimum. But NASA says sunspots can still form on the Sun, and they can sill lead to powerful solar flare eruptions. These flares don\u2019t pose any significant threats to Earth, but they can mess with our power systems. Flares are associated with something called coronal mass ejections, when high-energy plasma is sent out into space. When this reaches Earth, the plasma interacts with the magnetic field and particles surrounding our planet, causing geomagnetic storms that can impact satellites and even electronics on the ground.\nThe biggest flare to erupt from this active sunspot occurred on September 6th, and apparently the radio blackout that it caused has already passed. Check out the flares below, thanks to observations from NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory \u2014 a satellite that has been monitoring the Sun since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo solar flares were emitted on September 6th, including the X9.3 flare \u2014 the most powerful in the current solar cycle.\nNASA/GSFC/SDO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two September 6th solar flares, with Earth to scale.\nImage: NASA/GSFC/SDO\n\n\n\n"}
