{"title": "Twitter just doubled the character limit for tweets to 280", "content": " \nThe tweets in your timeline are about to get super-sized. Twitter said today that it has started testing 280-character tweets, doubling the previous character limit, in an effort to help users be more expressive. \u201cOur research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people tweeting in English,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people Tweeting \u2014 which is awesome!\u201d\nAbout 9 percent of all tweets today are exactly 140 characters, Twitter says. It\u2019s tough to do that on accident, suggesting that users frequently have to edit their initial thoughts to get them under the limit. (It\u2019s certainly true for me.) Now Twitter hopes to ease that burden by doubling the character limit in what it calls \u201clanguages impacted by cramming,\u201d which includes every language except for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. \nUsers frequently have to edit their initial thoughts to get them under the limit\nThe rationale for excluding those languages is that users can fit more thoughts into fewer characters given the nature of their written language. The average length of a tweet in Japanese is 15 characters, and only 0.4 percent of tweets hit the 140-character limit, Twitter says. Still, the company said it is open to revisiting the subject of expanded tweets for Asian languages as it learns more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 140-character limit was originally established to reflect the length of SMS messages, which was how tweets were distributed prior to the development of mobile apps. SMS messages are limited to 160 characters; Twitter reserved the remaining 20 for the username. As often happens in creative mediums, the constraint spurred creativity, and Twitter became a fast-moving, newsy, jokey, weirdo playground.\nTwitter has considered expanding the tweet length for years. By the end of 2015, the company was moving closer toward introducing tweets of up to 10,000 characters, company sources told The Verge. It was being developed simultaneously with a new ranked timeline, which would depart from the purely chronological feed in favor of one that attempted to show users the best tweets first.\nTwitter once considered tweets of up to 10,000 characters\nWithin the company, both moves were controversial. Twitter\u2019s identity has always derived from its real-time nature and the brevity of its messages; 10,000-character tweets shown in a Facebook-style feed threatened to confuse the product. Ultimately, the company arrived at a series of compromises. In 2016, it introduced an optional ranked timeline that showed \u201cthe best tweets first,\u201d followed by tweets in the standard reverse-chronological order. It also expanded tweets by not counting media attachments against the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubling the length of tweets, then, is a radical step, but it\u2019s a much less radical one than others the company has previously considered. (Others have gone further \u2014 Twitter clone Mastodon launched with 500-character messages.) \nCan 280 characters avert global nuclear war?\nStill, super-sized tweets are likely to change the nature of the network as more people gain access to them, and in unpredictable ways. Will those multi-message \u201ctweetstorms\u201d shrink into a smaller number of tweets, or will the expanded real estate encourage people to write even more? What new kinds of jokes and memes are possible at 280 characters that were not possible at 140? Will 280 characters allow for just enough nuance and diplomacy that we may be able to avert global thermonuclear war? \nWe\u2019ll soon find out. Most Twitter applications should already be able to show longer tweets, thanks to changes that the company introduced to its API last year. You\u2019ll know you have expanded tweets if the character counter at the bottom right-hand corner of the composer looks like a circle. It will count down from 280 until you run out of room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters \u2014 we felt it, too,\u201d the company said in its blog post. \u201cBut we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint. We are excited to share this today, and we will keep you posted about what we see and what comes next.\u201d\nI asked to interview Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about the big change, but Twitter said no. \n\n\nThis is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit. Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet. And at the same time maintaining our brevity, speed, and essence! https://t.co/TuHj51MsTu\u2014 jack (@jack) September 26, 2017\n\n\n\nCorrection, 6:06 p.m.: This article originally misstated the percentage of tweets that hit the 140-character limit. It is 0.4 percent, not 0.9 percent.\n"}
