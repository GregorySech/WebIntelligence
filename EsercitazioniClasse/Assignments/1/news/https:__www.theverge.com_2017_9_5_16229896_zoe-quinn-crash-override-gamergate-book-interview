{"title": "Zoe Quinn wants us to build better communities, joke about sex, and save the internet", "content": " \nGame developer Zoe Quinn has an unusually varied list of achievements. She\u2019s the creator of non-traditional text adventure Depression Quest, and one of the best-known DIY cyborgs. She\u2019s a co-founder of anti-harassment organization Crash Override, and she\u2019s currently working on a full-motion video dating game with absurdist erotica author Chuck Tingle. But since 2014, her work has often been overshadowed by Gamergate: the bitter, manufactured controversy over \u201cethics in games journalism\u201d started by Quinn\u2019s vengeful ex-boyfriend.\nHaving written about Gamergate in its early days, reading Quinn\u2019s debut book \u2014 also called Crash Override, and released today \u2014 brought back a familiar dread. (As I type this, I\u2019m imagining the random strangers who will surely pop up to quibble over the paragraph above.) Gamergate was a precursor to modern online ideological battles, and some of its best-known figures moved from gaming to general far-right politics. But there\u2019s still a kind of closure in seeing its original events laid out and wrapped up this way, in a book that\u2019s by turns a memoir, sociological study, and self-help text. And for Quinn, it\u2019s a way to move on.\n\u201cI sort of wanted to brain-dump everything that I\u2019ve learned and put that into everybody else\u2019s hands,\u201d Quinn told me in a phone interview late last month. \u201cI just needed that to be out there, so I could have fewer conversations where I had to explain all this to people.\u201d In the wake of the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, and the online white-supremacist crackdown that followed, I talked to her about where the internet can go from here \u2014 and how we can live with each other as it gets there.\nInterview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nReading Crash Override was sometimes difficult for me, because a lot of it seemed to suggest that there really weren\u2019t great structural solutions to the problems that you\u2019re talking about, and people just need to learn digital self-defense. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s an overly dark interpretation.\nI guess it\u2019s less that there aren\u2019t any \u2014 it\u2019s just that we have them, and they\u2019re not working, and I don\u2019t foresee them starting to work any time soon, because there\u2019s really no incentive for it. Like, every digital platform you sign up for, you agree to end user license agreements that usually say \u201cHey, don\u2019t do stuff like threaten people on our service!\u201d They\u2019re just not being enforced.\nIf you look at the other structural institutions, law enforcement, that\u2019s not really a preventative measure at all. Our justice system is a punitive one that\u2019s there to sort of deal with what happens after someone\u2019s already offended. A lot of what has to be done isn\u2019t just self-defense, as much as making people aware of the fact that not much is being done.\nYou talk a bit about using restorative instead of punitive justice. I\u2019m curious what you see that looking like with someone like an internet harasser.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this view that if anything happens online, it\u2019s not really your problem.\u201d\nRestorative justice is a little bit above my pay grade \u2014 I don\u2019t want to try to speak for that entire movement. But a lot of it has to do with centering the needs of the person who was hurt, viewing it as a process and more of a community-building effort. Right now, there\u2019s this view that if anything happens online, it\u2019s not really your problem. It would be nice to see it shift to more along the lines of, \u201cThis is something that belongs to all of us. How do we make this better?\u201d\nSince Gamergate, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on the threat of left or liberal online mobs and \u201cInternet Inquisitors,\u201d to use a term from your book. Is there a reasonable comparison there?\nThere are issues within groups that are trying to make things better, where there are sometimes new activists who don\u2019t really know a better way to bring people into the fold. However, I think that it\u2019s very difficult to try to even have a conversation when we\u2019re lumping something like minoritized groups calling out a member of their group internally with anything having to do with fucking Nazis.\nIt\u2019s very easy to be at wits\u2019 end when you\u2019re operating within a larger system of power and oppression, and then to add the pressure of trying to relate to another person dealing with those same issues\u2026 I think that comes from a very, very, very different place than some fucking torch-wielding white supremacist trying to find the next marginalized person to target.\nOn a separate note, your account of growing up with SomethingAwful was interesting, and I had slightly similar experiences with 4chan. It feels like places where young people often acted terribly, but could also figure out their sexuality or other aspects of themselves, are now just culture war recruiting grounds. Can you have transgressive spaces anymore where that doesn\u2019t happen?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like any of these feelings or thoughts are new; we just know about them now.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to say, because those spaces existed before everyone was online. The stakes are a lot different now than they were then, and even something like these little pockets of weirdness on 4chan \u2014 like, fucking Stormfront saw that as a recruiting ground. These people look for those impressionable younger kids that are trying out a bunch of different identities and trying to figure themselves out.\nI think if we\u2019re able to figure out a way to kind of have private spaces again, sure. I think that that can be created. But the problem is fundamentally if it\u2019s some teenage idiot going on Twitter and doing these things, it\u2019s not like the fact that they are figuring their own shit out has any impact on what that means to other people. There\u2019s no functional difference between an Elliot Rodger telling me he\u2019s going to come fucking kill me, and some idiot teenager saying he\u2019s going to fucking come kill me to impress his other idiot teenager friends.\nHow do we live with the knowledge that people around us might secretly be posting terrible things \u2014 which they really do believe \u2014 online?\nI feel like all of this has just highlighted the fact that we don\u2019t teach people how to build community. It\u2019s not like any of these feelings or thoughts are new; we just know about them now. We don\u2019t know how to cope with the information age. We don\u2019t know how to cope with the fact that so much bad shit happens, because we\u2019ve never had to think about it or hear about it before.\nThe biggest thing is, we\u2019ll take care of each other. Yes, we are all freaked out, we are all scared, we are all lonely fucked-up weird people, and that\u2019s okay. Because we\u2019re also all we have out here. Nazis are hitting people with cars in the goddamn streets now, and we can\u2019t really afford to not actively build community, take care of each other, and see who in your life might be leaning into this weird, dark place.\nDo you think that if people had responded differently to Gamergate, we could have prevented the sort of weaponized trolling that the alt-right has used over the past year?\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really afford to not actively build community.\u201d\nI think it probably would have helped to stifle some of the infrastructure that they built off it. The thing to remember is, I was not the first person that this happened to. This has been happening to black women online for a long time, this has been happening to trans women online for a long time, this has been happening to women in the infosec community for a long time. It\u2019s not like Gamergate invented all of the nasty, disgusting shit that existed online. It\u2019s just, my ex was smart enough to sort of give them a banner to rally around, and my industry unfortunately treated them with legitimacy for a while.\nOne of the bright spots in the book is your collaboration with Chuck Tingle, whose work I think of as weirdly utopian.\nI\u2019m a longtime fan of his, because I thought it was brilliant that someone was bringing absurdity to erotica, which are not usually two things that go together \u2014 on purpose, anyway.\n\u201cI thought it was brilliant that someone was bringing absurdity to erotica.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a certain amount of rubbernecking that\u2019s very easy to do with me, because I think that consumption of misery feels like doing something to a lot of people. Being able to willfully depart from that and say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to make something silly and fun, that\u2019s very warm-hearted and very sweet,\u201d has been really nice. It\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say pure, because we\u2019ve got the girl who plays the little girl in Mrs. Doubtfire and Matilda reading artisanal erotic smut about a unicorn butt cop and a bigfoot pirate ghost having sex in a police station \u2014 but\u2026 wholesome, in a weird way?\nI think I know what you mean. He can write sex that\u2019s not based on the kind of real-world power games that often end up being written into erotica.\nSex is human and funny and goofy, and we\u2019re taking it back from any sort of place where someone feels kind of shiitty. There\u2019s no shame in people who are into that dynamic, who want to go for that, if that\u2019s your thing. But it\u2019s also fun to be silly about it sometimes.\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine exactly how awful everything can get right now, and it feels like we don\u2019t necessarily have a way to think about utopias, or how it could get better.\nI guess that\u2019s the thing that breaks my heart, that I\u2019ve seen things get better, and it\u2019s that small community-outreach thing. The resiliency and healing I\u2019ve found in smaller communities has been tremendous for me and is absolutely the reason I\u2019m still here.\nThe reason I namecheck restorative justice so much is because that, to me, is the utopia. Because this punitive shit I feel like long-term is just going to build different structures of oppression and harm. My biggest thing right now is trying to figure out, how do I help push for a place that\u2019s got more mercy in it? Where people have less pressure on them all of the time to try to be perfect?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fucking marathon. It\u2019s not a race.\u201d\nThat includes the people that others turn to for advice \u2014 like, \u201cThis person is an outspoken black feminist on Twitter, I\u2019m going to ask for free education all of the time because I think they\u2019re just available for that.\u201d How do we help draw these boundaries where people are opting into that sort of work, and being even compensated?\nCrash Override includes some really frustrating anecdotes about platforms letting online abuse slide. What do you think about the companies that have started banning white supremacists after Charlottesville?\nWe\u2019ll fucking see, you know? There was a spike in people actually giving a shit when what was happening to me made gigantic news, and then that slowly tapered off when it wasn\u2019t a bad look anymore. But I try not to be bitter, and I genuinely hope that they actually do take some kind of steps.\nAs much frustration as I have with the current structures in place, the entire book\u2019s point was that if everybody gives a shit \u2014 if we kind of step up and say \u201cThis is not acceptable\u201d \u2014 then they\u2019re going to have fall in line. The fact that people are actually doing that gives me hope, it just has to be sustained. And it\u2019s a fucking marathon. It\u2019s not a race.\n"}
