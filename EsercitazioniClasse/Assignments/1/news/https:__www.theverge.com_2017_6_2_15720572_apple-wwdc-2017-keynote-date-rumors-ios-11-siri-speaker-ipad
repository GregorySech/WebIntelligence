{"title": "Apple\u2019s WWDC 2017: a Siri speaker, iOS 11, and what else to expect", "content": " \nIt\u2019s June again, so it\u2019s time for Apple to give the world a look at what it\u2019s been up to and what we should expect from the iPhone, the Mac, and everything in between in the months to come.\nOn Monday, Apple will kick off this year\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference with a keynote presentation where, like every year, the company\u2019s top executives will take the stage to talk about their next big releases. Traditionally, WWDC has been a software show, with a heavy focus on iOS and macOS (and, recently, tvOS and watchOS as well). But this year, there have been rumblings that we should expect some hardware news too \u2014 including at least one brand new product \u2014 which could make the event even more interesting than usual.\nThe keynote starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on June 5th. The Verge will be reporting live from San Jose, so be sure to come back then for all the news.\nFor now, here\u2019s our guide on what to expect on Monday. There haven\u2019t been a ton of leaks this year, so while we have some ideas of what Apple\u2019s planning, there should still be plenty of surprises in store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\nSoftware\nHere\u2019s something we can expect in pretty good confidence: Apple will announce the next iterations of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. All four of Apple\u2019s big platforms are on yearly release cycles, with announcements in June, developer previews shortly thereafter, and public releases in the fall. This year shouldn\u2019t be any different.\nBut what should we expect from each of them? That\u2019s where it gets a bit trickier.\niOS design updates: Bloomberg reported last month that iOS 11 would have \u201can updated user interface,\u201d though it didn\u2019t offer any details beyond that. One possibility: Apple appears to be working on a \u201cdark mode\u201d for the entire operating system, which changes most backgrounds from white to black. That wouldn\u2019t just be for visual flair. If Apple introduces an OLED iPhone, as it\u2019s rumored to this fall, a dark mode would save battery by letting the screen keep more pixels turned off \u2014 much like what the Apple Watch does.\nMore stylus support: Bloomberg also said we may see updates for the iPad based around the Pencil. Apple might update its apps, like Mail and Safari, to allow the stylus to be used for annotations. It could even go further, mimicking the kind of mark up anything-and-everything abilities that Samsung has given its S Pen styluses.\nThe iPad\u2019s multitasking features need to get more pro\nPro iPad features: There\u2019s a lot Apple can do to improve the iPad\u2019s multitasking to really offer a pro experience on the iPad Pro; a native version of this this drag-and-drop feature would be a good start. I\u2019m also strongly hoping this is the year we finally see support for multiple user accounts \u2014 it\u2019s a frustrating omission, but Apple began laying the groundwork for the feature last year.\nLots of app updates: Apple\u2019s other big story is likely to be app upgrades \u2014 looking back to last year, some of iOS\u2019s biggest changes came through apps like iMessage and Photos. It\u2019d be surprising not to see Apple continue that push this year, especially with how successful its changes to iMessage have been.\nA way to pay your friends: A recent Recode report says Apple has been weighing a peer-to-peer payments service that would compete with the likes of Venmo and Square Cash, but it\u2019s unclear whether that would be a feature of Apple Pay or whether it would exist as a cash-exchange feature in iMessage (or both).\nSomething to watch in Apple Music: Apple is typically dead quiet when it comes to what it\u2019s working on. Jimmy Iovine, however, is another story. And it seems like Iovine may have let it slip to Bloomberg that Apple Music will be reworked this year to better feature video. That\u2019s good timing, since Apple\u2019s first original shows are coming out soon. Carpool Karaoke arrives August 8th, and we may hear about Planet of the Apps on Monday.\nSiri gets smarter: Apple\u2019s digital assistant has been getting one-upped and lapped and probably three other equivalent sports metaphors in the past couple years. If Apple wants to take on the Amazon Echoes and Google Homes of the world \u2014 and it sure sounds like it does \u2014 Siri is going to need to do a better jobs of connecting to third party apps and surfacing information for you. It seems likely Apple will start to make more of that happen this year.\nSmall and steady updates to the Mac\nSmall changes to macOS: Apple hasn\u2019t made big changes to macOS in years (aside from its name), but it\u2019ll certainly keep polishing away and adding new features here and there, with many likely inside Apple-made apps like Mail. Siri was introduced last year, and it could get more powerful this year \u2014 last year, it was missing third-party support.\nImprovements to watchOS and tvOS: Apple\u2019s two youngest operating systems have been getting very useful and occasionally dramatic changes year to year. There\u2019s no word on what to expect this time around, but it\u2019d be a surprise if we didn\u2019t see Apple keep iterating on the basic experience of using both operating systems. WatchOS still needs work on how it displays apps, and Apple is still figuring out how rework the classic TV guide with tvOS.\nIn an interview with The Verge in February, Apple TV executive Eddy Cue suggested that the future of web TV would be much more \u201cinteractive,\u201d so it\u2019s possible that any software changes could allow app developers to create more interactive apps. And according to a recent report from BuzzFeed News, Amazon Prime Video will finally run on Apple TV, something that Apple TV users have been wanting for years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\n\nHardware\nApple talks hardware every now and then during WWDC, and it seems like 2017 is going to be one of those years. Potentially, a big one.\nSiri speaker: Apple\u2019s answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home may well be announced on Monday. What\u2019ll it do? What\u2019ll it look like? Pretty much all of that is speculation for now \u2014 there\u2019s even disagreement over whether or not it\u2019ll have a screen.\nThe speaker is one reason to expect updates to Siri this year, as you can bet that Apple will want to let app developers take advantage of this new device. (It\u2019s unveiling the product at a developer conference, after all.) You can imagine Apple adopting a similar model to how it distributes apps for watchOS, where developers can build Siri features into their core mobile app.\nApple will want to step up Siri\u2019s game to take on Alexa\nThere are a few basic details we do know so far. Bloomberg said recently that Apple has started manufacturing the speaker and that it\u2019ll feature \u201cvirtual surround sound\u201d to provide better audio quality. It\u2019ll also function as a hub for HomeKit, Apple\u2019s smart home system. That\u2019s likely to be a highlight for the product.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Apple has any big features up its sleeve that make its smart speaker stand out from the competition. But tight integration with Apple\u2019s ecosystem of products may be enough. If you already have an iPhone, Apple\u2019s upcoming product may be the easiest smart speaker to get started with.\nA new iPad size: This one seems a little bit less certain, but the reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple\u2019s been working on a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and will likely introduce it at WWDC. The new model is supposed to be about the same size as the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it\u2019ll be able to fit a larger screen by narrowing down the device\u2019s bezels. WWDC would be unusual timing for an iPad Pro launch, but Apple released a surprise update of the standard iPad in March, so perhaps it\u2019s just putting them out as they come.\nUpdated MacBooks and MacBook Pros: Nothing major here, but it\u2019s time for Apple\u2019s laptops to get some spec bumps. Intel has a new line of processors out \u2014 Kaby Lake \u2014 and Apple should update its laptops to support them, offering a little bit more power and little bit more battery life. There\u2019s also rumors that the MacBook Pro could get an option for more RAM, though that might still be down the road.\nNot quite the Air update we were looking for\nA depressing update for the MacBook Air: It\u2019s been two years since Apple updated the MacBook Air, and it certainly looks like the company would happily watch its former star wither away and die. But apparently, sales have remained strong \u2014 it\u2019s Apple\u2019s only laptop under $1,000 \u2014 and Bloomberg reports that it\u2019s likely to receive an update to include Kaby Lake processors, too.\nThat won\u2019t do much to modernize the laptop \u2014 the Air\u2019s screen, in particular, is now low-resolution and outdated \u2014 but it\u2019ll justify the laptop staying around and provide a bit more value for anyone who\u2019s still interested. There\u2019s been some suggestion the Air could get updated to USB-C too, but that\u2019d require more work on Apple\u2019s part, so it wouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise to see everything but the processor stay the same.\nWhat we (probably) won\u2019t see: iPhones are off the table. iMacs could use new processors, but there\u2019s no word on that yet. And while Apple has promised a new Mac Pro, that likely isn\u2019t arriving until at least next year. It\u2019s always possible Apple will talk about its plans for a new pro machine, but a release is a long ways out. The Apple Watch will likely be updated this fall; and while a 4K Apple TV is said to be in the works, there\u2019s no sign it\u2019s coming this month.\n"}
