{"title": "The Moon has more water than we thought", "content": " \nThe Moon has more water than previously thought, and it\u2019s deep below the lunar surface. A new study suggests that water is widespread beyond the poles, where it was already known to exist, although scientists don\u2019t know exactly how much water is there. The discovery has consequences for future missions to the Moon.\nScientists analyzed lunar rock samples that contain tiny, water-trapping beads of glass; these beads formed when magma erupted from the Moon\u2019s interior billions of years ago, trapping water inside them. The scientists then looked at satellite data collected by an Indian lunar orbiter to check where these water-trapping glass beads are. The results, published today in Nature Geoscience, show that there are widespread \u201chot spots\u201d of water-rich volcanic material beyond the Moon\u2019s poles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows where the water-rich deposits are on the surface of the Moon.\nImage: Nature Geoscience\n\n\nFor years, scientists thought the Moon was completely dry. Then in 2008, scientists found water trapped in those glass beads of volcanic rocks collected during the Apollo missions in the 1970s. And more evidence has been found since then. But there are still questions about just how wet the Moon\u2019s interior is. Today\u2019s study tries to answer this question, using satellite data collected by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.\n\u201cThe fact that they see this feature associated with the glasses tells us that there was indeed quite a bit of water in the interior of the Moon when these volcanic eruptions were occurring,\u201d Anthony Colaprete of NASA told National Geographic.\nThe study doesn\u2019t say just how much water there is, but it maps where these water-rich hot spots are \u2014 near the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, for instance. This information is useful because if people return to the Moon, they could mine the surface for water instead of carrying it all the way from Earth. Now we know where more of this precious resource is.\n"}
