{"title": "The director of this Wonder Woman mash-up wanted to \u2018match her epicness\u2019", "content": " \nWith the Wonder Woman movie on the immediate horizon, and early word of mouth looking promising, it\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019re seeing an onslaught of Wonder Woman-related videos hitting the internet, from essays on her importance to costume breakdowns to cheeky ads linking the character with other parts of the greater DC Comics continuum. Now Nerdist is in on the act, with a parody musical mash-up turning three actors into a variety of iterations on Wonder Woman throughout the decades.\nThe video was directed by Nerdist supervising creative producer Andrew Bowser, who also helmed the Beauty And The Beast / Migos music parody \u201cBelle And Boujee,\u201d and the Spider-Man / Bruno Mars video \u201cThat Spidey Life.\u201d The latest video puts Wonder Woman-related lyrics into six \u201cclassic feminist anthems,\u201d from Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThese Boots Are Made For Walkin\u2019\u201d to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRun The World (Girls).\u201d It starts in an intimate setting, with Nerdist News host Jessica Chobot dressed as Lynda Carter in the 1970s TV series Wonder Woman, singing directly into the camera. But as it moves through the eras to the present, it expands until actor Ciara Renee \u2014 a Broadway performer who\u2019s played Hawkgirl on The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow \u2014 is leading a squad of Wonder Women in formation, evoking Beyonc\u00e9 in \u201cRun The World (Girls).\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Bowser said Chobot originally suggested the idea for a Wonder Woman music video because she\u2019s such a fan of the character. Nerdist\u2019s producers workshopped the idea, and Bowser suggested the medley approach. \u201cI struck upon the idea of doing a parody of not just one song, but many songs, since the character\u2019s so timeless,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously been through so many iterations. It seemed to match her epicness.\u201d\nWhile the video moves through a variety of visual styles and looks, mimicking its six source videos, Bowser says his crew used the same camera throughout, and that cinematographer Meena Singh achieved most of the looks \u2014 the overblown lushness of Madonna\u2019s \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d video, the gauzy spangle of Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d \u2014 with in-camera effects. The post-production mostly involved digitally adding film grain, and giving \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d a VHS look. Bowser says the team didn\u2019t want the \u201cmanufactured\u201d look of too much post-production, so they tried to re-create the original videos as organically as possible. \nIn some cases, that involved old-school camera tricks, like smearing \u201cface grease\u201d from one of the camera operators on the lens to get the softer look for the Houston video parody. In others, it involved carefully picking which parts of the source videos to copy. \u201cParodying all six videos, with many setups from each video, would have been cost-prohibitive,\u201d Bowser says. \u201cI specifically looked for moments that were easier to emulate. There\u2019s stuff in \u2018Material Girl\u2019 \u2014 obviously we could never pull out and do the whole Busby Berkley dance number, but you can get some of those [smaller] moments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNerdist\n\n\nCostuming was a challenge on a small budget. Bowser says Wardrobe stylist Rae Esterlina drew on some specific historical Wonder Woman looks, like her New 52 costume, but was largely working toward blending recognizable Wonder Woman costuming with the pop stars from the original videos, which explains the lacy-crop-top-sweater Britney Spears version of the character in the \u201cStronger\u201d segment. Part of the consideration there, Bowser says, was that the video\u2019s third Wonder Woman, Katrina Rosita, needed to be wearing something flexible enough to survive an energetic dance.\nNerdist ended up getting help from cosplayers as well. \u201cThey\u2019re very nice to us at Nerdist,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWe have a really good relationship with the cosplay community, and I\u2019m always really thankful, because cosplayers spend a lot of time on their costumes, and they don\u2019t always want to rent them out. And I understand that, because they\u2019ve sometimes put thousands of dollars into their costumes, and if we put one of those on and dance all day, it could potentially be ruined. So we have to find cosplayers who can either appear in their costumes as themselves, or are willing to rent their costumes, if we\u2019ve cast the parts already.\u201d \nCopying the original songs was also a challenge. Bowser says music producer Freddy Scott had to reproduce the source songs from scratch: \u201cBecause it\u2019s parody, you\u2019ve got to create these soundalikes. He created all the music. He basically remade those songs on his own, so there\u2019s no copyright infringement. We\u2019re not using the actual music. It\u2019s slightly different, changed just enough to be within fair use.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a lot of work for less than five minutes of humor video, but the on-screen results are seamless.
