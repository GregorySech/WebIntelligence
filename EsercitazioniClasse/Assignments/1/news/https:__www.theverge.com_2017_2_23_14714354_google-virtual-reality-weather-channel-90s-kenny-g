{"title": "Google filmmaker makes VR video mash-up of \u201890s Weather Channel footage and Kenny G", "content": " \nIs there a more comforting experience than sitting in your childhood living room, hypnotized by the green confetti of The Weather Channel\u2019s doppler radar? Probably not, at least according to Jessica Brillhart, a virtual reality filmmaker at Google who tried to mimic that experience in a new video. \nA stormy Kenny G experience\nSpotted by Bloomberg reporter Mark Bergen, \u201cConditions at Omaha\u201d is a three-minute VR clip that pulls together four different local weather forecasts that aired in Omaha, Nebraska in the 1990s. The soundtrack is, of course, Kenny G, a man who managed to tame the saxophone enough to make it palatable for flash flood warnings. Hard to imagine checking the weather while listening to a Kenny G song called \u201cOne Night Stand,\u201d but it has probably happened to you. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been biting at the bit to create a place of calm and serenity similar to that of watching The Weather Channel in the 90's while sitting a foot away from the television screen,\u201d Brillhart wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure why, but I decided fairly quickly that this project would be an homage to Omaha weather. An \u2018Omahomage\u2019 as it were.\u201d\nThe resulting video is cozy, weird, and just short enough so you can ignore the fact there\u2019s absolutely no reason you\u2019d need to know what the weather was like in Omaha two decades ago. \nThe video is available in 360-degrees on YouTube, and is compatible with Google Cardboard and Daydream View. Hot tip: make sure you look up and down while watching. \n"}
