{"title": "The 'three-parent baby' fertility doctor needs to stop marketing the procedure, FDA says", "content": " \nThe doctor who created a genetically modified \u201cthree-parent baby\u201d has been reprimanded by the Food and Drug Administration for aggressively marketing the unapproved experimental procedure.\nJohn Zhang, CEO of the New Hope Fertility Center in New York, famously combined the DNA of three people to help a mother who was a carrier for a genetic disease conceive an apparently healthy baby boy last year. Now, Zhang and his company are marketing the pricy procedure as the \u201cfirst proven treatment for certain genetic disorders and a successful solution to age-related infertility.\u201d \nHowever, the FDA does not allow clinical research in people that would involve genetically modifying an embryo. And because Zhang\u2019s technique and the one child it produced are both still in their infancy, we don\u2019t know how well the treatment really works, or if it comes with any unforeseen consequences. On Friday, the FDA posted a letter to Zhang online, informing him that marketing the procedure is illegal, since the FDA hasn\u2019t given him permission to test it in people. The agency asked him to correct his violations, and respond in writing.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a Catch 22.\u201d\nZhang sought permission to conduct clinical research in April 2016, the FDA\u2019s letter says. But the FDA is legally barred from even considering requests to modify the genes of an embryo that could then be inherited. \u201cIt\u2019s a Catch 22,\u201d says Leigh Turner, a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota who first brought the FDA\u2019s letter to public attention. \nZhang promised that until the FDA gave him permission, his company Darwin Life wouldn\u2019t generate any more modified embryos in the US, the letter says. However, he, Darwin Life, and New Hope Fertility Center continue to market the procedure \u2014 calling it HER IVF, or Human Egg Rejuvenation In Vitro Fertilization. The Darwin Life website says that HER IVF is \u201cdesigned to reverse the effects of age on human oocytes and repair certain cellular defects.\u201d The procedure will cost about $100,000, MIT Technology Review\u2019s Emily Mullin reported in June 2017. \nBut without clinical trials, it\u2019s impossible to say what the risks and the benefits of the procedure truly are for people trying to avoid passing a genetic disease to their children. Or whether the technique is even capable of  \u201crejuvenating\u201d an older woman\u2019s egg \u201cby replacing its \u2018batteries,\u2019\u201d as Zhang\u2019s blog claims.  \n\u201cYou have individuals who are desperate to have a child, who are concerned about mitochondrial disease, and so are vulnerable to these aggressive marketing tactics,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThis is an area where I think there\u2019s something to be said about being cautious, being careful, being prudent, and not just jumping out there into the market place.\u201d Zhang, New Hope, and Darwin Life were unavailable for comment. (Zhang responded via email he might be available to comment later in the week, and the story will be updated at that time.)\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said about being cautious, being careful, being prudent.\u201d\nZhang isn\u2019t the first to combine the DNA of three individuals in a single embryo, but long term studies of the so-called three-parent babies of the 1990s are limited. He is the first to use a technique called nuclear transfer, which takes advantage of the fact that there are two different kinds of DNA in human cells. The bulk of the mother\u2019s genome is tangled in the egg\u2019s nucleus, but separate strands of DNA floating in the egg cell build the body\u2019s energy generators, the mitochondria. \nMutations in mitochondrial DNA are passed down by the mother, and can cause life-threatening and incurable diseases in her child. By combining the nuclear DNA of the mother with the unmutated mitochondrial DNA from an egg donor, it might be possible to prevent a child from inheriting the disease.\nZhang and his colleagues modified a human embryo to try and bypass a mutation in the mother\u2019s mitochondria. In New York, the team injected the mother\u2019s nuclear genome into the hollowed egg from a donor. After fertilizing the egg, they then shipped the embryo to Mexico to implant in the mother\u2019s uterus. In its letter, the FDA informed Zhang that such embryo exports are not permitted.\nWithout tracking the child\u2019s health through adulthood, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the procedure is safe or effective\nIn April 2017, Zhang reported that the baby was still healthy seven months after it was born. But in an editorial published alongside the study, experts noted that without tracking the child\u2019s health through adulthood, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the procedure is safe or effective in the long term. Follow up studies will be tricky, because the child\u2019s parents have said that they don\u2019t want their child\u2019s genes tested for the mutation unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. \nThe UK has approved a similar mitochondrial replacement technique, but only in attempts to prevent the child from inheriting a genetic disease. Last year experts recommended that mitochondrial replacement therapies also be allowed in the US to prevent genetic diseases, under very specific conditions. However, it currently remains banned. \n\u201cThis is a biologically extreme and risky procedure,\u201d Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society, told MIT Technology Review. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about using these techniques for age-related infertility, that\u2019s really moving the human experimentation to a very large scale.\u201d\n"}
