{"title": "Samsung\u2019s new Notebook 9 Pro includes a built-in S Pen", "content": " \nSamsung is bringing its S Pen technology to the company\u2019s notebook line today. At Computex, Samsung is launching its new Notebook 9 Pro. Unlike the previous Notebook 9 series, this Pro version now has a 360-degree hinge just like Lenovo\u2019s Yoga laptops and it means the Notebook 9 Pro can be used as a tablet or a laptop. Samsung is pairing that hinge with an embedded S Pen that slides into the base of the Notebook 9 Pro.\nThe S Pen includes 4,000 levels of pressure and the ability to detect tilt for shading (just like Microsoft's new Surface Pen). It also includes Samsung\u2019s Air Command software for drawing, notes, and editing documents. Samsung is also ensuring its S Pen is fully compatible with Windows Ink, allowing Notebook 9 Pro users to use the stylus across all of Windows 10. \nSamsung's Notebook 9 Pro includes a Yoga-like hinge\nSamsung is releasing 13.3- and 15-inch models of the Notebook 9 Pro, and both will include Intel\u2019s latest Core i7 processors. The 13.3-inch version will ship with 8GB of RAM, while the larger model includes 16GB of RAM. Both will include a 256GB SSD, and the 15-inch model has AMD\u2019s Radeon 450 graphics card inside. \nSamsung is using USB-C support for fast charging, alongside two regular USB ports, a HDMI port, and support for microSD storage. There\u2019s even a Windows Hello camera at the front, with support for facial recognition to log into Windows 10. Samsung isn\u2019t providing a release date or pricing today for the Notebook 9 Pro, but given its introduction at Computex it\u2019s reasonable to assume this will be available later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: samsung\n\n\n"}
