{"title": "Watch the first gameplay trailer for Destiny 2", "content": " \nBungie today revealed the very first gameplay footage of its upcoming Destiny sequel, showing fans at an event in Los Angeles and those watching on its Twitch stream an early glimpse of the revamped online-only shooter. The game, due out on September 8th, 2017, is slightly altering its setting from the initial multi-planetary adventure in the first game. Now, players are fighting to retake Earth\u2019s Last City from a hostile alien force and defend the game\u2019s iconic Traveler, a sentient life form that protects Earth in the far future. \nTo the disappointment of many Hawkmoon and Gjallarhorn lovers everywhere, all the old gear is being left behind, canonically destroyed by the invasion of the military Cabal species.  In the first CGI trailer released alongside the game\u2019s unveiling back at the end of March, we got the narrative rundown on the upcoming war between humanity\u2019s Guardians and the Red Legion, with its villainous leader Ghaul. (Bungie is calling this the \u201cRed War Campaign.\u201d) In the first gameplay reveal, we get a look at some of the new guns and supernatural abilities \u2014 including a flaming Warlock sword \u2014 as well as what appears to be an even more cinematic mission layout and structure. \n\n\nIn Destiny 2's Story Campaign, you'll embark on a massive journey to fight back against the Red Legion and reclaim our home. pic.twitter.com/rYa7Q2ApLQ\u2014 Destiny The Game (@DestinyTheGame) May 18, 2017\n\n\n\nSince its September 2014 launch, Destiny has been equal parts ambitious and controversial in the game industry. It\u2019s irregular release model meant that, at launch, the game felt unfinished and in serious need of polish based on extensive player feedback. And yet, as Bungie refined Destiny over a number of different expansions, both large and small, the game evolved into a satisfying and rich experience that fully realized the blend of FPS and MMO elements it originally set out to achieve. \nDestiny is unlike a traditional shooter, which typically comes finished out of the box with additional add-ons down the line to help the game make money over time. And it\u2019s not quite an MMO, the creators of which tend to charge monthly subscription fees to keep the game alive over the course of many years. \n\n\nDestiny 2 will feature brand new Exotic Weapons and Armor. pic.twitter.com/zQsu5sKpO5\u2014 Destiny The Game (@DestinyTheGame) May 18, 2017\n\n\n\nInstead, Bungie employed a kind of hybrid model fitting for its hybrid title, which the company likes to call a \u201cshared world shooter.\u201d That means Bungie and publisher Activision sold a base piece of software for $60 and then, over the course of more than two and a half years, additional expansions ranging from $20 to $40. So players that stuck with Destiny since launch eventually paid more than $150 for the experience, and yet many extracted hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of gameplay out of it. The value of this experience has depended largely on how invested you as a player became, and the friends that stuck it out for the whole ride. \nWith Destiny 2, which in a first for the series is coming to PC, it\u2019s unclear how exactly Bungie is going to pace the game\u2019s release structure and what exactly it will feel like at launch. Given all it learned over the last nearly three years of ongoing Destiny development, we can expect the company to have learned a thing or two. We\u2019ll know more as Bungie continues its slow drip of announcements and reveals leading up to the September launch. \n\n"}
