{"title": "Chevrolet is the first big carmaker to offer an unlimited data plan", "content": " \nIt\u2019s not just big carriers offering unlimited data plans these days \u2014 carmaker Chevrolet has now got in on the act, announcing today that it would offer an unlimited 4G LTE plan for drivers to use inside their cars. The plan is available from March 3rd, and will cost $20 a month. For that price, subscribers will be able to have access to a prepaid OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, enabled by AT&T, that offers unlimited data on the move. \nChevrolet says that in-car Wi-Fi use jumped last year, with customers using 4 million gigabytes of data \u2014 that\u2019s 200 percent more data than was used through its OnStar hotspots than in 2015. In the second half of 2016 alone, the company says that Chevrolet owners used almost as much data as they had in the previous 24 months combined. \nThe new plan comes as US carriers are suddenly rolling out their own unlimited subscription options, after years of railing against the concept. For those carriers, the change was born of competition, and the auto industry isn\u2019t likely to be much different. Expect Chevrolet\u2019s competitors to roll out their own unlimited options as people are using more and more data in their cars, for music, movies, and maps, and as in-car infotainment systems become the norm. \n"}
