{"title": "Here's the one thing scientists want you to know", "content": " \nVaginas are like self-cleaning ovens; an octopus\u2019s wriggly appendages are called arms not tentacles; and there\u2019s no biological basis for race. These are just a few of the facts that scientists on Twitter want you to know, so they\u2019re sharing them with the hashtag #MyOneScienceTweet. \nThe hashtag started with Dalton Ludwick, the same entomology graduate student who brought the #BillMeetScienceTwitter hashtag to life. This time, Ludwick asked: \u201cIf you could have the entire world know just one thing about your field of study, then what would it be?\u201d\nScientists, science communicators, and clinicians started sharing facts that ranged from cool trivia about sea creatures to key reminders about the importance of diversity in science. If you\u2019re in for learning some fun science facts, we\u2019ve rounded up a few of the highlights. \nSome of the tweets, for instance, cleared up misconceptions about the natural world. \n\n\nPolar bears don\u2019t live in AntarcticaPolar bears don\u2019t live in AntarcticaPolar bears don\u2019t live in Antarctica#MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/nbMfKyGbYS\u2014 Michelle LaRue (@drmichellelarue) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nOctopus don't have any tentacles. 0. Not one. They have 8 arms.   Squid and cuttlefish have 8 arms AND 2 tentacles.  #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/fg7NB1ryrU\u2014 Thomas Clements (@Thomas_Clements) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nOthers tried to dispel myths about what the adorable and endangered Australian marsupial called the Tasmanian devil really looks like.\n\n\nTHIS IS NOT WHAT A TASMANIAN DEVIL LOOKS LIKE!!! #MyOneScienceTweet pic.twitter.com/B4AKKanerE\u2014 David Hamilton (@davidghamilton1) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS is what a Tasmanian devil looks like #MyOneScienceTweet pic.twitter.com/scyerx3jLd\u2014 David Hamilton (@davidghamilton1) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nSome tweets were efforts to educate about wildlife conservation. \n\n\nSharks are not a threat to humans, and humans are better off with healthy shark populations than we are without them #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/84avMfdBjo\u2014 Dr. David Shiffman (@WhySharksMatter) October 28, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen carnivores are absent from the landscape, ecosystems simplify and we lose ecosystem services that benefit humans. #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/i241GAz5Bk\u2014 Imogene Cancellare (@biologistimo) October 28, 2017\n\n\n\nAnd some focused on health. Obstetrician-gynecologist and blogger Jennifer Gunter reminded Twitter that there are things that really don\u2019t belong in vaginas. (That includes cucumbers, in case you were wondering.)\n\n\nVaginas are like self cleaning ovens so no soaps, cleansing, douches or anything GOOP is selling https://t.co/uhEv7JE5v0\u2014 Jennifer Gunter (@DrJenGunter) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nAnd whatever anti-vaxxers say, vaccines save lives.\n\n\nThere's no debate about vaccines. They save lives and do not cause autism whatsoever. #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/YH6PyMClvK\u2014 Putrid Kyle Taylor (@PaddyKTaylor) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nBiological anthropologist Tina Lasisi reminded Twitter that there\u2019s no scientific basis for racial categories. \n\n\nAnthropologists did not stop using biological \u201crace\u201d to be politically correct, they stopped because it is bad science #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/M9kLLxpbT8\u2014 Tina Lasisi (@TinaLasisi) October 29, 2017\n\n\n\nThere are also more intimate secrets about the creatures we share our world with. For example, the sea slug Melibe leonina\u2019s secretions apparently smell like watermelon.\n\n\nThere is a species of sea slug that smells like watermelon #MyOneScienceTweet https://t.co/2dCC4p1bOO\u2014  SpooKyle  (@phycofrenzy) October 29, 2017\n\n\n\nAnd, in case you didn\u2019t know, fungi sexes are wild. \n\n\nSome fungi have more than 20,000 sexes.  But we can't tell them apart by how they look.  Only the fungi know.  #MyOneScienceTweet\u2014 Vaillancourt Lab (@VaillancourtLab) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nThis hashtag is just the latest science outreach effort on social media, and it\u2019s a welcome reminder that there are still fascinating things to learn about the world. So, you tell us, what\u2019s your favorite science fact? \n\n\n"}
