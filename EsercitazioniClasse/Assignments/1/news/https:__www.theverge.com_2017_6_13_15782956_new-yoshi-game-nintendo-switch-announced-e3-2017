{"title": "The adorable new Yoshi game on Switch looks like it\u2019s made out of cardboard", "content": " \nYoshi is swapping wool for paper in his next adventure. At its E3 spotlight today, Nintendo unveiled the next Yoshi game, and it looks like a cross between Yoshi\u2019s Woolly World and Paper Mario. Which is to say, it\u2019s incredibly cute and cuddly. Outside of aesthetics, though, it appears to be more of what you\u2019d expect from a new Yoshi game. Namely lots of side-scrolling action, filled with egg tossing and platforming. The game \u2014 which is currently just called Yoshi \u2014 is slated to launch on Nintendo Switch some time next year.\n"}
