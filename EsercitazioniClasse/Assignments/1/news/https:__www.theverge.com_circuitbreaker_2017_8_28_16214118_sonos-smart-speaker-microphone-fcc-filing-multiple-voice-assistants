{"title": "The Sonos smart speaker with microphone hits the FCC", "content": " \nSonos has been rumored to be putting together a smart speaker for some time now, and we\u2019ve just gotten the biggest confirmation yet that the company is working on its own voice assistant-powered device: an FCC filing that references a \u201cProduct model S13\u201d that adds \u201cintegrated voice control functionality,\u201d via Dave Zatz over at Zatz Not Funny!.  \nAccording to the FCC filing, S13 will have far-field microphones similar to those offered on products like the Amazon Echo to make it easy for the device to pick up and isolate sound from anywhere in a room. But Sonos isn\u2019t just putting all its eggs in the Alexa basket \u2014 S13 will purportedly support \u201cmultiple voice platforms and music services,\u201d and while details on that are obviously slim, it\u2019s something that would immediately elevate it over its competitors by not locking you in to just one smart assistant ecosystem. \nImagine it: a single smart speaker that supports Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. That\u2019s what we might be looking at here.\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t quite enough, the FCC filing also includes an image of a new UI, which prominently features a microphone icon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\u00a0Zatz Not Funny!\n\n\nGiven that Sonos is facing the imminent release of Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 a device that specifically called out Sonos as a competitor when it was first announced \u2014 along with rumors that Amazon might also be looking to get into the multi-room audio game, it\u2019s clear that the company is doing its best to make sure that it\u2019s ready to meet its challengers. \n"}
