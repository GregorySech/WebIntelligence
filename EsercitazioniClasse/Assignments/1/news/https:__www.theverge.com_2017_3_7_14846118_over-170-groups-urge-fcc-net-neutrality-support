{"title": "ACLU and 170 other organizations urge FCC to preserve net neutrality", "content": " \nThe future of net neutrality is in jeopardy again, so advocates are getting back to the fight. In a letter sent today to FCC chairman Ajit Pai, as well as Senators John Thune and Bill Nelson, over 170 groups ask Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to continue to support and protect the net neutrality rules put into place in 2015.\n\u201c[We] urge you and your colleagues to oppose legislation and regulatory actions that would threaten net neutrality and roll back the important protections put in place by the FCC in 2015 and to continue to enforce the Open Internet Order as it stands,\u201d the groups write.\nThe Harry Potter Alliance also signed in support\nThe letter comes just a day before the Senate Commerce Committee\u2019s first oversight hearing of the FCC while Pai is in charge. Thune is chairman of the committee, and Nelson is ranking member, which is why they\u2019re included on the letter. Tomorrow will be the committee\u2019s first chance to grill Pai on the direction he\u2019s taking the commission \u2014 the future of the FCC\u2019s privacy rules is likely to come up.\nCoincidentally enough, the letter was also sent just hours before Pai was nominated by President Trump for another five-year term at the commission.\nSignatories of the letter include the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Library Association, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace USA, and the Writers Guild of America, West, among many others. (Also included: The Harry Potter Alliance, an activist group of Harry Potter fans.)\nPai has said he believes using Title II to enact net neutrality was \u201ca mistake,\u201d and Thune believes the issue should be resolved in Congress. It\u2019s far from clear how this is going to play out, but either way, opponents of Title II are now in control of net neutrality\u2019s future, and these groups know it\u2019s going to be a long fight to keep those protections intact.\n"}
