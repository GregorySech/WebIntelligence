{"title": "Ubisoft\u2019s E3 2017 press conference in 8 minutes", "content": " \nUbisoft brought out the big guns \u2014 quite literally and fantastically, at times \u2014 to start their E3 2017 press conference. The event started with legendary Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto, who brought hand cannon toys on stage to introduce Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Ubisoft also announced Transference, a VR project with actor Elijah Wood; competitive naval pirate game Skull & Bones; and racing game The Crew 2 (now with boats and planes). Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Ubisoft show without Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, and a tease about Beyond Good and Evil 2 \u2014 so yeah, those were there, too.\nThere was, alas no Aisha Tyler hosting this year.\n"}
