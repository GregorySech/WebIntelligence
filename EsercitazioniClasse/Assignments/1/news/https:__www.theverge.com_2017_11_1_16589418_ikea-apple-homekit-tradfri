{"title": "Ikea smart lights now support HomeKit and Alexa, with Google Home still to come", "content": " \nAfter making a false start back in August, Ikea's TR\u00c5DFRI lights will now integrate with devices compatible with Apple's HomeKit smart home standard. The free software update makes Ikea's low-cost smart lights manageable from within Apple's Home app, but TR\u00c5DFRI dimmer switches and other accessories are not yet supported. The news was first spotted in the Swedish media and confirmed on Ikea's Facebook page. \nOwners of the TR\u00c5DFRI gateway can find the device's 8-digit HomeKit code in the just released 1.2 version of the Ikea TR\u00c5DFRI app, or printed on the underside of gateways sold more recently. \nThe Ikea TR\u00c5DFRI skill for Alexa is also live in countries where Amazon is selling Echo devices. After enabling it, owners will be able to ask Alexa to dim their Ikea bulbs, or turn them on and off. Unfortunately, the promised Google Home compatibility isn't live yet, and Ikea's Facebook page doesn\u2019t offer an expected date.\nUpdate November 1st, 8:17 AM ET: Article ammended with Alexa skill availability. \n"}
