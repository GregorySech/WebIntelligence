{"title": "New study explains why Trump\u2019s \u2018Sad\u2019 tweets are so effective", "content": " \nDuring his campaign and presidency, Donald Trump has used Twitter to circumvent traditional media broadcasters and speak directly to the masses. He is particularly known for one specific tweet construction: he sets up a situation that he feels should inspire anger or outrage, then punctuates it with \u201cSad!\u201d New research from New York University suggests a reason why this style is so effective: a tweet containing moral and emotional language spreads farther among people with similar political persuasion.\nThe study offered up \u201cduty\u201d as an example of a purely moral word, \u201cfear\u201d as a purely emotional one, and \u201chate\u201d as word that combined the two categories. The research found that the use of purely moral or purely emotional language had a limited impact on the spread of a tweet, but the \u201cpresence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word.\u201d \nThe impact of this language cut both ways. Tweets with moral-emotional words spread further among those with a similar political outlook, and they spread less with those who held opposing views, according to the research published in the journal PNAS. The study looked at 563,312 tweets on the topics of gun control, same-sex marriage, and climate change, and rated their impact by the number of retweets each one received.\nRighteous indignation, anyone? \nAcross all three topics, tweets that contained moral-emotional words were far more likely to induce \u201cmoral contagion\u201d (a fancy way of saying they went viral) than tweets that lacked this sort of language. The type of emotion present also played a role. Tweets that used language associated with love or anger spread further than those associated with disgust and sadness. That would seem counterintuitive, given Trump\u2019s success on Twitter, but it\u2019s worth noting that his use of the word \u201csad\u201d was often tied to expressions of anger or outrage. \nThe study concludes that there is an empirical basis to the argument that Trump\u2019s tweets, which struck many longtime observers of politics as ill-considered and unhinged, helped to power his successful campaign. \u201cIt seems likely that politicians, community leaders, and organizers of social movements express moral emotions\u2014of either positive or negative valence\u2014in an effort to increase message exposure and to influence perceived norms within social networks,\u201d the study reads. \u201cOur work suggests that such efforts might pay off.\u201d  \nThe study notes that its scope has so far been limited to Twitter, and that research on the transmission of ideas across the much larger user base of Facebook is needed. Still, if the findings are validated by future testing, it would indicate that Trump may have tapped into a powerful social media dynamic \u2014 and the rest of us are in for an era of very temperamental political tweets.\n \n \n \n\n"}
