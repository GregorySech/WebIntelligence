The car spends three weeks in the paint shop, then it\u2019s an entire week just to assemble the chassis \u2014 though these can happen simultaneously as they involve different parts of the car. Wheel alignment alone takes one to two days, which is important in a car is capable of more than 260 mph. Body assembly? That\u2019s another week.\nEach vehicle is extensively tested. The 16-cylinder, 1,500-horsepower engine is tested outside the car for eight hours. After the engine is installed in the car, the whole thing is tested to 124 mph on a rolling road inside the factory \u2014 a new piece of equipment installed especially for the Chiron because the old one, designed for the 1,200-horsepower Veyron, couldn\u2019t handle the increase in power and torque.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore they leave the factory, each car is outfitted with used wheels (so there\u2019s no chance of damage before delivery) and go on a 200-mile test drive, first on French mountain roads to work the brakes and ensure the suspension is working, and then to the airport in Colmar, France where a Bugatti test driver takes each car over 186 mph on the taxiway \u2014 during pauses in airplane traffic, naturally.\nAfter a more leisurely drive back from the airport, the customer\u2019s brand-new wheels and tires installed and it\u2019s driven for another 30 miles to make sure everything is mechanically perfect. But it\u2019s still not ready for delivery just yet.\nDuring testing, the vehicle has lots of protective elements installed to keep the body panels and interior from being damaged. After the protection is removed, the car goes to the paint lab inside the Atelier where a technician spends two days polishing the entire car. Then each car receives a six-hour product audit, where a single technician examines every square inch of the car for scratches or damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery imperfection is marked and repaired, and, before the car heads out the door, every manager \u2014 quality, production, sales, after sales, the general manager of the Atelier \u2014 examines the car in the light tunnel before giving final sign off for delivery.\nAnd then the whole process is repeated once or twice per week. With the company expecting to produce around 70 Chiron cars per year, the full run of 500 vehicles should be completed by 2024.\n"}
