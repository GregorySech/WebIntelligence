{"title": "A closer look at Sony\u2019s wireless earbuds vs. Apple\u2019s AirPods", "content": " \nWireless earbuds are the future, if you believe Apple or Bragi. Today at IFA in Germany, Sony is experimenting with the future with its own truly wireless earbuds. I personally own the AirPods and I think they make you look stupid, so I naturally had to compare the two immediately. Dubbed WF-1000X, the earbuds should last around 3 hours per charge, which is less than Apple\u2019s 5 hours which is usually a pretty accurate estimate.\nSony\u2019s charging case, which is a lot bigger than Apple\u2019s, will only provide an additional two charges (that\u2019s 9 hours total vs. 24 hours with the AirPods). These obvious differences aside, Sony\u2019s wireless earbuds also include noise cancellation, which is a great feature if you\u2019re commuting or in a noisy environment. I tried out Sony\u2019s earbuds and they fit comfortably enough, but feel like they\u2019re sticking straight out of your ears like a Bluetooth headset.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tested out the noise cancellation and I was impressed, even in the noisy and busy area at Sony\u2019s booth at IFA in Germany. You can pick between straight noise cancellation, which blocked out most of the sounds and people around me talking, or you can pick ambient sound which lets you hear some sounds around you while you\u2019re listening to music. That\u2019s a useful option to pick from Sony\u2019s app if you\u2019re walking in a city and want to hear potential hazards around you.\nSony is using microUSB for charging, which seems like an odd move considering the company\u2019s new XZ1 handsets both use USB-C. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s AirPods use the company\u2019s Lightning connector so you only have to carry around one cable to charge your phone and wireless headphones. Sony is also releasing its truly wireless earbuds in September priced at $199.99, which is $30 more than Apple\u2019s AirPods but around the same time as you can currently buy Bragi Dash earbuds.\n"}
