{"title": "Netflix will explore mobile-specific cuts of its original series", "content": " \nNetflix chief product officer Neil Hunt said in a briefing today with journalists in San Francisco that the company plans to explore streaming mobile-specific cuts of its original movies and TV shows, to satisfy what he said was a growing audience of mobile Netflix watchers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable that you could take a master [copy] and make a different cut for mobile,\u201d Hunt said. To date, Netflix hasn\u2019t been delivering different cuts for different viewing platforms, Hunt said, but \u201cit\u2019s something we will explore over the next few years.\u201d\nThe idea to be would be to create a version of the content with scenes or shots that are more easily visible or immersive on a mobile phone, since certain shots can be hard to see or can appear diminished on a relatively small phone screen. \nHunt, who has been with Netflix since 1999 and is one of the company\u2019s top executives, made the remarks as part of a two-day event at Dolby Laboratories and Netflix\u2019s own headquarters, as the two companies gear up for the launch of Iron Fist. Much of the conversation so far has centered around the series being shot natively in HDR, a method that offers a more dynamic range of colors on the TV or movie screen in front of you. But Hunt, along with Dolby executives, emphasized that HDR isn\u2019t just for big-screen viewing.\nIt\u2019s been about a year since Netflix became available globally (with the exception of a few markets, including China) and since then it has seen mobile usage soar. In established markets like the US and Canada, most Netflix watching still happens on TVs, Hunt said; but in some Asian countries, especially India, \u201cmobile screens are the majority consumption device.\u201d \n\n\n\n"}
