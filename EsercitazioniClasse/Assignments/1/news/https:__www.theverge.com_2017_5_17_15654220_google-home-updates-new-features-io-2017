{"title": "The 6 big updates coming to Google Home", "content": " \nGoogle announced a few big updates for the Google Home today. None of them are game-changing on their own, but they all add up to a substantial update for the connected speaker. Details are pretty basic right now, and Google didn\u2019t say when any of these features would arrive, but here\u2019s the gist of what\u2019s coming up for the Home.\nNotifications\nGoogle calls this feature \u201cproactive assistance.\u201d Essentially, Google Home will do its best to alert owners to things they need to know, like reminders, traffic alerts, or flight delays.\nAt launch, these are going to be really basic \u2014 it sounds like the Home won\u2019t support notifications for much more than that. The limitation may be to prevent people from getting overloaded right away and give up on notifications altogether.\nGoogle is keeping notifications pretty subtle, too. The Home\u2019s light ring will begin spinning around, without making a sound, when there\u2019s an alert. Owners will just have to say, \u201cOK Google, what\u2019s up?\u201d to hear what it has for them.\nFree calling to phones in US and Canada\nAmazon just introduced calling through the Echo \u2014 but that was only to other Echo devices. Google is one-upping Amazon by letting the Home dial out to actual landline and mobile phones. Whenever this feature rolls out, you\u2019ll be able to ask the Home to call anyone on your contacts list, and it\u2019ll dial out to them on a private number.\nBecause Home does voice recognition, it\u2019ll be able to figure out which person\u2019s contact list to use when looking up who to call.\nUnfortunately, it sounds like this feature is only coming to the US and Canada for now, so everyone else will have to wait on this one.\nCalendar and reminders\nYou can finally set reminders and calendar entries. Finally.\nMore streaming services\nGoogle Home has already been able to control a handful of music and video services, but it\u2019s about to get a bunch of major missing names. For music, that includes Spotify\u2019s free tier, Deezer, and SoundCloud. For video, it includes HBO Now and Hulu. On top of that, Home is also getting the ability to stream anything over Bluetooth.\nAltogether, these new integrations should make the speaker much more useful as a central media controller. While it can already do select services, you can\u2019t really rely on the Home right now if you use a variety of streaming apps. Increasingly, it looks like you\u2019ll just be able to ask the Home to do something and know it\u2019ll work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA TV interface\nSometimes you actually want to see what\u2019s going on, so Google\u2019s making a TV interface for the Google Home. You\u2019ll soon be able to ask the Home to send information to your TV, from basics like the weather and your calendar, to information it\u2019s looking up like nearby restaurants or YouTube videos you might want to watch.\nGoogle also says that \"over time\u201d it\u2019s going to bring the Assistant integrations that third parties build to the TV.\nNew locations\nThe Home is going to expand to five new countries this summer: Canada, Australia, France, Germany, and Japan.\n"}
