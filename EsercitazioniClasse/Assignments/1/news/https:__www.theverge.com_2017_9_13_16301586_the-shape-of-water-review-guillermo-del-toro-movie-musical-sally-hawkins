{"title": "Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Shape of Water is the year\u2019s most sentimental fish romance", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review comes from the Toronto International Film Festival.\nWriter-director Guillermo del Toro has always been fascinated by ghosts. Sometimes those ghosts are literal \u2014 in his movies Crimson Peak and The Devil\u2019s Backbone, they\u2019re the shades of the dead, actively seeking vengeance against those who wronged them. In other films, like his Hellboy movies or Pacific Rim, the ghosts are more metaphorical: representations of unfinished business, traumas that haunt people, or family connections that won\u2019t go away. In Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, the past takes on multiple dangerous forms; in Cronos, it\u2019s just one aging man. This is the theme that connects all of del Toro\u2019s work: the way people carry the past around, and need to move past it to become complete people.\nBut in his latest film, The Shape of Water, his obsession with the power of the past takes on its warmest and most benign form to date. Here, for once, the dead forms who haunt the living aren\u2019t malicious, confused, or angry. They\u2019re much too busy singing and dancing to take a personal interest in the world they\u2019ve departed. They\u2019re the stars of classic movie musicals, and they do haunt the film, giving it form and structure. But for once, the film\u2019s protagonists aren\u2019t trying to escape the past. They\u2019re embracing its sentimentality, its innocence, and above all, its romance.\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nFantasy romance, with a strong, sweet overtone of movie-musical. \nWhat\u2019s it about?\nHappy-Go-Lucky\u2019s Sally Hawkins stars as Eliza, a mute woman with no family or past. She lives according to a pat schedule, which largely revolves around her job and looking after her lonely gay neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). Work for Eliza involves listening to the nonstop patter of her chatty best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and mopping up bathrooms and labs in a secret government facility. The film is set in the late 1950s, the space race is in full swing, and Eliza and Zelda\u2019s employers are obsessed with the Russian advantage in space, and the question of how to stop them.\nThen one agent, the grim Strickland (Michael Shannon) captures a South American fish-man (played, of course, by del Toro\u2019s favorite monster-embodier, Doug Jones). The creature, somewhere between a bigger, more intimidating version of Hellboy\u2019s Abe Sapien (also played by Jones) and the Creature from the Black Lagoon, is chained and abused, and Eliza instantly sympathizes with him and begins bonding with him. Meanwhile, Giles gently pursues a young, muscular counterman at his local diner, tries to get illustration work in a world that\u2019s moved away from his Norman Rockwell style of art, and obsessively watches old black-and-white musicals like That Night in Rio and Hello, Frisco, Hello. These films give The Shape of Water a constant backdrop of nostalgia and melancholy romance, two things that heavily influence Eliza as she approaches her monster with longing instead of fear. Meanwhile, Strickland approaches it with sadistic fury, and plans to see it vivisected \u2014 ostensibly for vague reasons involving the space race, but mostly because he\u2019s more of a monster than it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIFF\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nThis is a Guillermo del Toro film. It\u2019s about the past. Specifically, it\u2019s about Eliza\u2019s mysterious, inscrutable past, and how it affects her present choices. It\u2019s about the way Zelda\u2019s sullen husband isn\u2019t the handsome young man he used to be, and how he\u2019s become a cranky tyrant who expects her to endlessly cater to him because of their shared history. It\u2019s about the way Giles hangs onto his youth and is baffled by the present, where he\u2019s a tired old relic whose skills are pass\u00e9. And it\u2019s about those emotional, sweet old musicals, where everyone seems endlessly cheery and fulfilled. It\u2019s telling that among the main characters, the ruthlessly evil Strickland is the only one who seems to be thinking about the importance of the future \u2014 specifically, a future where his two-kids-and-a-house-in-the-suburbs version of America is the culturally dominant idea, and filthy, inexplicable things like Eliza\u2019s fish-friend have been wiped out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIFF\n\n\nIs it good?\nFor audiences who like erotic fairy-tales, fantasy, musicals, and Guillermo del Toro in general, it\u2019s unbeatable. The visuals in particular are marvelous, starting with the opening scene \u2014 seen in the trailer \u2014 where Hawkins sleeps in a fully furnished underwater room where nothing seems particularly fixed in place. Del Toro has always been a strong visual stylist who puts intense colors and elaborate settings and costumes on the screen, and here, once again, he gives his story a lush setting and intense tone that both wobble between the breathtakingly beautiful and the grotesque.\nThe grotesque, in particular, takes a couple of forms in The Shape of Water. There\u2019s nothing conventionally erotic about Jones\u2019 fish-man, who secretes a thick slime, has razor-sharp claws, communicates only in clicks and gurgles (some supplied by del Toro himself) and requires nauseatingly polluted water to survive. (Seriously, the chemical additives that make water suitable for him also make it look like chunky green vomit. Del Toro is not out to ease viewers\u2019 stomachs here.) And Shannon as the villain is just as revolting in different ways. He\u2019s obsessed with a certain kind of pure Rockwellian Americana \u2014 sitting in his suburban \u201850s home with his catalog-perfect housewife and two kids, watching The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, he snarls under his breath, \u201cThis is America.\u201d But he\u2019s also a gleeful torturer with his own dark erotic obsessions, and due to an accident with the fish-man early in the film, part of his hand is literally rotting off. \nNo one will accuse del Toro about being too subtle in his intentions here \u2014 Shape of Water is broad and forceful about its symbolism. It\u2019s certainly unmissable that its protagonists are, respectively, a disabled woman, a black woman, and a gay man, while its antagonist is a white man vocally obsessed with purity and patriotism, but hypocritical and monstrous about his own behavior, particularly around sex. All of this is going to be too strident and pointed for some viewers, particularly those who aren\u2019t predisposed to love the kind of nostalgic sentiment del Toro has around the movies. This is the same kind of swoony, romantic vision of Hollywood\u2019s past that shows up in films like The Artist, Hugo, and Wall-E, and filmgoers that rejected those movies have no business here. \nBut for those capable of falling into the spell del Toro is casting, The Shape of Water is a breathless film, anchored by Hawkins\u2019 visible, ardent longing for connection, and her fierce defiance when the things she loves are threatened. Her performance alone would be reason enough to embrace the film, and the supporting cast \u2014 particularly Jenkins with his prickly fussing, and Michael Stuhlbarg as a sympathetic Russian spy \u2014 is tremendous. It\u2019s always clear where The Shape of Water is going, from those opening moments that give away its intentions. But how it gets there, and how it channels its love for the past into its strange and haunting present, is an endless and wonderful surprise.\nWhat should it be rated?\nThere\u2019s a fair bit of decorous but unabashed nudity, erotic situations, torture, and a ton of blood. This isn\u2019t one of those nostalgia-worshiping fish-romance action-thrillers made for kids. It\u2019s a pretty comfortable R.\nHow can I actually watch it?\nThe Shape of Water is scheduled for wide release in America on December 8th, 2017.\n"}
