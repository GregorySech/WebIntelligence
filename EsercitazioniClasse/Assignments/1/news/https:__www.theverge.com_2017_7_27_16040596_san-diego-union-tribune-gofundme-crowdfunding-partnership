{"title": "A San Diego newspaper is partnering with GoFundMe to launch campaigns based on its own articles", "content": " \nEarlier this month, The San Diego Union-Tribune launched an unusual experiment: asking readers to become small-scale philanthropists. Partnering with crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, the paper began adding a small widget to its online articles, providing a link to start a fundraising campaign. \u201cWant to make a difference?\u201d the note asks. \u201cA great way to help people affected by Union-Tribune stories is to start a GoFundMe.\u201d It\u2019s the latest sign of crowdfunding\u2019s massive cultural influence \u2014 but does it belong in the fourth estate?\nThe Union-Tribune apparently approached GoFundMe about the program, which has been running since July 12th. Publisher and editor Jeff Light said that it\u2019s supposed to be an alternative for readers who email reporters to ask how they can help someone in a Union-Tribune story. The two organizations split the 5 percent fee that GoFundMe charges, with the Union-Tribune donating its share to unspecified charitable programs. In theory, it\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. GoFundMe gets a new lead generation system, the paper provides a service readers have asked for, and subjects of its stories \u2014 like an unemployed man who returned a lost money order \u2014 get financial help. Or at least, that\u2019s the idea.\n\u201cI see this arrangement leading to headaches down the proverbial road.\u201d\nIn practice, it\u2019s a well-intentioned program with hidden risks that don\u2019t seem fully examined. The Union-Tribune is relying on GoFundMe to police fraud and improper use, but scams can still get through, and even good-faith projects can turn out badly. Beneficiaries who are on Supplemental Security Income, for example, can lose benefits if they get too much money through crowdfunding. Journalist Melissa Gira Grant, who called the experiment \u201cdeeply misguided,\u201d noted that strangers could miss important details about a subject\u2019s life or situation \u2014 which might not be mentioned in the story.\nAny fundraising effort could run into these issues, but on GoFundme, it\u2019s especially easy to promote a cause without considering its ramifications. It takes only a few minutes to build a campaign, and GoFundMe\u2019s tips focus almost exclusively on boosting a campaign\u2019s visibility rather than judging its merits, though some guidelines are posted on the site. If newspapers are supposed to ensure accuracy and avoid harm in their stories, does that responsibility extend to the crowdfunding campaigns they\u2019re encouraging?\nAndrew Seaman, ethics committee chair for the Society of Professional Journalists, says the whole project makes him \u201ca bit uneasy.\u201d What happens, he asks, if readers end up creating a bunch of competing campaigns for the same goal? What if new reporting casts an old article\u2019s subject in a different light, or changes their story? \u201cMy suggestion would be for the paper to instead come up with a policy that addresses when it's appropriate to include links to fundraising campaigns,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cI see this arrangement leading to headaches down the proverbial road.\u201d\nLight agrees there are potential downsides, but he thinks the idea of duplicate campaigns is fine, because it might put the same cause in front of more people. He also tells The Verge that simply having campaigns associated with the Union-Tribune could help people hold them to higher standards. \u201cWhen something in our report doesn\u2019t smell right, GoFundMe or no, we hear about it pretty quickly. And we have the wherewithal to follow up,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA GoFundMe campaign embedded on the Union-Tribune\u2019s site.\n\n\nLight says the Union-Tribune\u2019s GoFundMe integration isn\u2019t complete, so they\u2019re not totally sure how many campaigns have been made through the widget. The Union-Tribune has a page featuring GoFundMe campaigns related to its stories, but most of them predate the announcement. The most successful project so far has raised $30,000 (of a $50,000 goal) for Iesha Booker, a bus driver who stepped in to help an injured police officer. Others are considerably smaller: an LGBTQ student filmmaker contest has gotten $300, and donors have given around $1,800 to the family of recently deceased motorcyclist Leslie Elliot. \u201cIt looks like a very quiet start to the whole initiative \u2014 way less activity that I would expect to see,\u201d Light admits. \u201cBut I\u2019m confident we will see stronger take-up going forward.\u201d\nTo some extent, the paper seems to be figuring out its strategy on the fly. Some campaigns \u2014 like the one for Booker \u2014 get manually embedded in the articles that inspired them, but Light says he\u2019s going to see about adding a feature where people can automatically link campaigns with news reports. \u201cThere are a lot of stories being written every day, and a lot of campaigns being started, so I don\u2019t think our staff would be able to keep up with linking them together,\u201d he says.\nShould a newspaper vet its readers\u2019 philanthropy?\nThis seems like it would raise its own issues. A link could make more readers likely to find the campaign and donate, but should a paper implicitly endorse projects it hasn\u2019t vetted? Given how often people use GoFundMe for morally dubious causes, would crowdfunding campaigns become the new internet comment, minimally moderated and sometimes noxious? On the other hand, the Union-Tribune also has a unique opportunity to make people better crowdfunders, offering readers the ethical and practical guidelines that GoFundMe tends to gloss over. When I raised this possibility with Light, he liked the idea and mulled adding tips to the Union-Tribune\u2019s simple GoFundMe FAQ \u2014 emphasizing how nascent the whole project really is.\nCrowdfunding platforms have stepped in to fill a patchy social safety net, but they\u2019re still private businesses with their own goals, not simply a conduit for charity. That makes some of the Union-Tribune\u2019s descriptions sound as much like advertising as philanthropy. \u201cI think [the widget] helps our users to understand the utility of the GoFundMe idea if they are not familiar with it, and it connects readers to another dimension of the story,\u201d says Light. If the end result is money getting to worthy causes, that\u2019s great. But if journalism and crowdfunding keep intertwining, things will almost certainly get more complicated than that.\n"}
