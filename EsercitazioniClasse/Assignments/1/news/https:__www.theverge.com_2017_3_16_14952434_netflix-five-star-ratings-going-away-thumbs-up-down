{"title": "Netflix is ditching five-star ratings in favor of a thumbs-up", "content": " \nNetflix will soon be changing its ratings system for the first time in several years, switching from a traditional five-star rating to a thumbs-up / thumbs-down system, Netflix vice president of product Todd Yellin said in a press briefing today. \n\u201cFive stars feels very yesterday now,\u201d Yellin said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending many billions of dollars on the titles we\u2019re producing and licensing, and with these big catalogs, that just adds a challenge.\u201d He added that \u201cbubbling up the stuff people actually want to watch is super important.\u201d \n\u201cFive stars feels very yesterday now.\u201d\nYellin said the change will happen in April, and will roll out globally. (Some customers may still see star ratings in your Netflix account for a short while longer.) \nIt was reported last year that Netflix was looking to move away from its old way of rating shows and movies, when the company began beta testing the \u201cthumbs.\u201d It rolled out the interface change to hundreds of thousands of new Netflix users around the world, while other members saw the old interface with stars. After sitting back for a few months, Yellin said, the company observed that over 200 percent more ratings were logged, cementing the decision to change the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lauren Goode / The Verge\n\n\nSwitching to a binary thumbs-up / thumbs-down system might seem less granular than offering five stars, but Yellin said there\u2019s an implicit understanding with thumbs-up / thumbs-down that people are doing it to improve their own experience rather than trying to rate it for the rest of the world. And at the end of the day, it\u2019s really about just getting more people to rate things. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s more powerful: you telling me you would give five stars to the documentary about unrest in the Ukraine; that you\u2019d give three stars to the latest Adam Sandler movie; or that you\u2019d watch the Adam Sandler movie 10 times more frequently?\u201d Yellin said. \u201cWhat you do versus what you say you like are different things.\u201d  \nNetflix is rolling out personalized percent matching\nIn addition to the ratings change, Netflix will also start percent matching, which means it will use algorithms to show a percentage below a title based on how likely it is you\u2019ll like it. This is personalized, Yellin said, not unlike dating sites that match you with potential partners based on interests or earlier activity. \nAnother interesting point on this: Netflix is \u201cmatching\u201d members based on a global database of activity, not segmenting it by local markets. The company found that its customers are surprisingly willing to watch Netflix content that has been produced in other countries or has subtitles. \u201cWe\u2019re finding these clusters of people and then we\u2019re figuring out who is like you, who enjoys these kinds of things, and then we\u2019re mixing and matching those,\u201d Yellin explained. \n"}
