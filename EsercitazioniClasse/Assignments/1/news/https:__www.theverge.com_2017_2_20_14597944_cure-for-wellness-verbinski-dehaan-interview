{"title": "The director of A Cure for Wellness on the unforgettable dental scene", "content": " \nA Cure for Wellness is one of the most peculiar studio films of recent memory. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) uses a decadent 146-minute runtime to thread together Cronenbergian body horror, universal movie monster villainy, a coffee table book\u2019s worth of beautiful photography, and a handful of plot twists that are at once bizarre and predictable. The film is hardly perfect, but it\u2019s memorable \u2014 particularly one scene involving poorly done dental work.\nYes, this is your spoiler warning. Dane DeHaan (The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Chronicle) plays the young Wall Street climber named Lockhart who is sent to a mysterious Swiss sanatorium to collect and return one of his company\u2019s senior executives. The spa performs suspicious, anachronistic health practices on wealthy CEO types. These titans of industry want to be absolved of their inner \u201csickness.\u201d\nThis is a horror-thriller. Of course the sanatorium\u2019s practices aren\u2019t quite so voluntary. Late in the film, Lockhart, searching for answers behind the declining health of the guests, finds himself on the receiving end of what the film treats as a dental tool, but looks like the sort of drill used in a heist to bust a vault.\n\nThe top image is from the moment just before the drill enters the frame. One of Lockhart\u2019s teeth has already fallen out (I won\u2019t spoil why). The drill drives through another of his healthy teeth with a sound that\u2019s both crackly and gushy, like a pail of water thrown on raging fire.\nMuch of the sequence, surprisingly was shot with practical effects.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no CG in that sequence,\u201d DeHaan tells The Verge.\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s some compositing,\u201d Verbinksi adds.\n\u201cI was actually strapped into that chair,\u201d says DeHaan. \u201cThat thing was actually prying my mouth open, and albeit a rubber drill, there was a drill really close to my face. So in a lot of ways that was one of the easier scenes to act. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to react going into it, but it turned out I just kind of squealed like a pig and [Verbinski] kind of loved it. And it was, for me, an incredibly real experience.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Verbinski, \u201cthere were really guys in white suits speaking German, holding drills, that were maybe perhaps untrained and getting a little too close to Dane. So yeah, I don\u2019t want to say no acting required, but it wasn\u2019t like \u2018look at the green X.\u2019\n\u201cI think we\u2019re sort of hardwired in our DNA [...] there\u2019s something about dental work that\u2019s particularly horrifying. In the same way we\u2019re kind of designed to respond to things that slither, I think there\u2019s just something about that sound when you\u2019re in the chair, and they\u2019re actually drilling your teeth. As numbed as you may be, there\u2019s a very specific sound. Or you know, seeing the smoke of dental work start to appear in your eye-line. And your mouth\u2019s wide open and there\u2019s somebody with a mask. Yeah, it\u2019s very specific, you know, and that\u2019s what gives [the moment] its value.\u201d\nThe film is oddly fixated on Lockhart\u2019s teeth. The film\u2019s final twist is the final freeze frame, a smiling Lockhart with all of his teeth intact. Verbinski has spoken about the film\u2019s dream logic, that certain things are unknowable. But I was curious if DeHaan had a theory about his character\u2019s swift dental recovery?\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing in the movie I didn\u2019t have to think about in terms of what it means, what it represents,\u201d says DeHaan, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the end of the movie. Gore and I tried a couple different things, and I think it\u2019s cool because it\u2019s one last surprise, and it\u2019s one last question, and it\u2019s why the cure has side effects and will linger. And it will cause conversations, because [...] there is a surprise in this movie around every corner up until the very last second.\u201d\n\n"}
