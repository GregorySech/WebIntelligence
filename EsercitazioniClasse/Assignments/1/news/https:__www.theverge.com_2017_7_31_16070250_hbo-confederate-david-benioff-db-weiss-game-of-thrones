{"title": "HBO responds to #NoConfederate controversy: \u2018We hope that people will reserve judgment\u2019", "content": " \nTwo weeks ago, Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss announced they were making an alternative history drama called Confederate, about an America where slavery still exists. Also working on the show are producers Nichelle Tramble Spellman (The Good Wife) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire). The internet immediately deemed this a terrible idea, with a wave of negative comments, followed by a Twitter campaign built around the hashtag #NoConfederate. Benioff and Weiss\u2019 defense has been that the show isn\u2019t out yet, so the verdict shouldn\u2019t be either.\nThey acknowledged in an interview with Vulture that they\u2019re dealing with weapons-grade controversial material here. And there\u2019s a reason viewers don\u2019t trust the idea: Benioff and Weiss are both white, and they don\u2019t have the best track record of depicting race on Game of Thrones. On that show, most people of color are slaves or slavers. The show\u2019s history of graphically depicted sexual assault has also been controversial. As critics have pointed out, sexual attacks on slaves were frequent and institutional, which raises concerns about Confederate sexualizing slavery and power in the same way Game of Thrones does. Both the race problem and the sex problem are built into George R.R. Martin\u2019s source novels, but Benioff and Weiss\u2019 show has fetishized violence and coercion, even past the books\u2019 level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA problematic scene from Game of Thrones where Daenerys is presented as the savior of some of the only people of color on the show.\n\n\n\n\nThe same guys who have gratuitous depictions of rape & no significant POC characters are going to handle the enslavement of Blacks w/ nuance https://t.co/Xe0vh6pQiy\u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\nAfter Twitter\u2019s #NoConfederate rally on Sunday night during Game of Thrones, HBO released a statement, saying, \u201cWe have great respect for the dialogue and concern being expressed around Confederate. We have faith that [writers] Nichelle, Dan, David and Malcolm will approach the subject with care and sensitivity. The project is currently in its infancy so we hope that people will reserve judgment until there is something to see.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the same argument made by defenders of the show, who believe the idea just sounds worse than it will actually look upon airing. In the original press release announcing the show, Benioff and Weiss said they\u2019d been sitting on the idea for years: \u201cThere won\u2019t be dragons or White Walkers in this series, but we are creating a world, and we couldn\u2019t imagine better partners in world-building than Nichelle and Malcolm, who have impressed us for a long time with their wit, their imagination and their Scrabble-playing skills.\u201d\n#NoConfederate has been trending since 9PM on Sunday, to coincide with Game of Thrones\u2019 air time, when Twitter is usually blowing up with Game of Thrones hashtags. The campaign was orchestrated by Rebecca Theodore, Shanelle Little, Lauren Warren, and Jamie Broadnax, along with April Reign, a social media activist who also started the conversation-changing #OscarsSoWhite tag.\n\n\nI want y'all to understand what we did. Five Black women announced on Friday that we would have #NoConfederate trending on Sunday at 9p.\u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n#NoConfederate because the terror of white supremacy is a reality for POC. This shouldn't even have to be a hashtag in 2017.\u2014 Jay Coles (@mrjaycoles) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n#NoConfederate bc the same people that say \"let it go, and move forward\" about slavery are the same ones that want this show\u2014 Neysha (@La_Ney_sha) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n#NoConfederate is basically:White ppl: omg... what if... white supremacy....was still real????!?!?! could you imagine??!?!?!?Black ppl: pic.twitter.com/wT8cobNAd2\u2014 black history heaux (@localblactivist) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Black children deserve to grow up in a country that won't air confederacy fantasies on tv #NoConfederate\u2014 Dr. Chanda    (@IBJIYONGI) July 31, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
