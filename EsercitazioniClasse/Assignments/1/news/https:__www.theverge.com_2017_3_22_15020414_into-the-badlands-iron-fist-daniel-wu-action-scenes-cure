{"title": "Into the Badlands is the perfect cure for your Iron Fist blues", "content": " \nLast weekend, Marvel premiered Iron Fist, its latest live-action Netflix show. To the disappointment of many fans, the series isn\u2019t very good. Fortunately, there\u2019s a solution if Iron Fist\u2019s dull plot, poor characters, and Finn Jones\u2019 single confused facial expression left you with a craving for some serious martial arts mayhem: AMC\u2019s Into the Badlands. While it may have gotten lost in the hype surrounding Marvel\u2019s new series, Badlands, which returned for its second season last weekend, delivers on the core promise that Iron Fist fails to live up to. \nWhile there are several problems with Iron Fist, one of the biggest is that the show seems almost ashamed of the fact that its main character is supposed to be the world\u2019s greatest martial artist who can literally level walls with a magical glowing punch. I\u2019ve been slogging my way through the series for a few days, and it takes almost two full hours before Iron Fist actually wields the damn Iron Fist. (To put that in perspective, that\u2019s longer than the entire run time of Thor: The Dark World, which, while not one of Marvel\u2019s best films, is still far better than Iron Fist.)\nInto the Badlands has no such compunctions. Now, it isn\u2019t the greatest show: it\u2019s campy, the politics can be dull, and the acting is often stilted and awkward. But the action is consistently incredible. The story follows Sunny (Daniel Wu), a \u201cClipper\u201d \u2014 the show\u2019s term for the samurai-like soldiers \u2014 who fights to defend his Baron from the warriors roaming the show\u2019s post-apocalyptic wasteland. And the fights themselves are stunning. Unlike Finn Jones, whose limited martial arts ability was a liability that the Iron Fist creative team had to overcome, Wu \u2014 who also serves as executive producer for the show \u2014 is a trained martial artist with many years of experience. That means that Wu can perform lots of his own stunts and fights, and, equally as important, lets the camera take a wider approach to actually allow viewers to see the action instead of trying to hide stuntmen stand-ins through close camera work and rapid cuts.\n\nWorld-building is another area where Badlands excels. Instead of yet another take on the played-out \u201cwhite billionaire playboy superhero\u201d trope, Badlands is set in a weird post-apocalyptic future, mixing styles from the Antebellum South, feudal Japan, and a Mad Max-style wasteland. Added to that mix is an order of mysterious magical warriors, including a new character this season (who coincidentally wields overpowered punches and healing powers through a glowing fist) who are played by a diverse collection of actors and fighters.\nIs Into the Badlands the perfect alternative to Marvel\u2019s prestige projects? No. But it\u2019s not pretending to be. And most importantly, where it excels, it blows the competition out of the water. The second season already wastes zero time in throwing Sunny into a fantastic and brutal fight scene that feels like a cross between the stylistic violence of Kill Bill and the creative stuntwork of Jackie Chan. And there are still plenty of ways in which it\u2019s improving episode to episode. If Iron Fist left you with an itch for a proper martial arts action show, it exists. And it\u2019s on Netflix, too.\n"}
