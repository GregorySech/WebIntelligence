{"title": "LG releases first G6 TV commercial on eve of Samsung\u2019s big event", "content": " \nLG has to be hoping that come tomorrow, its brand new G6 smartphone won\u2019t be immediately overshadowed in the minds of consumers by Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8. The two phones are similar in that they\u2019re both all screen with a tiny surrounding bezel. Each has its own advantages; in the case of LG, that\u2019s really the wide-angle camera lens on the back (and a flat display, if you\u2019re a traditionalist like me). \nBut for its first TV spot meant to sell you (and millions of other people) on the G6, the company is really focused on that screen and its friendliness to one-handed use thanks to a 2:1 aspect ratio. It starts by peeling off what you\u2019d expect a traditional phone\u2019s bezel to look like, and the tagline is \u201cThe big screen that fits in your hand.\u201d And yeah, it\u2019s definitely easier to navigate around this phone than some others. Good luck reaching the back button in this Gilt example, though. Please, developers, no more hamburger menus (or any important buttons) up there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a very brief look at the camera in the skydiving scene, but I expect LG will have other ads for showcasing its unique dual-lens setup. And this spot also effectively gets across the device\u2019s water resistance. But will any amount of advertising be enough against the Samsung juggernaut? The G6 launches on March 30th on Verizon and a week later on other US carriers, so it\u2019s got some lead time. But after tomorrow\u2019s event, a lot of people might already have their minds set on a certain new Galaxy with its own giant, curved screen. \n"}
