Spotted by Android Police, the feature is currently available in the experimental Canary build of the browser. \nGoogle\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Beaufort announced the addition this morning, noting that the Chrome team is still \u201cexperimenting with a setting to mute / unmute a website directly from the Page Info bubble.\u201d\nCurrently you can mute tabs in Chrome tabs by right clicking on them, but the process is cancelled out once you close the tab or Chrome. Once this feature makes its way from Canary to the public build of Chrome, which will take a few weeks at the least, you\u2019ll be able to put websites on permanent lockdown with just a few clicks. \n"}
