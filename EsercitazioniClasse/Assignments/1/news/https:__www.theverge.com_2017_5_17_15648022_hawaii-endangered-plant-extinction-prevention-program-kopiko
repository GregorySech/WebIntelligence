{"title": "The scientists saving Hawaii's rarest plants need to be saved", "content": " \nFour thousand feet above sea level in Hawaii\u2019s Koke\u02bbe State Park, the weather is drier and cooler than the island of Kaua\u02bbi below. Unlike the lowland, where invasive species dominate the landscape, there\u2019s a forest of mostly native trees and plants all around us. \u201cIt\u2019s very pleasant to walk in,\u201d says Steve Perlman. A field botanist who\u2019s been at the forefront of protecting Hawaii\u2019s endangered plants for over 40 years, he\u2019s known for rappelling from ridges to find rare plants. In 2014, he joined the Plant Extinction Prevention Program (PEPP), which focuses on protecting Hawaiian plants that only have fewer than 50 individuals left in the wild. \nWe arrive at a spot where the trail enlarges a bit and is covered in gravel. The gravel was put there after the trail flooded and hikers began piercing another trail through the forest, unknowingly walking over rare and precious native plants. Perlman points one out \u2014 it\u2019s small and frail, with a beautiful, elongated white flower and over 10 buds. It\u2019s called Psychotria grandiflora, or Kopiko, and there are only 30 or so plants left on Kaua\u02bbi, the only Hawaiian island where it grows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trail in Kaua\u02bbi\u2019s Koke\u02bbe State Park.\nPhoto by Alessandra Potenza / The Verge\n\n\nKopiko is in danger for a variety of reasons \u2014 it has to compete with voracious weeds that are not native to Hawaii, as well as deal with non-native pigs, goats, and deer that love munching on its leaves, and rats eating its seeds. Most of the plants that are left are also female, Perlman says, so it\u2019s hard for them to get pollinated by rare male plants. If they\u2019re not pollinated, they can\u2019t make fruits and seeds to reproduce themselves. This is where Perlman and PEPP come in. \nWith help from a botanist in Japan, Perlman and his colleagues have been hand-pollinating the remaining Psychotria grandiflora by collecting viable pollen from male plants and dabbing it onto the female flowers, allowing them to reproduce. This plant, with the beautiful white flower we\u2019re looking at along the trail, is a natural offspring of that artificial pollination. And it\u2019s safe to say that, if it weren\u2019t for PEPP, this plant species maybe would have been extinct in the wild by now. \nPsychotria grandiflora is just one example. There are currently 238 plant species that PEPP is trying to save from extinction. But the future of PEPP itself is in peril. Since its beginning in the early 2000s, the program has been funded by mostly federal money; the budget varied year to year, but it was about $1 million, says Joan Yoshioka, Hawaii\u2019s statewide PEPP manager. The bulk of that money \u2014 about 70 to 90 percent \u2014 came from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, she says, as well as other federal grants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBotanist Steve Perlman has been at the forefront of protecting Hawaii\u2019s endangered plants for over 40 years.\nPhoto by Alessandra Potenza / The Verge\n\n\nIn the last year alone, however, the FWS funding has been cut by 50 percent, to about $500,000. And come October, when the new fiscal year begins, Yoshioka is expecting more cuts \u2014 possibly another 50 percent. (Including all sources of revenue, PEPP raised only 75 percent of its budget, Yoshioka says.) Perlman\u2019s helicopter budget \u2014 around $50,000 \u2014 has already been slashed, he says. He desperately needs that money to access rare species that only grow on steep cliffs where no cars can get to. Without the federal money, saving endangered species will be a real challenge. \u201cIt may mean we might lose species,\u201d Yoshioka says. \u201cThat\u2019s just the reality of it.\u201d\nThe cuts aren\u2019t only coming from the Fish and Wildlife Service, either. PEPP has seen its budget from the state of Hawaii decrease as well, Yoshioka says. And private grants are becoming harder to get. \u201cWe\u2019ve received cuts across the board,\u201d she says. \nExtinction prevention programs like PEPP are key for protecting our endangered species \u2014 and Hawaii needs it more than any other US state. Hawaii is an island ecosystem, which means that its unique plants evolved isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years. They\u2019re incredibly vulnerable because they don\u2019t have the defense mechanisms to ward off invasive weeds and animals that were introduced on the islands by people. Several types of mint found in Hawaii, for example, don\u2019t have the distinctive mint taste that the plant has in the continental US, because they didn\u2019t evolve having to defend themselves from grazing animals that are usually repelled by that mint taste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeral pigs are a menace to Hawaii\u2019s native plants.\nPhoto by Alessandra Potenza / The Verge\n\n\nSince Hawaii was inhabited, first by the Polynesians and then by Europeans, the islands have lost over 130 plant species, Yoshioka says. Today, the state \u2014 which is dubbed \u201cthe endangered species capital of the world\u201d \u2014 is home to more than 40 percent of all endangered and threatened plant species in the United States. Before PEPP was created, one plant species a year went extinct on average. But since then, the program has been able to save all of the plants it\u2019s been working on, Yoshioka says. Some of them barely exist in the wild anymore, but they live in enclosed areas where voracious pigs and deer are fenced out, or they live on in nurseries around the world. \n\u201cOne of the core values of the PEP program in particular is that it\u2019s been very successful,\u201d says Loyal Mehrhoff, the endangered species recovery director at the Center for Biological Diversity, who worked as a field supervisor at the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Pacific Islands Office in Hawaii. During his years at the FWS, Mehrhoff helped create and then fund PEPP. \nTake Brighamia insignis, a critically endangered plant that has the unusual shape of a miniature palm tree with cabbage-like leaves at the top and yellow flowers. This plant can only be found in Hawaii, and, in fact, there\u2019s only one plant left in the wild on the island of Kaua\u02bbi, Perlman says. The problem is that goats love their leaves, rats eat their seeds, invasive weeds overgrow them, and they\u2019re pollinated by a very rare, large native moth called the fabulous green sphinx moth. When Perlman began working as a botanist in the mid-1970s, there were probably around 150 Brighamia insignis plants, he says. He began collecting the seeds and growing them at the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Kaua\u02bbi, as well as sending seeds to dozens of botanical gardens around the world. Today, more than 100,000 Brighamia insignis plants are grown in cultivation all over the world, he says, including in Belgium, where people love them as houseplants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrighamia insignis plants grown in one of the National Tropical Botanical Garden\u2019s nurseries in Kaua\u02bbi.\nPhoto by Alessandra Potenza / The Verge\n\n\nPerlman and Yoshioka recognize that it\u2019s easy to see the work that PEPP does as a lost cause \u2014 a bunch of Don Quixotes tilting at windmills. Even for \u201csuccess stories\u201d like that of the Brighamia insignis, the plants are basically extinct in the wild. \u201cYou could be overwhelmed and just go, \u2018What\u2019s the use? Either a rat or disease or something is gonna get it, there\u2019s just no point,\u2019\u201d Perlman says. \u201cBut for those of us who love these species and really are trying, you just do the best you can.\u201d Hawaii\u2019s plants are more resilient than people think, he says. Most of these plants arrived in these islands in the middle of the Pacific in one seed only, brought by the wind. They were selected to survive even when they\u2019re in extremely low numbers. So even when there\u2019s just a couple of plants left in the wild, there\u2019s hope they will rebound.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of them are lost causes,\u201d Yoshioka says. \u201cYou can go from one plant to a self-sustaining population. We\u2019ve seen that time and time again.\u201d\nBut without PEPP\u2019s work, these plants honestly don\u2019t have much of a chance. We can\u2019t eradicate rats, weeds, or the feral pigs and goats that are destroying the native flora. We can\u2019t bring the islands back to what they were before humans arrived. So these plants need our help to survive. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all over the world: we irreversibly transformed landscapes,\u201d Yoshioka says. \u201cI think it\u2019s the responsibility we each feel for preserving what remains, not only for us but future generations. It\u2019d be horrendous if it was lost in a very short time frame.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBotanist Steve Perlman overlooking a cliff in Koke\u02bbe State Park.

The PEPP staff is already down to 11 people, and Yoshioka expects there may be layoffs. The funding situation at the federal level isn\u2019t expected to get any better, either. Though the cuts began during the previous administration, President Donald Trump is requesting a 12 percent cut to the Interior Department, which oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service. Trump has also made it pretty clear in his first few months in office that he\u2019s dismissive of conservation and climate change. \u201cOur federal funding levels are decreasing and so our ability to continue to provide financial support to our partners is shrinking as federal budgets shrink,\u201d says Miel Corbett, the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s deputy assistant regional director of external affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the overall budget situation at the federal level.\u201d\nYoshioka says she\u2019s grateful for the all the support PEPP has been receiving from the federal government. Her plan now is to try to find more private donors who\u2019re willing to invest in PEPP\u2019s conservation mission. Winning this extinction battle requires money. \u201cMost people in the United States don\u2019t realize how close to extinctions these plants are,\u201d Mehrhoff says. \u201cThey need to know that there\u2019s a fight going on out here and money helps that fight a lot.\u201d\nThe first step is to make people aware of the program, Yoshioka says, to make sure they understand why unique plants like Psychotria grandiflora and Brighamia insignis are worth saving. And it\u2019s not just them, either. Native animals like insects and birds need the plants as a source of food. Without the plants, the animals go. \u201cThey\u2019re part of one ecosystem,\u201d Yoshioka says. \u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life, we can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d \nUpdate May 17th, 2017 5:55PM ET: The story has been updated to include more information about PEPP\u2019s budget.\n"}
