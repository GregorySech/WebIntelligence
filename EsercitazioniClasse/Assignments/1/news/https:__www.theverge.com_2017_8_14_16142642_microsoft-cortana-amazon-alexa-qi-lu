{"title": "Former Microsoft exec reveals why Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant beat Cortana", "content": " \nMicrosoft\u2019s former AI expert, Qi Lu, moved to Chinese search giant Baidu earlier this year. Lu spent time working on Cortana and Microsoft\u2019s bot platform whilst he was at the software giant, along with heading up the company\u2019s Bing search and Office teams. In an interview with Wired, Lu has provided some rare insight into Microsoft\u2019s struggles to compete with Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant.\n\u201cI worked on Cortana four and a half years ago. At the time we all were like, 'Amazon, yeah, that technology is so far behind,'\u201d says Lu. \u201cGoogle and Microsoft, technologically, were ahead of Amazon by a wide margin. But look at the AI race today. The Amazon Alexa ecosystem is far ahead of anybody else in the United States. It\u2019s because they got the scenario right. They got the device right. Essentially, Alexa is an AI-first device.\u201d\nMicrosoft and Google have focused on the phone instead of a separate device\nLu believes Microsoft and Google \u201cmade the same mistake\u201d of focusing on the phone and PC for voice assistants, instead of a dedicated device. \u201cThe phone, in my view, is going to be, for the foreseeable future, a finger-first, mobile-first device,\u201d explains Lu. \u201cYou need an AI-first device to solidify an emerging base of ecosystems.\u201d\nMicrosoft first introduced Cortana ahead of Alexa as a promising digital assistant for its Windows Phone devices. The software giant has expanded Cortana to be built into Windows 10 for PCs and into the company\u2019s Xbox One console. While Microsoft has so far delivered on the software side, it missed the opportunity to put Cortana into a dedicated device. Harman Kardon is launching a Cortana-powered speaker later this year, and Microsoft is expanding Cortana to many more devices. Cortana will run on various Internet of Things (IoT) devices like fridges, toasters, thermostats, and even cars in Microsoft\u2019s latest bid to catch up and beat Amazon\u2019s popular Alexa voice assistant.\n"}
