{"title": "Now seems like a good time to ask what a smartwatch is", "content": " \nWhat is a smartwatch?\nI\u2019m not asking this question in the literal sense; if I was, I\u2019d be ill-equipped to have written as many smartwatch articles and reviews as I have over the past five years. A lot of us know what a smartwatch is conceptually; at the very least, there\u2019s a vague sense among the general public that a smartwatch is somehow smarter, the way a smartphone is smart, and that techies like to wear them. \nBut with so many connected watches selling now, what actually makes a smartwatch a smartwatch? Is it a specific operating system? The ability to run third-party apps? Or it is simply a watch that can show you notifications from your smartphone? If that\u2019s the case: does it have to look like a watch? Or is a Fitbit a smartwatch ? \nFitbit\u2019s Blaze might best exemplify a product that\u2019s stuck between two product categories, which only underscores that the category itself is still undefined. Fitbit was careful to market the Blaze as a \u201csmart fitness watch\u201d when it first announced it in January 2016. It looks like a smartwatch, it shows notifications like a smartwatch, it has the touchscreen of a smartwatch, but it wasn\u2019t a \u201csmartwatch.\u201d Why not? Fitbit might not have presented it that way because the watch doesn\u2019t run third-party apps the way an Apple Watch or an Android Wear watch does. Or, maybe Fitbit just didn\u2019t want to go head-to-head with Apple \u2014 not that Fitbit\u2019s intentions mattered at all once Wall Street (correctly) assessed that Fitbit was going head-to-head with Apple. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitbit Blaze: don\u2019t call it a \u201csmartwatch.\u201d\n\n\nBut if third-party apps are the differentiator \u2014 that difference between, say, a connected Garmin watch with a transflective display that only runs its own exercise apps, and an Android Wear watch that runs a bunch of different apps on its bright touchscreen display \u2014 then what does that say about Apple Watch, the Fortune 500-sized business that has been losing support from key app makers like Google, Amazon, and eBay? If those third-party apps don\u2019t matter, and the things that matter are the core functions of the watch like time-telling, messaging, fitness-tracking, and payment-making, then wouldn\u2019t that make so many other connected watches \u201csmartwatches,\u201d too? Does that mean a connected Fossil watch, or a Withings watch, is a \u201csmartwatch\u201d? \nI realize I\u2019m posing more questions than I\u2019m answering here, but it\u2019s because the category really is messy at the moment, as small as it may be relative to the PC or smartphone market. I\u2019ve been informally surveying industry insiders about what they think makes a \u201csmartwatch,\u201d and have been surprised by some answers. Recently Ray Maker, of the DC Rainmaker blog, joined the Too Embarrassed to Ask podcast and we geeked out over wearables for over an hour. When I asked him what he considers to be a smartwatch, Maker first acknowledged that the \u201cdefinition keeps on changing for everyone,\u201d but that he ultimately considers a smartwatch \u201canything I get notifications on.\u201d\nHow much do third-party apps really matter?\nCardiogram co-founder Brandon Ballinger says he thinks a smartwatch is something with an app platform. He thinks that people are still \u201cfiguring out which apps suit the format.\u201d He points out that Word or Excel were popular PC apps, but don\u2019t make sense on an iPhone, and that it took a few years for Instagram or Uber to emerge. \n\u201cWe\u2019re still figuring out what the Instagram of Apple Watch will be,\u201d Ballinger concluded. Of course, Cardiogram is an app for Apple Watch, so it makes sense that he would feel that a smartwatch should support third-party apps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, says that for her the \u201csmartness\u201d of a smartwatch isn\u2019t necessarily reliant on the apps ecosystem. Instead, it\u2019s \u201cthe combination of sensors that either help with fitness or context \u2014 say in a smart home environment \u2014 and notifications \u2026 It complements the phone rather than duplicate it.\u201d\nOther analysts and research firms don\u2019t necessarily help clear up the matter. If you look at this late-December report from IDC, which is usually a good place to start, the firm broadly establishes the category as \u201cwearables,\u201d makes separate mentions of the \u201csmartwatch\u201d and \u201cfitness band\u201d categories, and then lumps companies like Xiaomi, Garmin, and Apple in the same group. These companies all make things that go on your wrist. But some are arguably \u201csmartwatches,\u201d and some are definitely not. (Things get even more confusing when you consider that Gartner also puts VR glasses / head-mounted displays into the \u201cwearables\u201d category.) \nUpdate: Jitesh Ubrani, a senior analyst at IDC, later clarified that the firm\u2019s stance has been that smartwatches must have the ability to run third-party apps. \u201cWe include other wearables because consumers don't look at smartwatches in a vacuum,\u201d Ubrani said. \nIt\u2019s possible that the smartwatch category is still waiting for its \u201ciPhone moment.\u201d But if that\u2019s the case: who is BlackBerry right now?\nPersonally, I tend to agree with Ballinger that the difference between a smartwatch and a watch that has some smart features, is that a smartwatch at least has the potential to run third-party apps. Think of Pebble (RIP Pebble): no one questioned if that was a smartwatch; it ran on its own OS, and developers made apps for it. As of today, though, I have yet to experience that one app \u2014 the Instagram \u2014 that makes me think I can\u2019t live without a smartwatch, so I place more value on the core functions of a watch, like the fitness-tracking and battery life of a Garmin or the notifications of an Apple or Android Wear watch.\nIt\u2019s also very possible that the reason why we can\u2019t all agree on a definition of a smartwatch is because it doesn\u2019t exist yet in its most obvious, platonic form. After all, the BlackBerry was arguably a smartphone, but it hardly seemed like one once a \u201creal\u201d smartphone changed the entire category. To compare the current crop of smartwatches to PDAs, though, is both optimistic and foreboding: it means there\u2019s still an opportunity to blow up the smartwatch market, still room for tremendous growth. But if that\u2019s the case, then who is the BlackBerry in this scenario? \n\nPoll\nWhat makes a smartwatch a smartwatch?\n\nThis poll is closed.\n\n\n19%\nIt runs third-party apps\n(566 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n9%\nIt runs its own, built-in apps\n(295 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n40%\nIt wirelessly connects to a smartphone to show you notifications\n(1193 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n23%\nIt has the chip, radios, and sensors of a smartphone, but in a watch\n(704 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n6%\nIt does some math.
