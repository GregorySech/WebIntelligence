{"title": "Spotify\u2019s predictions for Song of the Summer are bumming me out", "content": " \nSpotify released its \u201cofficial\u201d predictions for the song of the summer this morning, and, to be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that it got to pick 15 of them. Anyone can guess the song of the summer if they get 15 tries! \nThe songs were selected using a fascinating combination of vague-sounding scientific techniques. According to a press release, each song was chosen by \u201ctapping the insights of its genre and trend experts, analyzing its streaming data, and considering factors such as a song\u2019s performance on the charts, on key Spotify playlists, and how it\u2019s performing over time.\u201d \nSpotify also \u201cfactored in buzz on social media,\u201d so I\u2019m not sure how we got all the way to the following list without so much as touching on the fact that Justin Bieber says bad, fake Spanish on the #1 track in the United States right now. I\u2019m pretty sure people are just hate-listening to it.  \n\n\nfuck you, justin bieber. your hell is gonna be an 8th grade spanish class that you perpetually fail https://t.co/4re2TT7LHA\u2014 J. Escobedo Shepherd (@jawnita) May 25, 2017\n\n\n\nAnyway, after Spotify selected the 15 songs most likely to burrow their way into your skull through August, it labeled each with the summer situation that it is perfect for \u2014 with the mildly funny exception of two songs by Future and Lil Uzi Vert, which are labeled only with the information that they are rap songs. Noted! \n\nThe \u201cThis Song is [two fire emoji]\u2019 Song\u201d: \u201cBad Liar\u201d by Selena Gomez \nThe Party Song: \u201cStrip That Down\u201d by Liam Payne feat. Quavo  \nThe Lounging by the Pool Song: \u201cI\u2019m The One\u201d by DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne (Also a recent One Video selection on The Verge!) \nThe My Summer Fling is a Disaster Song: \u201cCrying in The Club\u201d by Camila Cabello\nThe Sunburn Recovery Song: \u201cThe Cure\u201d by Lady Gaga\nThe Road Trip Staple: \u201cThere\u2019s Nothing Holdin\u2019 Me Back\u201d by Shawn Mendes\nUltimate Club Banger: \u201cSwish Swish\u201d by Katy Perry feat. Nicki Minaj\nThe Rap Cut: \u201cMask Off\u201d by Future\nThe Dark and Stormy: \u201cThunder\u201d by Imagine Dragons\nThe Summer Workout: \u201cDNA\u201d by Kendrick Lamar\nThe Summer Lazing Song: \u201cSlow Hands\u201d by Niall Horan\nThe Globetrotter: \u201cDespacito\u201d (Remix) by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee feat. Justin Bieber\nThe Cruising to the Beach Song: \u201cMalibu\u201d by Miley Cyrus\nThe Song with an Important Message: \u201c1-800-273-8255\u201d by Logic feat. Alessia Cara, Khalid\nThe Best Trap Option: \u201cXO TOUR Llif3\u201d by Lil Uzi Vert\n\nBut here\u2019s what most of these songs are actually perfect for: being bummed out. Or, to borrow a phrase, crying in the club. Liam Payne\u2019s debut song as a solo artist is one of the worst things I have ever heard in my life, and that is coming from someone who tried to believe in him even after he compared himself to Tyga. Working through the list, I doubt we (as a species) are capable of fathoming Niall Horan, a perfect angel of love and light and intellectual curiosity, at all, or ever will be. As such, his post-One Direction solo music will only ever hurt us a little, like sipping pure grain alcohol or staring into the sun.\ni\u2019m sad\n\u201cMalibu\u201d strikes me as a song written and performed under coercion, and I don\u2019t really want to talk about how bad Shawn Mendes is because the last time I did that I received upwards of 500 death threats on the internet. Any song featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid, the idols of a brand-new generation of teens that I am not a part of and can\u2019t completely relate to, is only going to make me feel like I am nearing death. \nIn summer, we need to party while we can... while Congress is in recess. We deserve a better \u201cclub banger\u201d than a track with Katy Perry on it, weakly dissing another pop star who also doesn\u2019t belong in the club, and we deserve to forget that Imagine Dragons is a thing, which I mostly had until right now. We deserve true apocalypse pop or its polar opposite \u2014 the brain-pickling earnest romanticism of Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s latest offering \u2014 and nothing in between. If we deserve anything from Kendrick Lamar\u2019s DAMN. it\u2019s \u201cFEAR\u201d or \u201cLOVE,\u201d and oh my god, what is wrong with everyone who is letting Lana Del Rey\u2019s two perfect summer singles sit in the corner gathering dust? This is no fault of Spotify\u2019s, but 2017\u2019s summer pop roster could really use a few heroes. \n\n\n(\u201cBad Liar\u201d is incredible. If the list had stopped there it would have been a great list.)\nThe best summer song is the one that gets pumped, whether you like it or not, out of every car window in the United States for three entire months. Spotify, to its credit, does not dare to guess which song that might be. We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\nThree weeks until summer, please hold on!\n"}
