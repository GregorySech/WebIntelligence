{"title": "The Mars 2030 VR experience takes all the stakes out of a Mars mission", "content": " \nI\u2019m standing on a high peak, surrounded by red Martian rocks, when the sand storm approaches. I see it in the distance. It bubbles up in the atmosphere, its menacing clouds coming closer and closer. When the red wind finally hits, it\u2019s underwhelming. There aren\u2019t any gusts against my body, no flecks of dirt against my helmet, no adrenaline running through my veins. All I can feel is the queasiness that comes with spending a half-hour using a VR headset. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Mars 2030, a VR experience of the Red Planet produced by Fusion Media Group in partnership with NASA and MIT\u2019s AeroAstro Lab. (Fusion Media Group is a competitor of Vox Media, The Verge's parent company.) Mars 2030 allows you to wander around 15 square miles of Martian landscape. You can plant a flag, pick up some rocks, drive a rover, visit a habitat, and do pretty much nothing else. However, there\u2019s no game, no task for you to accomplish (other than analyzing rocks for traces of life), and no life-threatening situations. You can\u2019t even die. Overall, it\u2019s very much unlike what a mission to the Red Planet would probably be like.\nJust traveling across 34 million miles of deep space to get to Mars would be a huge challenge: zero gravity and space radiation would likely ravage your body and mess with your mind. Even if you get there in one piece, there won\u2019t be much lallygagging around outside; you\u2019d be spending every single minute of your life trying to not die. The atmosphere is unbreathable, there\u2019s no liquid water, and the average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The gravity is also a third of what\u2019s on Earth, and it\u2019s not clear what would happen to your sack of skin, blood, and bones once you\u2019re there. (And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the problems of growing food \u2014 mainly that the soil might be toxic.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Fusion Media Group\n\n\n\nThe Mars 2030 VR experience assumes all this has been figured out already, which is a mistake. After all, trying to figure out how to survive on Mars is narratively rich and compelling. When you arrive, you have to figure out how to remove perchlorates from the soil, set up a functioning habitat and its solar panels, or build a robot to mine Mars for water, for instance \u2014 or you die. Having a storyline doesn\u2019t make something less educational. Just ask any US student who learned what dysentery was from the early video game The Oregon Trail.\nThe VR \u201cexperience\u201d just shows you that there\u2019s already a habitat powered by solar panels and a greenhouse where potatoes and broccoli are growing underneath purplish-pink LED lights. The toilet looks very futuristic, with what looks like a suction system and two levers on each side. I try to pull the lever, just to hear a toilet flush in VR, but it doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s also a humanoid robot called Valkyrie that\u2019s supposed to assist with tasks like mining the Martian soil for water. I encounter Valkyrie once: creepily marching in place as if it\u2019s glitching.\nAfter visiting the habitat, I teletransport to a cavern that was once a lava tube. (There\u2019s also the option of \u201cwalking,\u201d but it was so nausea-inducing that the creators decided to add a teletransport button.) The cavern is long and convoluted. It\u2019d look like a cave here on Earth if it weren\u2019t for the dusty, red rocks. I pick one up and suddenly I\u2019m shown a scene from billions years ago, when volcanoes were spewing huge streams of lava on the surface Mars. Another rock I pick up later shows me a different scene on Mars, complete with a giant lake and floating icebergs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VR experience is meant to show what strolling around Mars will be like in 2030, around the time NASA plans to get there. The spaceship, habitat, and space suits are all based on NASA\u2019s concepts, with \u201cthe highest regard for scientific accuracy,\u201d the project leader Julian Beyes tells me. But you won\u2019t be able to feel like you\u2019re on the Red Planet: you\u2019re just sitting on a chair holding two joysticks, looking at a computerized version of a Martian landscape that looks more stunning on an actual 2D photograph. For an \u201cimmersive\u201d VR experience, it\u2019s pretty boring. (I was invited to test a near-finished preview of the experience, which has since been updated for a \u201cbetter build.\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Fusion Media Group\n\n\nThere was only one moment in the VR experience that felt real to me: I was outside the lava tube, at night, alone in this alien expanse. The night sky was filled with brilliant stars, just like it would be here on Earth. For a second, I really did feel like an astronaut on another planet. If humans walk on Mars, perhaps they, too, will marvel at the weird familiarity of seeing the Milky Way from an alien world. \nThen, they\u2019ll go back to worrying about staying alive.\nMars 2030 is available for $14.99 today on Steam for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. It\u2019s coming out on PlayStation VR next year. The download is free for teachers and students. \n\n"}
