{"title": "Capcom\u2019s Monster Hunter World is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC", "content": " \nCapcom is bringing a brand new game in its huge-in-Japan Monster Hunter series to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Monster Hunter World is coming out in early 2018, and while we don\u2019t know too much about it we can say it\u2019s by far the most visually impressive Monster Hunter game yet. All other games in the series have been designed around the technical limitations of systems like the PS2, Wii, and 3DS, so the leap to modern hardware marks a huge upgrade.\nCapcom is also bringing Monster Hunter XX to Nintendo Switch later this year, making Monster Hunter World somewhat of a surprise. The new game appears to play very differently to others, however, with a more fluid and open approach to hunting. It\u2019s possible that Capcom will keep the traditional games on Switch to make use of local co-op while developing World for more powerful home systems.\n"}
