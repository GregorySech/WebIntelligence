{"title": "Radiohead\u2019s saddest song is True Love Waits, according to data analysis", "content": " \nIf you\u2019ve ever listened to Radiohead and thought to yourself, \u201cOh jeez, I do wish someone could quantify just how sad this song is making me feel,\u201d your strange desire has been granted. Data scientist Charlie Thompson recently used the programming language R to find \u201ca data-driven determination of [Radiohead\u2019s] most depressing song.\u201d\nFirst, Thompson used Spotify\u2019s API to pull track information for each song on Radiohead\u2019s nine studio albums. One of Spotify\u2019s available metrics is a song\u2019s \u201cvalence,\u201d which the company describes as \u201ca measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.\u201d Radiohead\u2019s \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d and \u201cWe Suck Young Blood\u201d both had the lowest valence score of 0.0378, making them the saddest songs according to Spotify.\nBut Thompson also factored in lyrics. He determined which words qualified as \u201csad\u201d using a crowdsourced project about word association from Canada\u2019s National Research Council, then scraped Radiohead lyrics from the Genius API. He then mined each track for sad words, and determined what percentage of a song\u2019s lyrics were sad. In lyrical terms only, \u201cHigh and Dry\u201d was the saddest song at 36 percent. \nBut Thompson also needed to determine how important words were in each track, so in his final algorithm, he weighed the sad word count by lyrical density. Thompson\u2019s Gloom Index equation averaged the valence of a track and its sad word percentage. It looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Thompson\n\n\nThe results were scaled to fit within 1 to 100. \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d won the designation of saddest song with a Gloom Index score of 1. The jumpy In Rainbows track \u201c15 Step\u201d earned the highest score of 100. Thompson dives deep into his process here.\nAfter each song was scored, Thompson made an interactive chart that compares each album, which you can check out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here it is, Radiohead\u2019s saddest song ever (video by Finn Callan):\n\nCan someone do this with Bright Eyes next?\n"}
