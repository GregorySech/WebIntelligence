{"title": "You can now purchase the beautiful maps from Lev Grossman\u2019s Magicians trilogy", "content": " \nI\u2019m a huge fan of Lev Grossman\u2019s Magicians novels, which are the basis for the Syfy show by the same name. The books are fantastic, and each installment \u2014 The Magicians, The Magician King, and The Magicians\u2019s Land \u2014 came with a beautiful map that detail some of the key locations in the story. For the first time, they\u2019re now being offered for sale. \nIn the first novel, a young man named Quentin Coldwater discovers that magic exists, and enrolls in a magical academy called Brakebrills. He and his friends later discover that the world of their favorite fantasy series Fillory and Further (think Chronicles of Narnia) is a real, but terrifying place. Critics have described the books as a more grown-up version of Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia, and Grossman uses them to put a more adult, nuanced spin on how a magical academy and world might exist.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArt: Roland Chambers\n\n\nLike any good fantasy series, the books come with maps. Illustrated by Roland Chambers, they depict the magical world of Fillory from The Magicians, the Voyage of the Muntjac from The Magician King, and the map depicting the various worlds visited by Quentin in the trilogy in The Magician\u2019s Land. Chambers is offering high-quality copies of the maps for sale for the first time.\nChambers will only produce 100 copies of each map, and they\u2019ll be printed on high quality Canson Aquarelle Rag sized A2 (16.53 x 23.39 inches) paper. These won\u2019t be cheap: each signed map will go for \u00a3100 (shipping is included.) That\u2019s a bit steep, but for fans of the books and TV show, it\u2019ll be a neat keepsake to hang on your wall. Chambers is taking preorders through January 1st, 2018, and will begin shipping shortly thereafter. \n"}
