{"title": "YouTube tightens rules around videos with external links", "content": " \nYouTube is adding new requirements for users who link out to crowdfunding campaigns or other external sites in their videos. Users must now join the YouTube Partner Program in order to add end cards with external links \u2014 a common way for YouTubers to point fans toward merchandise or Patreon pages. This limits the cards to channels with 10,000 total public views or more, once YouTube has approved them for the program.\nA YouTube spokesperson says this is supposed to curb abuse of the cards by letting the platform individually evaluate channels before allowing them. Like many YouTube policy tweaks, the change has caused confusion among users, several of whom believed YouTube was intentionally blocking links to Patreon campaigns. The spokesperson, however, says that this change isn\u2019t targeting any specific site.\n\n\nConfirmed. This is bullshit. pic.twitter.com/Kh428fWiWO\u2014 Ian Danskin (@InnuendoStudios) September 28, 2017\n\n\n\nYouTube\u2019s interface now tells users to enable their channel for monetization if they want to add links, which has further muddied the waters. \u201cEnabling monetization\u201d essentially means applying to the Partnership Program, but users took it to mean that YouTube only allowed end cards on videos where it was running ads. The spokesperson says this isn\u2019t the case, and that Partnership Program members can use the cards even if they never monetize any videos. In theory, this means users don\u2019t have to worry about losing cards on videos that YouTube has demonetized for controversial content. Either way, the change doesn\u2019t stop people from putting links in video descriptions; you just can\u2019t put them front and center on people\u2019s screens without approval.\nThis change essentially expands a restriction that YouTube placed on advertising earlier this year, when it only let people monetize videos once they\u2019d hit 10,000 views. That shift was supposed to stop people from reaping rewards from sketchy channels that uploaded copyrighted material or ripped off content from other YouTubers. But the site doesn\u2019t seem to have communicated this new rule very well, so it isn\u2019t surprising that creators were worried, given the already tumultuous relationship YouTube has with its users.\nHere\u2019s the full YouTube statement:\nIn order to use externally-linking end cards in videos, creators are being asked to join the YouTube Partner program, so that we can evaluate the validity of the channel, as well as  determine whether the channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. This update is meant to curb abuse and does not affect current YouTube partners or existing end cards. Additionally channels do not have to actually monetize any videos as part of this requirement.\n\n"}
