{"title": "Grammys 2017: how to watch music\u2019s biggest award show online", "content": " \nThe 59th annual Grammy Awards will feature the first significant changes made to the ceremony in some time. After hosting the show for five consecutive years, LL Cool J has been replaced by Carpool Karaoke specialist James Corden, in an attempt to breathe new life into the program. While that may be the most notable public-facing change to the show, the most important shift comes in how the people running the Grammys determined award eligibility this year.\nFor the first time, the Grammys have allowed free albums and mixtapes released on streaming services to be included in the voting process, opening up a new avenue for artists like Chance the Rapper to be recognized for their work. The Chicago artist, who released his latest mixtape Coloring Book exclusively through Apple Music back in May, earned seven nominations this year, and will perform during the event.\nThe Grammy Awards will air live from 8PM ET to 11:30PM ET on CBS\nThe rule changes also point to the growing stature that streaming services have obtained in the music industry. Apple and Spotify have solidified themselves as the future of the business, and the biggest award show, despite its sluggish pace at times, is adapting to keep up.\nWith performances from Adele, Bruno Mars, The Weeknd, Daft Punk, and Beyonc\u00e9, there will be plenty to talk about for the next few days. The Grammy Awards will air live tonight from 8PM ET to 11:30PM ET on CBS, and will be streamed online through CBS All Access, which requires a subscription that starts at $5.99 a month. Luckily if you haven\u2019t tried the service before, you can sign up for a one-week trial that will allow you to watch the Grammys for free.\nSmartphones and tablets\nYou can download the free CBS app from the iOS App Store, the Google Play Store, or Microsoft's Windows 10 Store and stream the event after you log in or sign up for CBS All Access. If you\u2019re trying to watch The Grammys on BlackBerry or Palm device, welcome to 2017, you\u2019re out of luck, and can I borrow your time machine?\nGame consoles, set-top boxes, and smart TVs\nCBS All Access is available on the biggest set-top boxes and game consoles, but it\u2019ll be impossible to find if you only have a smart TV at your disposal. The app is available on the Apple TV, Android TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, PS4, Roku, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Once you sign in to your CBS All Access account, you can stream the award show. If you\u2019re trying to access CBS through a smart TV, you\u2019ll be out of luck, so plan accordingly. \nPC or Mac\nIf you don\u2019t live in one of the 153 markets that CBS can stream live TV online in, you may be out of luck if your only avenue to use CBS All Access is on a PC or Mac. Signing in to CBS All Access on a browser will give you a more restrictive version of the service, but for most people who live in cities (even towns as small as Bangor, ME and Tyler, TX) you should have access to a live stream of the Grammys. \n\nBeyonc\u00e9 performs at the Grammys\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
