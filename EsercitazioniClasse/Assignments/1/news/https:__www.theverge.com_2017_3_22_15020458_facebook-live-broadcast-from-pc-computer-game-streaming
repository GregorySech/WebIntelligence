Users will be able to simply broadcast straight from a built-in webcam. More advanced streamers can use external camera hardware or streaming software to make high-quality broadcasts with multiple cameras, on-screen graphics, and title cards. \nBy opening up computer-based streaming to everyone, it\u2019s clear that Facebook is hoping to take live videos more seriously by making it possible for all its users to create more professional and robust broadcasts. \nEvery single Facebook account just became a Twitch account\nAnd on the gaming side of things, Facebook just became another outlet for gamers looking to attract a streaming audience. In other words, every single Facebook account just became a Twitch account with a massive potential audience already subscribed to your channel. \nLive video options will be built directly into Facebook\u2019s News Feed and user profiles, making it as easy to start a broadcast as it is to post a status. Desktop broadcasts will appear in your friends\u2019 News Feeds exactly like mobile broadcasts do now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
