{"title": "Watch Roborace\u2019s self-driving racecar do a full-speed lap", "content": " \nRoborace is an effort to create a completely autonomous racing competition, one that will supposedly run alongside all-electric racing series Formula E. That\u2019s an extremely ambitious challenge, but the company recently ticked off an important milestone: the development version of the car did a full-speed lap of the Formula E track in Berlin, Germany.\nOver the last year and a half that we\u2019ve known about Roborace, the company has been documenting the incremental progress being made in a highly polished docu-style videos. They\u2019re are always a fun little window into where the company\u2019s at in creating this self-driving series, but they\u2019re also often light on video of the cars driving themselves. This video above is a nice break from that. In it, we get to see a full lap of the Berlin circuit from a camera placed inside the car\u2019s cockpit. \nThe car\u2019s lap was about 30 seconds slower than the ones from the Formula E drivers \nThe development car \u2014 which has crashed on tracks like this in the past \u2014 completes the lap in about 1 minute and 40 seconds. That\u2019s less than 30 seconds off the pace that the Formula E drivers set during their race, which is pretty impressive. It handled the sharp turns deftly, if a bit slowly, and was definitely much easier on the brakes than its human counterparts.  \nThe car reached a top speed of about 124 miles per hour, according to another video released by Roborace. That\u2019s still shy of the 170-mile-per-hour mark set by the NIO EP9, which recently lapped the Circuit of the Americas in self-driving mode, or even the 149-mile-per-hour speed set by an autonomous Audi RS7 in 2015. (To be fair, though, both of those attempts were on full-sized race circuits, not a cramped street layout.) \nThe next step for Roborace is to get the outrageous final production racecar up to speed. So far, that version has only puttered around one real street circuit. \n"}
