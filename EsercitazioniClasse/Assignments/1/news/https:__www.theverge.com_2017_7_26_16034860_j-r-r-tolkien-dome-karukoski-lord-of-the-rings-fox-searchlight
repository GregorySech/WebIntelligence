{"title": "Another biopic about J.R.R. Tolkien will focus on his formative years before WWI", "content": " \nEver since Peter Jackson\u2019s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies blew up at the box office, there\u2019s been a desire to replicate that success by adapting more from Tolkien, including his own life story. Deadline reports that Finnish director Dome Karukoski (Tom of Finland) has signed on to direct Tolkien, which will focus on the titular author \u201cas he finds friendship, love, and artistic inspiration among a fellow group of outcasts at school prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\u201d \nNicholas Hoult (X-Men: First Class, Mad Max: Fury Road) is the frontrunner to portray the iconic fantasy author, who was born in South Africa and fought in the First World War prior to writing the fantasy novels that he\u2019s become famous for.\nThis is the second film about Tolkien in the works\nThis isn\u2019t the only biopic about Tolkien in the works. Back in November, word broke that New Line Cinema was putting together a film called Middle Earth, to be helmed by director James Strong (Broadchurch, Downton Abbey). The film will follow Tolkien\u2019s courtship with Edith Bratt, who would later become his wife, and the inspiration for one of his first Middle-earth stories.  \nIt looks as though Karukoski\u2019s film won\u2019t tread over the exact same ground as Strong\u2019s film, instead focusing on Tolkien and a group of friends (Robert Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, Tolkien, and Christopher Wiseman) who called themselves the Tea Club and Barrovian Society (TCBS). The four were particularly close; they attended school together and shared one another\u2019s writings for critiquing. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, they each joined the military and fought on the front lines. \nThis is where the story is tragic: Gilson and Smith were killed during the war, events that profoundly impacted Tolkien, who later said that the war \u201chad come down like winter on his creative powers in their first bloom.\u201d \nThe author incorporated some of his experiences into The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, utilizing the brutal imagery of warfare in his books, and channeling the great sense of loss that was felt in Europe after the war.\n"}
