{"title": "This solar system of seven Earth-sized planets may be the best place to look for alien life", "content": " \nAround 40 light-years away, seven Earth-sized planets have been spotted orbiting closely around a small, ultra-cool star. It\u2019s one of the largest solar systems that\u2019s ever been discovered outside of our own, and it\u2019s a particularly enticing find in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life. Six of the planets in the system may have the right temperatures for liquid water to exist on their surfaces, and astronomers are confident they\u2019ll be able to get a more in-depth look at these seven worlds with future space telescopes.\nA particularly enticing find in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life\nThe solar system, detailed today in a study in Nature, isn\u2019t a completely new find. In fact, the discovery of this system was announced last year by the same researchers. But at the time, they thought they had only found three planets around the star, named TRAPPIST-1. When the researchers took a closer look at the system with more precise telescopes, including NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space Telescope, they found more planets nearby.\n\u201cWe got plenty of new data, and we went from three to four to five planets,\u201d Micha\u00ebl Gillon, a research associate for the Belgian Funds for Scientific Research and lead author of the Nature study, tells The Verge. \u201cThen we got this Spitzer data that showed there were, in fact, seven planets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rendering of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\nPhoto: NASA / JPL-Caltech\n\n\nSince these planets are roughly the same size as Earth, the researchers think they may be rocky like our own world. And three orbit within the star\u2019s habitable zone, where temperatures are just right that there could be whole oceans on the planets\u2019 surfaces. Given that liquid water is such an essential ingredient for life here on our planet, astronomers are eager to find it on other worlds outside our Solar System. The presence of liquid water on an exoplanet could mean that life has thrived there as well, so that makes these seven planets now top candidates in the search for alien life.\nThe astronomers say they\u2019ll be able to study these exoplanets and their atmospheres in greater detail\nThe astronomers say there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll get some answers, since they\u2019ll be able to study these exoplanets and their atmospheres in greater detail. In the grand scheme of the Universe, 40 light-years is a relatively short distance, which makes observing this system a bit easier with our telescopes. Plus, peering into the planets\u2019 atmospheres is less challenging since these planets orbit around a star that\u2019s much smaller and fainter than our yellow Sun. If they orbited a star the size of ours, the intense starlight would make the worlds and their atmospheres difficult to see. \u201cOf course it\u2019s super exciting, but what makes the system so special is that all these seven planets are suited for detailed atmospheric characterization,\u201d says Gillon.\nThis is why small, super-cool stars \u2014 known as red dwarfs \u2014 have become popular targets for exoplanet hunters; it\u2019s easier to study the planets around them. Over the past couple of years, Gillon and his team have been focused on looking for worlds around red dwarfs using the TRAPPIST telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Less than a couple years ago, their search led them to TRAPPIST-1, a star just a little bigger than Jupiter.\n\nThey found three worlds orbiting TRAPPIST-1 by watching the planets as they passed in front of the star \u2014 a process known as transiting. Whenever a planet transits in front of its host star, it slightly dims the star\u2019s light. That dimming is incredibly small, but with the right instruments, astronomers can sometimes pick up these minute light changes from Earth. Through this process, astronomers can use the dimming to calculate the size, mass, and orbit of a passing planet.\nThe astronomers decided to keep observing the system and have spent more than 1,000 hours spying on the star and its planets with other telescopes. The new data has helped bring the rest of the planets into view, with NASA\u2019s Spitzer Telescope revealing two planets that could not have been seen from telescopes on the ground. (The telescope\u2019s location in space allows it to bypass Earth\u2019s noisy atmosphere and gather more precise data.) The follow-up observations also revealed that some of the scientists\u2019 original findings had been misinterpreted. One of the original three planets the team had identified turned out to be multiple planets.\nThe planets all orbit closer to TRAPPIST-1 than Mercury orbits the Sun\nThe planets, which have been named alphabetically from b to h, all orbit closer to TRAPPIST-1 than Mercury orbits the Sun. The closest planet takes just 1.5 Earth days to complete one orbit, while the farthest planet takes around 20 days to circle the star. Because of this, they\u2019re all a super tight bunch. When TRAPPIST-1f and TRAPPIST-1g are at their closest to one another, they\u2019re just at three times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. So if you were to stand on TRAPPIST-1f, sometimes TRAPPIST-1g would look twice as big as the Moon in the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that you could see another world right there,\u201d Amaury Triaud, an exoplanet fellow at the Kavli Institute at the University of Cambridge and a study author, tells The Verge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe properties of the TRAPPIST-1 planets compared to the four innermost planets in our Solar System.\nPhoto: NASA / JPL-Caltech\n\n\nAnd in a beautiful coincidence, the inner six planets seem to orbit somewhat in sync \u2014 a phenomenon known as orbital resonance. For instance, when TRAPPIST-1g completes four orbits around the star, TRAPPIST-1f completes three orbits \u2014 a ratio of 4:3. It\u2019s an interesting trait that will help astronomers better understand how the system came to be. \u201cThey\u2019re all synchronized, and it\u2019s telling us about how they formed,\u201d says Triaud. \u201cIt\u2019s a clue about past formation, so it\u2019s both beautiful and handy.\u201d\nThe biggest draw of this system is its promise for habitability\nBut the biggest draw of this system is its promise for habitability. Sure, the star\u2019s close proximity to its planets means these worlds receive substantially more radiation than Earth does. But Triaud maintains TRAPPIST-1 is a fairly quiet red dwarf, meaning it doesn\u2019t send out solar flares very often. Plus, six of the planets could have surface temperatures that range between 32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit, which may allow liquid water to exist; some could have water on a fraction of their surfaces, while the most enticing three \u2014 e, f, and g \u2014 may be covered in the stuff.\nTo figure this out, astronomers will try to detect the components of each planet\u2019s atmosphere. One way to do that is to look at the star\u2019s light as it passes through the gas circulating around the planet. Different gases will filter the light in different ways, giving astronomers a good idea of what compounds surround each world. Additionally, astronomers can measure the drop in brightness of the system when a planet passes behind the star. It\u2019s a negative measurement that can be used to figure out the light that\u2019s coming off of each planet, which can also be used to deduce what\u2019s in the worlds\u2019 atmospheres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn artist rendering of what it might look like from the surface of TRAPPIST-1f.\nPhoto: NASA / JPL-Caltech\n\n\nIf there is an abundant amount of H20 in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, then chances are there is liquid water on the surface below. \u201cIf we see water vapor in the atmosphere, we\u2019re going to be very excited,\u201d Sara Seager, an exoplanet expert at MIT, tells The Verge. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t prove 100 percent, but we\u2019d be pretty sure that there\u2019s liquid water on the planet.\u201d So far, liquid water has never been found on an exoplanet. The next step after that is to look for other gases that don\u2019t belong in the atmosphere \u2014 especially ones that could be coming from biological life. \u201cOur favorite one is oxygen,\u201d says Seager. \u201cWithout life on Earth, we wouldn\u2019t have oxygen at all. So we\u2019ll go down our list of things we\u2019re looking for, kind of like a triage.\u201d\n\u201cIf we see water vapor in the atmosphere, we\u2019re going to be very excited. We couldn\u2019t prove 100 percent, but we\u2019d be pretty sure that there\u2019s liquid water on the planet.\u201d\nTo get these tantalizing answers, the astronomers hope to use NASA\u2019s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When it launches, JWST will sit at more than 1 million miles from Earth and will observe the Universe in the infrared. It\u2019s a type of light that can\u2019t be seen but can be felt as heat. Observing star systems in the infrared makes it much easier to pinpoint when light is coming from a star and when it\u2019s being reflected off of a planet. Plus, JWST will be the most powerful space telescope ever built, seeing cosmic objects with more precision than ever before.\nHowever, JWST doesn\u2019t launch until 2018. In the meantime, Gillon and his team will be using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope to keep looking at their seven-planet system. \u201cMaybe it will tell us something about the frequency of life and habitable conditions in the Universe,\u201d says Gillon. \u201cThis system is really a cornerstone in exoplanetology.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the James Webb Telescope\n\n\n\n\n"}
