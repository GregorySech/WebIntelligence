{"content": " Every week, a slew of new music videos hits the web. Watching them at your desk is not time theft because you deserve it; think of it as a nice reward for surviving another work week. But what if you don\u2019t have time to watch every video \u2014 maybe you have a deadline, a hungry pet, or other grown-up concerns. In consideration of your schedule, Lizzie and Kaitlyn bring you a series called One Video. Each week we\u2019ll tell you \u201cone video\u201d you need to watch, why, and for how long.This week\u2019s video: \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot\u201d by Big ShaqLizzie: Wow, what a week. And by that I mean, \u201cOh my God, here with are with another installment of One Video.\u201d Time just keeps going! Speaking of time, the winner this week basically just ran out the clock until the One Video team was like, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve gotta pick something, and Kendrick Lamar isn\u2019t doing us any favors today.\u201d That\u2019s how we got here, with \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot.\u201dKaitlyn: It\u2019s true. In a groggy early morning Instagram scroll, I erroneously assumed that SZA\u2019s post about hanging out with Kendrick Lamar in the desert meant that there would be a \u201cDoves in the Wind\u201d video to watch today, but, like so many things that seem possible after the sun comes up but before the inbox hits \u2014 it was only a dream. We were also forced to consider a Photoshop tutorial from the dudes of Spoon, an extremely expensive still-life painting of Taylor Swift re-enacting the Evil Kermit meme in a space assassin costume, and a violin solo by a ghost. In the end, we settled on \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot\u201d because it had the best storyline: it\u2019s about a man who\u2019s not hot, even when wearing full arctic outerwear inside a glamorous Friendly\u2019s and even when wearing socks, sandals, and sweatpants on a Miami beach. He should be studied by scientists! Who is Big Shaq?Lizzie: Big Shaq, aka Roadman Shaq, is a character created by the British comedian Michael Dapaah. Last month, his freestyle on BBC Radio 1Xtra went viral because of lines like \u201cTwo plus two is four, minus one that's three, quick maths\u201d and a long, sloppy gunshot onomatopeia.i cant believe i have 280 characters... what do i do with this power. theres still so much space left. what do i even say. i dont think in such long sentences normally. are people still even reading? this is ridiculous but exciting at the same time. send help. THE TING GO SKRRR P\u2014 min    EXAMS   @Ioveskang  September 27, 2017Kaitlyn: This is a very flexible meme, and was used to make light fun of Instagram star Rupi Kaur\u2019s debut poetry collection Milk and Honey, multiple choice exam questions, and Adele. My suspicion is that Dapaah\u2019s catchphrase-riddled tune was inspired in part by a musical number from one of the best comedies of 2016, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. In it, Andy Samberg\u2019s character records a rap verse called \u201cThe Catchphrase Verse,\u201d and it goes like this: \u201cIt's Conner, bitch / Say word / D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dilbert / Doink-de-doink, sorry dad/ Dinky nuts, squirrel jam, HATS! / Balancing my checkbook / Zerbert in the sherbet, squark / One hundred gift baskets / You're now rocking with the Tesla boys / Sleepy Benjamin Franklin, watch me veg / DJ Tanner, swanky pumps, m-m-m-m-moped music / Costco samples like a motherfucker / Uh, crank up the mids, Patrick Stewart money / You know who it is, Conner4Real.\u201dWow! Please wait until you\u2019re done reading this article before you run off to create your own Popstar-inspired art. What\u2019s special about \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot?\u201dLizzie: The video for \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot\u201d has more than 4 million views, and Big Shaq isn\u2019t even a real person. Dapaah, however, is a real person, and he\u2019s milking the power of the internet\u2019s meme-makers for all its worth before we collectively decide to move on. In keeping with the song\u2019s theme  man\u2019s not hot , Big Shaq keeps his winter jacket on for the entire video: while at the beach, eating elaborate ice cream sundaes, and doing pull-ups.Dapaah even managed to convince DJ Khaled, who has now staked his entire career on his ability to remain a meme, to be in the video. They take a selfie together.Kaitlyn: DJ Khaled tells Big Shaq, \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to win so we\u2019re gonna win more.\u201d It\u2019s one of his better catchphrases. I hope it\u2019s true. Lil Yachty is also briefly in the video for \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot,\u201d presumably to support a fellow internet success story. What\u2019s special about the video, overall, is the idea that any person can make themselves famous based on any element of their personality. This guy got famous for wearing jackets a lot and being okay at simple arithmetic. What could you become famous for? Drinking coffee? Combing your hair? Putting peanut butter on one piece of bread and then jelly on another? Tweeting complaints about the subway at New York governor Andrew Cuomo? It\u2019s all possible.  How long everyone should watch \u201cMan\u2019s Not Hot\u201d by Big Shaq:Lizzie: You don\u2019t need to watch the entire thing. I think if you watch from 2:20 to 3:00 you\u2019ll get a pretty good sense of things and maybe be able to walk away without the phrase \u201cBabes, man\u2019s not hot\u201d stuck in your head. At this point, that\u2019s all we can hope for.Kaitlyn: Additionally, you should watch the part at 1:24 where Big Shaq says \u201cmy man\u2019s got a frisbee.\u201d To back up his claim, the man he is referring to goes ahead and throws a frisbee into the sky. How many friends do you have who carry around props for the sole purpose of affirming all of your statements? Not enough, I would guess.
