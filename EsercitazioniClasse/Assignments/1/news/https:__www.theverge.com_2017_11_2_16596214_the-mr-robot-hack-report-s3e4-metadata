{"title": "The Mr. Robot Hack Report: Don\u2019t Fear the Rabbler", "content": " \nMr. Robot is back, and the C Y B E R is back, too. The show takes a special interest in showing off the details that usually get glossed over, often drawing on real hacks and real cybersecurity problems. So after every episode, I\u2019ll be breaking down who got hacked, how, and with what. It turns out, there\u2019s a lot more to each one than you can see on-screen.\nThis week was huge for Darlene, as she managed to talk her way out of a tight bind with Elliot and track Mr. Robot back to Tyrell\u2019s secret hacking cave. Stage Two seems troubled, but still basically viable? Both Angela and Darlene came extremely close to getting exposed \u2014 Darlene for her FBI connect, and Angela for her Dark Army gig \u2014 but both were able to get through unscathed, at least for now.\nAt the same time, we\u2019re starting to dive back into hacks after last week\u2019s journey into the twitchy soul of Tyrell. So let\u2019s take a look at what happened, starting with Elliot\u2019s anti-bugging box.\nRABBLE ME THIS\nWhen Elliot talks to Darlene at the beginning of the episode, he puts a tiny noise box on the mantle to make sure no one can listen in. \u201cThe audio\u2019s useless,\u201d Dom\u2019s partner tells her over the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s using a goddamn voice protector!\u201d We\u2019ve seen this thing in a couple of earlier episodes, and it always has the same effect, blocking any sound that would be picked up by the FBI bugs. So what is it?\nThere are a bunch of sound-masking systems like this on the market, but the one Elliot\u2019s using looks an awful lot like a Rabbler. It\u2019s basically a speaker with a pre-recorded sound loop, but the loop itself is pretty interesting. The company compiled a bunch of overlapping snippets of different voices, as if dozens of people were quietly speaking just out of hearing range. As a result, it\u2019s extremely hard for anyone listening in to pick out which sounds are coming from the rabbler and which sounds are coming from the people they\u2019re trying to bug. The trick is placing it close enough to the bug that your voice is drowned out, which is hard because you don\u2019t know where the bug is. Still, we played with one on the aftershow, and it does seem to work. They\u2019re pretty cool!\nIt\u2019s also interesting the way Mr. Robot drops it in. Elliot doesn\u2019t have many recurring hacking tricks, but this has become one of his most persistent ones, suggesting he\u2019s carrying around the voice protector on a regular basis. Which makes sense! F-Society was an FBI target long before Darlene flipped, and by the time of this week\u2019s episode, Elliot knows something\u2019s up. \nYOU\u2019VE BEEN BACKTRACED\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news for Dom this week; she was also able to track down and raid the person who posted one of the recent F Society videos. In fact, it was so easy that she gets grouchy and suspicious after they\u2019ve brought the guy in. Here\u2019s how Dom explains it:\nWe know you posted the F Society video \u2014 with a court order, we got the Vimeo connection logs for the account you used, which led us to your IP address and then your home address. That\u2019s why you\u2019re sitting here.\nThis is a really common way to find someone after they\u2019ve done something illegal on the internet! Cops do it all the time, and you can even do it as a regular person in civil court if you think a commenter has said something defamatory, although it\u2019s really expensive and probably not a great use of your time.\nThe basic principle is that when you visit any internet service, the service see your IP address (basically the string of numbers associated with your connection to the internet). That doesn\u2019t identify you personally, but it identifies the company that set up your connection (probably your cable provider), which can then be ordered to give up your name. The result is that, if you post a terrorist video on Vimeo, it\u2019s relatively simple for courts to order Vimeo to hand over the IP address of the person who uploaded it, and then get a name from whoever that IP address belongs to.\nDom is right to be suspicious that a seasoned techno-terrorist would fall for this! There are lots of ways to make this more difficult, like using Tor, or running the requests through a botnet. If you\u2019re rad enough to be in F-Society, you must know all this stuff. And this guy didn\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t have the answers, but after running through the tech, I\u2019m every bit as grouchy as Dom.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the hack report this week! We managed to charm Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail into talking to us for next week\u2019s episode, so you\u2019ll definitely want to tune in \u2014 and as always, if you have any questions, hit us up on Reddit, or on Twitter under the hashtag #Robotaftershow.
