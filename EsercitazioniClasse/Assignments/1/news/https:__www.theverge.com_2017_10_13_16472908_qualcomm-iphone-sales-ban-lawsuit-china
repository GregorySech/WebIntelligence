{"title": "Qualcomm is trying to get iPhone sales banned in China", "content": " \nQualcomm has launched a new lawsuit against Apple, asking a Chinese court to block the sale and manufacturing of iPhones within the country, according to Bloomberg. This is the latest strike in a legal war between the two companies, which started out in the US and has since expanded worldwide.\nIn its lawsuit, Qualcomm reportedly claims that Apple is in violation of three patents, none of which are essential to any industry standards \u2014 meaning Qualcomm isn\u2019t obligated to license them. \"Apple employs technologies invented by Qualcomm without paying for them,\u201d a Qualcomm spokesperson told Bloomberg. Those patents are said to cover power management and the iPhone\u2019s Force Touch feature.\n\u201cThese patents have never been discussed and in fact were only granted in the last few months.\u201d\nIn a statement, Apple said the claims were \u201cmeritless,\u201d and that it believed the effort would fail. It suggested the effort was opportunistic, because Qualcomm hadn\u2019t brought up the patents during negotiations and had only issued them recently.\n\u201cApple believes deeply in the value of innovation, and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. In our many years of ongoing negotiations with Qualcomm, these patents have never been discussed and in fact were only granted in the last few months,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said. \u201cRegulators around the world have found Qualcomm guilty of abusing their position for years. This claim is meritless and, like their other courtroom maneuvers, we believe this latest legal effort will fail.\u201d\nThis is Qualcomm\u2019s second attempt to get a ban on iPhone sales. In July, it filed a similar claim in the US, pointing to six patents that it said Apple was in violation of.\nIt seems exceedingly unlikely that sales of any iPhones will be banned. Rather, this mostly seems to be an attempt to get back at Apple for many lawsuit it\u2019s filed against Qualcomm around the globe. It could also give Qualcomm some leverage when negotiating the outcome of those suits.\nThis legal battle kicked off in January, when Apple filed a lawsuit claiming that Qualcomm was holding payments for ransom. The filing was prompted by a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission, which claimed that Qualcomm was abusing its market position to get more money when selling its smartphone modems, since it\u2019s by far the dominant supplier. Apple proceeded to file suits making similar claims around the globe, and Qualcomm fired back in various places contending patent infringement.\nThings are not looking particularly good for Qualcomm. It\u2019s been repeatedly fined for similar behaviors, with the latest ruling coming down yesterday, when it was fined $774 million by Taiwan\u2019s Fair Trade Commission.\n"}
