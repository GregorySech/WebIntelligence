{"title": "Hitman games on hold after Square Enix drops developer IO Interactive", "content": " \nSquare Enix has announced that it\u2019s withdrawing its investment in Hitman developer IO Interactive, taking a loss of $43 million in the process, as noted by Gametsu. While this move might not mark the end of the Hitman video game series \u2014 Square Enix is reportedly negotiating with potential new investors who might pick up the studio \u2014 it definitely isn\u2019t good news for the future of the franchise.\nThe most recent game in the series was the episodically released Hitman, an experiment in releasing a major blockbuster title in smaller chunks of DLC content instead of as a single game. The seven episodes that comprised the game trickled out over the course of 2016, and while they were well received critically, the strange release schedule and proximity to other, larger titles meant that many gamers overlooked Hitman entirely.\nFor now, it seems like we\u2019ll be waiting a while to see another Hitman game, assuming a new one resurfaces at all. It also marks the third major action franchise in recent months that has been put on ice. Along with Hitman, Square Enix has reportedly paused development of the Deux Ex series following underwhelming sales of Mankind Divided. And earlier this week, Kotaku reported that BioWare is putting Mass Effect on hold following the poor reception to Mass Effect: Andromeda.\n"}
