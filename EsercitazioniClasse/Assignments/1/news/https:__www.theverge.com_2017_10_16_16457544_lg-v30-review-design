{"title": "LG V30 review: groundbreaking phone with a deal-breaking flaw", "content": " \nThe LG V30 is a phone with soul.\nAnd funk and punk. And rap and rock. And jazz and blues. This is the best-sounding smartphone that\u2019s ever been made, and it also has LG\u2019s finest industrial design to date. The V30 is distinctive, modern, and stacked with desirable features, a phone seemingly destined for inevitable stardom.\nBut the V30 is also imperfect, compromised in significant ways that don\u2019t show up on a spec sheet or a feature checklist. I like this phone, and a big part of me really wanted to love it. However, after a month with it, I am coming away with the same conclusion I usually have about LG phones.\nThe $800 V30 was better as a promise on paper than a phone in real use.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the good stuff, because there\u2019s plenty of it. From among the minimal-bezel phones that have proliferated in 2017, the LG V30 has my favorite design. It is a refinement and a streamlining of LG\u2019s G6 flagship from earlier this year, and it makes the 6-inch OLED screen on the V30 feel incredibly compact. I\u2019ve reviewed 6-inch phones in the past, such as 2013\u2019s HTC One Max, and until recently I was confident that that size signaled an unwieldy two-handed behemoth. Instead, the V30 is a perfectly sculpted smartphone that\u2019s easy, even pleasurable, to operate with one hand.\nI don\u2019t love the glass back, but there\u2019s no arguing with the efficiency and ergonomics of the V30 design\nCompared to the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus from Samsung, LG\u2019s V30 is shorter, wider, and a little thinner, and those differences add up to make LG\u2019s phone more pleasant to handle. It also helps that LG has positioned its fingerprint reader on the back of the phone in a sanely central position, unlike Samsung\u2019s off-center calamity. The V30\u2019s ergonomics are so good, in fact, that I expect most people will find it as comfortable to use as smaller devices like the Google Pixel and Galaxy S8. It certainly makes bezel-laden phones like HTC\u2019s U11 and Sony\u2019s Xperia series feel desperately unoptimized in their design. Even the freshly introduced Google Pixel 2 XL, which has the same 6-inch screen, is tangibly larger than the radically minimalist LG V30.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith glass on the front and back, the V30 joins this year\u2019s trend of flagship phones moving beyond plastic and metal to an all-glass finish. That makes for a striking look and allows for the V30\u2019s wireless charging, however I\u2019m not a huge fan of the move. Previous experience with Sony\u2019s glass-back Xperia phones has shown me how easy it is to shatter any glass surface on a phone, front or back, and the everyday scratches accumulating on my regular phone are testament to the softness of the material. LG has waterproofed the V30 to an IP68 rating, and it put the device through a battery of drop tests, but glass is still glass. It will not age handsomely like, say, full-grain leather, and the scratches it picks up will make it structurally weaker rather than giving it the gritty, lived-in feel of a pair of well-worn jeans that you might get from an aluminum phone.\nAll things considered, I\u2019m happy to crown this as LG\u2019s best industrial design so far. The bezels are superbly minimal (unlike Apple and Essential notch lovers, I appreciate the symmetry of LG\u2019s device), the ergonomic compromises are nonexistent, and the sheer amount of goodness inside this extra-thin phone almost defies logic. \nYou want specs and features? LG has you covered\nThere\u2019s no set list of must-have features for a 2017 flagship phone, but here are some of the most desired ones: waterproofing, wireless charging, high-resolution display (preferably OLED), dual-camera system, a long-lasting battery, the latest processor, and a generous serving of storage. The V30 ticks all those boxes. LG ships it with 64GB of expandable storage, a 3,300mAh battery, the Snapdragon 835 processor that\u2019s practically standard-issue at the high end of Android, and one of the most mature dual-camera systems on the market. The V30 is a spec sheet champion, just like practically every flagship phone from LG ever.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing that differentiates the V30 from its predecessor V10 and V20 devices from LG is its design refinement. The V10 was subtly the best cameraphone of its time, and the V20 was the undisputed headphone audio champion, but both were giant, clumsy things. Up until this point, the V series was defined by beastly power in a beastly body, but the V30 marks a turning point where LG truly has made its best phone its most beautiful one as well. Everything good about the predecessors, minus the obviously technological design.\nThe cherry atop the LG V30 spec cake is undeniably the phone\u2019s Hi-Fi Quad-DAC audio system. It is insanely good. I\u2019m talking \u201cangels descended from heaven and plucked harps inside my ears\u201d kind of good. It\u2019s the sort of sound that makes me extend my walks and wish for my train to be delayed, just so I could listen for a little while longer. Listening with the 1More Quad Driver earphones, I find the V30\u2019s bass so tight and pure that I just gorge on it. Everything sounds phenomenal coming out of this phone, whether it\u2019s classical orchestra music, Ramin Djawadi movie soundtracks, 2Pac\u2019s pathos-laden lyrics, or the latest electronic productions from the likes of Nightmares on Wax. The only thing I don\u2019t like are the B&O Play buds that LG bundles with the V30 in most markets: they\u2019re mediocre.\nApple and Google may be pushing the entire mobile industry toward wireless audio, but LG is proving that the headphone jack can still be a source of great delight on a smartphone. I rate the purity, faithfulness, and power of LG\u2019s V30 output right up there with dedicated music players such as the Fiio X5 and X7. Given how my favorite music player is the $1,000 Astell & Kern Kann, it\u2019s not entirely crazy to think of the V30 as a cheaper high-fidelity media player with a much more modern Android interface and a lot of other good things thrown in. It just depends on how important audio is to you and your daily life.\nThe V30\u2019s headphone audio competes with the best dedicated music players, but it\u2019s still a niche benefit\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve found that, as much as I adore the V30\u2019s sound, it just isn\u2019t that critical to my everyday activities. Bringing the V30 and a Google Pixel on my recent trip to Bulgaria, I spent a lot more time using the Pixel\u2019s superior camera than I did the V30\u2019s vastly superior audio. LG is the absolute best in one category of mobile performance, but that niche is narrow. It pains me to say it, but the V30\u2019s greatest strength is a non-essential feature \u2014 just a (very) nice to have one.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs to that all-important camera on the V30, I find it good, sometimes great, but never exceptional. LG billed the V30 as a major leap forward in imaging, what with its f/1.6 aperture and real glass lens for enhanced image clarity (on the main camera), however the actual results don\u2019t distinguish this phone from a class of very high performers near the V30\u2019s lofty price point. A head-to-head comparison I did between the LG V30 and HTC U11 ended up evenly split. Both phones had a tendency to slightly overexpose images, and LG had the sharper shot more often than HTC, but that was due to the former company\u2019s continued over-reliance on artificial sharpening. This is much more restrained than it was on the LG G6, but it still leaves pictures looking less photographic. LG\u2019s camera designers told me last month that the V30 has to do less post-processing work to improve an image simply because the new camera has better optics.\nJudging by the similarities in image output from LG and Samsung phones, I\u2019d argue there\u2019s an identifiable Korean style of mobile photography, which is defined by crisp edges and contours of objects and aggressive noise suppression in areas of consistent color. That leads to a precise, pristine, and clinical look. It might be awesome if you\u2019re filing expenses or engaging in visual note-taking, but it kills intricate detail in photos and kind of sucks for capturing memories you\u2019ll treasure for a long time. I\u2019ve been put off by the digital, inorganic appearance of many of the photos I\u2019ve captured with the LG V30, and I much prefer the HTC U11, which turns out richer, more nuanced colors. The V30\u2019s images often feel muted and conservative in their saturation and contrast.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Jaguar E-type Zero\n            \n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLG\u2019s camera produces better videos than stills\n(All photos of the Jaguar E-type Zero were shot with the LG V30)\nI give credit to LG for building out a comprehensive suite of options in its camera software. The big additions this year are cinematic video filters that were developed with the help of pro videographers. They are not bad! I especially like the Summer Blockbuster filter, which makes everything look blue-orange, just like all the action flicks clogging up your local cinema. It\u2019s one of a number of well-executed video filters that really contribute a different vibe to the stuff I film. And LG backs this up with good video performance from the V30, which has impressively steady stabilization, records crystal-clear audio, and retains a nice amount of detail. LG\u2019s gone the extra step of adding a point-zoom function: every other phone can only zoom toward the center of the screen, but with the V30 you can select any point in the frame and have the camera smoothly zoom in on it. It\u2019s the sort of cool extra feature that leaves an impression.\nMy lack of enthusiasm for LG\u2019s wide-angle second camera on the back can be intuited from the fact I\u2019m mentioning it last. Even with the newest optimizations and improvements \u2014 which include reducing the fisheye distortion effect by a third relative to the V20 \u2014 LG\u2019s dual camera just doesn\u2019t excite me. The highest-quality shots still come from the main f/1.6 camera, and I rarely find myself needing the all-encompassing field of view of the wide-angle lens. I guess you can count me in the group of people that prefer the second lens to be either monochrome, as with Huawei and the Essential Phone, or a zoomed-in telephoto as with the iPhone, OnePlus 5, Galaxy Note 8, and a bunch of others.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all the core elements of the LG V30 user experience are strong. Performance is consistently fast and fluid, and battery life is at the upper end of the spectrum for the V30\u2019s class. I can comfortably get through an intensive day\u2019s use, even while deploying the power-hungry quad-DAC audio system. Like the HTC U11, which has also impressed me in recent times, the V30 provides great peace of mind that no matter what I\u2019m doing, I won\u2019t suddenly be left with a powerless phone. Having Qi wireless charging also helps in that regard, and I\u2019ve been gleefully charging the V30 using Samsung\u2019s wireless charging pad for the Galaxy S8 (albeit at slower speeds than Samsung phones can wirelessly charge at). Interoperable standards are a beautiful thing!\nLG\u2019s Android software is alright, nothing more than that\nLG\u2019s Android build on the V30 is stable and pretty close to the default Android user experience, but that\u2019s about as much good as I can say about it. The settings menu is still unnecessarily convoluted and fragmented into tabs, I can\u2019t access the apps list with a swipe up from the bottom of the home screen (a surprisingly big annoyance compared to the Google Pixel and many other Android alternatives), and LG seriously weighs its phones down with carrier bloatware. The Korean version of the V30 that I tested came with no fewer than 54 preloaded carrier apps, and the US alternatives are no better. $800 and a ton of crap I have to disable and remove? What is this, a Windows laptop from 2007?\nA cautionary note on the LG software front: the company has indicated that its Android 8.0 Oreo update for the V30 (which ships with the older Android 7.1 Nougat on board) isn\u2019t due until the end of this year. When you think about the long-term investment for an expensive phone, it\u2019s essential to consider the likelihood of facing similar delays with future Android updates down the line. Unfortunately, LG doesn\u2019t provide the same timely update reassurance that Google\u2019s Pixel phones or more adroit rivals like Samsung do.\nLooking on the bright side, I do enjoy the always-on display that LG has implemented with the V30. It lets me glance at the time and basic notifications as well as control my music without activating the phone. And it doesn\u2019t seem to consume a meaningful amount of extra power, so I have no worries about it draining my battery.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering why I have left discussion of the LG V30\u2019s display for last. Well, that\u2019s because I wanted you to understand the essential strengths and weaknesses of this phone before I told you the ultimate deal-breaker for me. The OLED screen of the V30 is just bad. There\u2019s no dodging this issue, and there\u2019s no making excuses for it. This isn\u2019t a good display, and if your phone doesn\u2019t have a good display it might as well be a Nokia 5110.\nLG\u2019s OLED display should have been the beautiful highlight of the V30, but instead it\u2019s an ugly disappointment\nAreas of the same color on the V30 appear blotchy: when I open up a Google Keep note, I don\u2019t get a flat white canvas as I should, but instead I see streaks of gray, looking as if there\u2019s an inconsistent backlight. This being an OLED display, there\u2019s no backlight to speak of, so it\u2019s just poor brightness uniformity across those light-emitting diodes. The same unhappy effect is even more pronounced with darker grays and colors like navy blue, and it\u2019s amplified by the V30\u2019s apparent inability to render color gradations smoothly. Gradients appear grainy and I see unpleasant color banding, exactly the same issues that Ars Technica encountered with a preproduction V30 device last month.\nEvery time I switched between the V30 and HTC\u2019s U11 in my testing, the U11\u2019s screen felt like a luxurious escape. It\u2019s painfully apparent that LG\u2019s so-called plastic OLED screens are multiple generations behind Samsung\u2019s alternative \u2014 which graces the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, and the upcoming iPhone X \u2014 as well as significantly behind the best LCDs, as exhibited by the U11. If you\u2019d asked me, before getting ahold of the V30, what most excited me about this phone, the bezel-deprived OLED screen would have been one of my top two or three features. I really do think LG nailed the dimensions of this phone, and I\u2019m confident the screen technology contributes to the V30\u2019s thinness (as well as making it compatible with Google\u2019s budding Daydream VR ecosystem). But the V30\u2019s desaturated, lifeless screen, addled with all of the foregoing issues, makes this a phone I find impossible to love, or even get along with on a daily basis.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike its predecessors, the LG V30 is a phone designed to appeal to spec lovers first, though with its pretty aesthetic and great ergonomics it could have stood a chance of attracting a more mainstream audience as well. But the story of LG smartphones has always been a matter of \u201ccould have\u201d and \u201cshould have.\u201d It\u2019s not that LG phones aren\u2019t improving every year \u2014 they are, and they continue to offer cutting-edge spec sheets with each new iteration \u2014 but the improvements the company is making seem to always be accompanied by self-inflicted wounds. The LG G5 was a nice step up in design over the G4, but LG hamstrung it with a poorly conceived and quickly aborted modular accessory system. The G6 got better again, but it too lacked the final polishing touch to outshine Samsung\u2019s more accomplished designs.\nThe V30 arrives half a year after the G6 and, at first blush, appears to rectify everything that ailed LG\u2019s devices of the past. But LG rushed to put an imperfect OLED screen in its flagship phone, preferring to have the highlight spec over the superior user experience, and I can\u2019t condone either the choice or the eventual product. This is a phone that has given me goosebumps with the astonishing quality of its headphone audio, and if I was reviewing it on the strength of music playback alone, I would say it\u2019s one of the best media players on the market. But this is supposed to be a smartphone. And as a smartphone, the LG V30 fails to validate its high price and flagship status.\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nVerge Score\n\n\nLG V30\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nBest headphone audio from a phone\nErgonomically excellent\nUncompromising spec sheet includes wireless charging and water resistance\nImpressive speed and battery life\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nThe display is distractingly bad\nBloatware, bloatware as far as the eye can see\nCamera doesn\u2019t produce the most lifelike images\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $810.00 from Best Buy\nBuy for $809.99 from AT&T\nBuy for $840.00 from Verizon\n\n\n\n"}
