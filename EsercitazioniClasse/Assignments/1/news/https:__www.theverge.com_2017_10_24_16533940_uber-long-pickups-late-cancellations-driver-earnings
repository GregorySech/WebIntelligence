{"title": "Uber will now charge you extra if your driver has to travel longer to reach you", "content": " \nUber is adding a bunch of new fees to sweeten the pot for drivers who may be reluctant to wait for slow passengers, drive longer distances for more out-of-the-way pickups, or get hit with trip cancellations at the last minute. That means some trips may become a little more expensive for passengers \u2014 especially those who live far away or take a little longer than usual to get in the car. \nIt\u2019s an acknowledgment that the job of driving begins long before the rider gets into the car, and that some trips, especially suburban ones, don\u2019t feel fair from an earnings perspective, said Aaron Schildkrout, head of driver product at Uber. These new surcharges are aimed \u201cprecisely at solving those pain points,\u201d he said. \ndrivers say long trips can feel like a gamble\nSome drivers have told Uber\u2019s product team that long trips \u201ccan feel like a gamble,\u201d especially if that trip only lasts a few blocks, Schildkrout said. Starting today, drivers will now earn standard time and distance rates on the way to a long pickup, in addition to the standard fare. \u201cSo if it\u2019s a 40-minute pickup, which hopefully never happens and is extremely rare, it would be some segment of 40 minutes,\u201d he said. \nUber says the decision on when those charges will kick in depends on the market and the length of the pickup. But in general, drivers will start to earn standard time and distance rates after eight or 11 minutes of driving to pick up the rider, depending on the city. One example provided by Uber was an extra charge of $5.77 for a 4.2-mile pickup that took 11.2 minutes of driving. Riders will see long pickup fees as part of their upfront fare on trips, with an estimated long pickup fee showing in the fare breakdown. In other words, Uber\u2019s algorithm will guess how long it will take your driver to get to your location, and then charge you based on that guess. \n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiders may balk at the pricier trips, but Schildkrout says it\u2019s aimed at solving a problem for them as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not always as easy to get a car in the suburbs as it is in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in the outskirts of a city people sometimes have this experience. So from a driver\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s easy to see why this makes sense: you\u2019re more likely to forgo trips with long ETAs... With this change, we hope to make those long trips more worth drivers\u2019 while. And for riders, we hope this means they\u2019ll able to get a ride reliably where ever they are.\u201d \nUber is also updating its cancellation policy to peg the fee to time and distance. Uber thinks this will advantage both riders and drivers. Riders who get matched with a driver who then refuses to move will end of paying less in cancellation fees, while drivers who travel long distances for a pickup only to get hit with a last-minute cancellation will earn more. \n\u201cso we can be more nuanced\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve updated our technology to actually detect progress by the driver toward the rider so we can be more nuanced about when to charge a rider a cancellation fee,\u201d Schildkrout said. \nRiders will also be charged extra for making drivers wait longer than two minutes. This is an extension of a pilot that started last year in New York City, New Jersey, Phoenix, and Dallas. Those fees will also vary, but in an example provided by Uber, a wait time of three minutes and 45 seconds would cost a driver $0.86 in added costs. \nThe announcement is the latest in Uber\u2019s \u201c180 days of change\u201d effort aimed at improving relations with drivers, that kicked off with the inclusion of a tipping option for drivers in the app. Other new features include allowing drivers to message riders in the app, and additional layers of feedback for bad ratings.   \n\n"}
