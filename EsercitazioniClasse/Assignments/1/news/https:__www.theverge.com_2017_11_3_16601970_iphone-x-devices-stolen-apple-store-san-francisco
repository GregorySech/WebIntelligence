{"title": "$370,000 worth of iPhone X devices were stolen from a UPS truck", "content": " Three \"husky\" men wearing hoodies broke into a UPS truck parked outside an Apple Store in San Francisco and stole over 300 iPhone X devices, with a total value of about $370,000, according to local news reports. The incident occurred between 11:15am and 11:30am PT Wednesday morning. The driver of the UPS truck had locked the vehicle after parking outside the Stonestown Galleria mall, and went to a nearby Macy's to make another delivery. During that time the thieves, who have not been caught, managed to break in and take off in a white Dodge van with all 313 of the $999+ devices.Police say they believe the thieves were tracking the truck and knew what they were looking for. \u201cGiven the dollar value in the incident itself it appears it was planned,\" said SFPD Captain Rick Yick. UPS and Apple are working with police on the investigation. Each phone that was stolen had its IMEI serial number catalogued along with a description. If there\u2019s a silver lining in all this, CNET reports that customers who planned to pick up their iPhone X at the Stonestown Apple store would still get their device on time. It's unlikely the theft will make a dent in Apple's coffers, with the company expecting to make $84 billion in sales this quarter off the back of its latest iPhones."}
