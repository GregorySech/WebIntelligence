{"title": "Intel\u2019s Compute Card, a credit card-sized PC, will ship in August", "content": " \nIntel unveiled its Compute Card, a credit card-sized device that\u2019s basically an entire PC, at CES this year. At Computex this week, the company officially launched the card with a full list of partners and what we can expect to see from them product-wise. These devices will all be at the show and vary widely. Sharp, for example, is showing off digital signage while Seneca and Foxconn are making mini PCs. LG is sticking the Compute Card in its monitors to turn them into all-in-ones. The card might also show up in tablets and interactive whiteboards. Nexdock will be showing something off, too, which we can assume is its touchscreen concept that it announced in January. Intel says the Compute Card will start shipping in August. \nWeirdly, Intel\u2019s most well-known partners, including Lenovo, HP, and Dell, aren\u2019t ready to show off their products. Intel says they\u2019ll definitely create something but we don\u2019t have an idea of what those devices might be. \nThe compute card will be available in four variants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Intel\n\n\nThe company\u2019s also putting out its design kit today that includes guides and reference designs for developers. The Compute Card might not take over, but it at least is giving us hope for a future of powerful pocket PCs.\n"}
