In a blog post published Wednesday, Google Arts and Culture said it has added more than 20,000 items to its online collection, as part of a partnership with more than 30 cultural institutions. \nThe collection includes digitized portraits and documents from every president in US history, as well as more personal artifacts such as a copy of Barbara Bush\u2019s favorite taco recipe and images from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s childhood. There are also 25 presidential portraits that can be viewed through Google\u2019s high-resolution Art Camera, which allows users to zoom in on the individual brushstrokes of each painting. Other sections are devoted to White House pets and presidential transportation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the digitized artifacts, Google has released 17 new 360-degree tours of various historical sites, which can be viewed through the Google Arts and Culture App and Google Cardboard. You can also use Google Expeditions to take a guided tour of the White House, just in time for Presidents\u2019 Day. \n"}
