{"content": " \nSnap published its third quarter earnings report as a public company this afternoon. This first two did not go well, and the third was no better. The company missed investors\u2019 expectations in terms of revenue and user growth, and the share price plunged over 15 percent in after-hours trading. \nThe company brought in $207 million in revenue for the third quarter, up 62 percent over the same period last year. But its losses expanded much faster: Snap lost $443 million in the third quarter, nearly quadruple the amount of cash it burned through during the same period in 2016. Around $40 million of that was a write-down for unsold Spectacles.\nSnap said it now has 178 million daily active users, up 17 percent year over year, and it has 4.5 million more daily active users than it did last quarter.\nSnap has been making progress in its efforts to automate its ad business. But the short term impact on revenue has been rough. \u201cOur efforts at automation have gained traction very quickly this year, with 80 percent of Snap Ad impressions delivered programmatically in Q3, up from zero percent one year ago,\u201d said Spiegal in his prepared remarks for today\u2019s investor call. \u201cThe speed of this transition surpassed our expectations, but has dramatically reduced pricing as advertisers move from direct sales to our unreserved auction. This has decreased CPMs more than 60 percent year-over-year, which has made it harder to grow revenues at the rate we would have liked.\u201d\nReports have indicated that downloads and public mentions of Snapchat have fallen steadily since the company went public. Both Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status have now passed Snapchat in size, with over 300 million monthly users each. Snap says it plans to start paying top creators to incentivize its top users, creating a virtuous cycle it hopes will attract more users.\nSnapchat has introduced a number of new augmented reality features in the past year. This offers up a new canvas for advertisers, but doesn\u2019t do much to simplify the process of self-serve advertising that could really act as a catalyst for revenue growth. The company also introduced Snap Maps, which shared users\u2019 locations. It\u2019s not clear yet if the company has any plans to tie that into its advertising business, but it has found ways to monetize geofilters in the past. \nHardware sales have never been a big part of Snap\u2019s revenue picture, but it has long sold investors on the idea that it\u2019s first and foremost a \u201ccamera company.\u201d It launched its Spectacles to a ton of fanfare and reportedly acquired a drone startup to explore producing its own flying camera. A few weeks ago, however, The Information reported that sales of Spectacles have slumped, and that hundreds of thousands of unsold units are now sitting in a warehouse. Snap\u2019s earnings report confirmed that, with a $40 million loss translating to roughly 300,000 pairs of Spectacles.\nSpiegel said in his prepared remarks that the company plans to dramatically redesign the app to make it easier for users to understand, a move Snap hopes will boost growth. But he warned it could have repercussions. \u201cThere is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don\u2019t yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application. We\u2019re willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial longterm benefits to our business.\u201d \n", "title": "Snap\u2019s stock price plummets after weak earnings"}
