{"title": "Katy Perry is livestreaming her entire weekend to promote her new album", "content": " \nRight now, Katy Perry is sleeping. I know this because I\u2019m currently watching Katy Perry sleep, thanks to a livestream set up in her bedroom. The live stream is a promotional stunt for her new album Witness, which came out today. As ET reports, Perry plans on spending this weekend inside a house with some fans and friends, where a camera crew will follow her around and stream the footage to YouTube.\nThe YouTube stream features five different camera views: one of Katy Perry inside the house, one of a man painting a mural outside the house, one featuring footage from last night\u2019s performance, and one of a girl setting up an elaborate chain of dominos (I can\u2019t explain that one). The last view is all four cameras at once. \nKaty Perry live, but not like a concert\nKaty Perry has been promoting Witness aggressively, even as the album\u2019s singles have failed to resonate with audiences. She appeared on Saturday Night Live, she landed a profile in Vogue, and she dropped several promo videos on Instagram. She tried to turn her single \u201cBon Appetit\u201d \u2014 which never even cracked Billboard\u2019s Top 40 \u2014 into a meme called the \u201cBon Appetit Challenge.\u201d Even her Met Gala gown doubled as an album advertisement. \nAnd it looks like Perry\u2019s got at least another weekend full of promo ahead of her \u2014 she should take her sleep where she can get it. \nLast night during an intimate performance in the house, Katy Perry reportedly said, \"I feel like I was born on the internet. I'm gonna have a rebirth on the internet.\" So basically what she\u2019s saying is, \u201cAre you ready to watch a live rebirth?\u201d\nAnswer the question by watching the live stream on YouTube above, or by ignoring it entirely. \n"}
