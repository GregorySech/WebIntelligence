Apple typically does a good job at battery optimization through software, so that could explain the smaller size. Still, it isn't an awesome feeling to know your expensive new phone features a slight downgrade, especially when battery life is crucial to device satisfaction.\nApple's competitors, like Google and Samsung, prioritize larger batteries. The Pixel and Pixel XL from last year have 2,770mAh and 3,450mAh batteries, respectively, while the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus feature 3,000mAh and 3,500mAh batteries. Apple\u2019s devices last about as long as those devices, though. So even though the company doesn't include the largest batteries available, its phones don't seem to be suffering.\n"}
