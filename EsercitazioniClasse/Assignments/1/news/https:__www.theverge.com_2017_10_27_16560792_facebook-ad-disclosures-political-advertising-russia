{"title": "Facebook announces new advertising disclosures days before Congressional hearings", "content": " \nNext week, Facebook will appear before the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees to answer questions about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But before it does, the company is laying out the steps it plans to take voluntarily to prevent foreign actors from interfering again. Facebook today said it would introduce its new disclosures around advertising next month, starting with a test in Canada before it rolled out more broadly elsewhere. \n\u201cWhen it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they\u2019re running, especially for political ads,\u201d said Rob Goldman, vice president of advertising, in a blog post. \u201cThat level of transparency is good for democracy and it\u2019s good for the electoral process.\u201d\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out the rough outlines of the plan in a blog post last month. Beginning in November, a new \u201cView Ads\u201d link will appear on advertiser pages. Clicking the link will take you to a page that shows all ads that the page is running. The new rules apply to both commercial and political advertising, and require that any ad on Facebook be linked to an advertiser page. It will be available in the United States by the summer, Facebook said, a few months before the US midterm elections. It will arrive in all other countries \u201caround the same time,\u201d Facebook said.\n\u201cWhen it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they\u2019re running, especially for political ads.\u201d\nWhen it expands the disclosures to the United States, Facebook said it would build an archive of ads related to federal elections. Users will be able to see both current and past political ads in a searchable archive, it said. The ads will be searchable for four years after they are posted, and will contain information about how much advertisers spent to promote them and how many impressions the ads received. Facebook will also disclose demographic information about the audience targeted by the ad, including age, location, and gender.\nMoreover, political advertisers will now have to identify themselves as such to Facebook. Beginning with US federal elections, advertisers will be asked to verify their identities and their locations, Facebook said. Election ads will include a disclosure on the ad that reads \u201cPaid for by.\u201d Clicking on it will take you to a page that includes information about the advertiser. Facebook is also building automated tools to identify political advertisers that do not identify themselves as such and force them to verify their identities, it said.\nThese steps don\u2019t go as far as the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan proposal that would create new federal regulations for online political advertising modeled on existing regulations for print and broadcast media. But there\u2019s no guarantee that Congress will take action. In the meantime, Facebooks\u2019s approach \u2014 and its effectiveness at making the source of advertising clear \u2014 will be closely studied.\n"}
