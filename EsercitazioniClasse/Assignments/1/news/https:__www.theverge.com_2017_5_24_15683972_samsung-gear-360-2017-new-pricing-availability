In addition to a redesigned form factor \u2014 the first camera was orb-shaped, while this one is an orb on a stick \u2014 the new model captures video in real 4K and is compatible with a wider variety of smartphones, including iPhones. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\n\nAt $229, the Gear 360 is now less expensive than the $327 Ricoh Theta S and the $400 Nikon KeyMission 360. Still, even with its new low price, the Gear 360 is more expensive than the $130 LG 360 CAM, which only records 2K video but captures 5.1-channel surround sound. \n"}
