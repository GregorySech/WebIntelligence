{"title": "Alexa can now set reminders for you", "content": " \nAmazon is rolling out an update to Alexa today that will bring a couple of critical new features that probably should\u2019ve been included when it launched two years ago. Reminders and named timers are both rolling out today, helping to improve Alexa\u2019s usefulness in your daily routine.\nYou can now say \u201cAlexa, remind me to take out the trash at 6PM,\u201d and it will notify you at the proper time. Alexa still lacks context for AM / PM reminders and alarms (unlike Siri and Google Assistant), which is actively annoying, so don\u2019t forget the abbreviation. \nJust like alarms, reminders are tied to the device you set them on, so don\u2019t expect to set a reminder in your office and hear it on the Echo in your kitchen just yet. And there isn\u2019t a way to sync reminders with third party services like Todoist, so if you already have a list of reminders, you\u2019ll have to manually add them to your Alexa. \nAlexa now supports named timers as well, which will definitely come in handy in the event that you\u2019re cooking multiple dishes. You can also check how much time is left on a certain timer by saying \u201cAlexa, how much time is left on my lasagna timer,\u201d and it will let you know.\nThe new features are rolling out today in the US, and will be available in the UK and Germany in the coming weeks.\n"}
