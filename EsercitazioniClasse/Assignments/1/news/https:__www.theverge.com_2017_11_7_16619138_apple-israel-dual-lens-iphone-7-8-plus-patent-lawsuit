{"title": "Israeli company sues Apple for dual lens camera patent infringement", "content": " \nIsraeli company Corephotonics filed a lawsuit against Apple yesterday, just as Apple was awarded $120 million by the Supreme Court after a prolonged battle with Samsung. Corephotonics, a maker of dual lens camera technology, claims that the cameras featured in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus infringe on four of its patents. \nThe Israeli company was founded in 2012 by Dr. David Medlovic, a Tel Aviv University professor and former chief scientist in the Israeli government. Corephotonics claims in the lawsuit that it reached out to Apple \u201cas one of its first acts as a company\u201d to establish a strategic partnership. The exchanges with the tech giant continued for a while but never resulted in a license agreement for Corephotonics\u2019 dual lens technology.\nThe relationship between Apple and Corephotonics then turned sour, the lawsuit alleges. It states, \u201cApple\u2019s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics\u2019 patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.\u201d Following that exchange, in January 2016, Corephotonics learned that Apple would be introducing the iPhone 7 Plus that year with a dual-aperture camera.\nCuriously, the iPhone X is left out of the lawsuit\nAs reported by MacRumors, Corephotonics named four patents it filed between 2012 and 2015 that it says Apple infringed: two patents on mini telephoto lens assembly, one patent on dual aperture zoom digital cameras, and one on high resolution thin multi-aperture imaging systems, which is essentially an umbrella term that covers what dual lens cameras are. The lawsuit highlights how Corephotonics\u2019 dual aperture camera technology has two fixed-focal length lenses, including a wide angle and a telephoto lens, which is what Apple uses in its iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus.\nSomehow, consumers also got roped into the lawsuit. Since Apple is selling the products with \u201cknowledge of or willful blindness\u201d of the patents it\u2019s allegedly infringing, the lawsuit claims that consumers who buy the iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus are infringing on the Corephotonics\u2019 telephoto lens assembly patent as well.\nThe suit demands monetary compensation for the lawyers the Israeli firm has had to hire as well as additional damages. It is also calling for Apple to stop using dual-aperture cameras immediately. Curiously, the iPhone X is left out of the lawsuit though it also uses dual lens camera technology, possibly because the suit was prepared before Apple\u2019s latest flagship phone reached physical stores in November.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Corephotonics and Apple for comment and will update if we hear back.
