{"title": "Garmin made Star Wars and Marvel fitness trackers for kids", "content": " \nGarmin has partnered with Disney to put BB-8, The Avengers, Minnie Mouse, and other popular characters on the bands for its newest fitness tracker, the Vivofit Jr. 2.\nThe Vivofit Jr. 2 is meant to be worn all day long and can track sleep, steps, and minutes of activity. It\u2019s swimproof and has a battery that\u2019s supposed to last one year on a single charge.\nThere are only two big differences between this version of the band and last year\u2019s debut model of the Vivofit Jr. First, this new model has a color screen, instead of a black and white one. And second, there\u2019s the branded bands \u2014 last year\u2019s models just included some colorful patterns, like flowers or pixelated camo, which seem a lot less fun for the young audience Garmin is trying to appeal to here. There will also be bands featuring the Captain America\u2019s shield and silhouettes of various Star Wars icons.\nCharacters from the bands will also show up a mobile app that connects to the fitness tracker. Kids can play through stories by completing activity goals and other tasks set for them by their parents. Garmin had this feature last year, but the in-app game had kids going through a jungle \u2014 and while jungles are cool, they are also not Star Wars themed.\nThe new fitness tracker will sell for $99.99, up $20 from the original model. Additional bands will be sold separately for $29.99 and can be used to open up different game themes inside the app.\n"}
