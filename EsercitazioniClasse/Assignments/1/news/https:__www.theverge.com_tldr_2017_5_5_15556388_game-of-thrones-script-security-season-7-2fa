{"title": "Game of Thrones makes its stars two-factor their emails now", "content": " \nHBO\u2019s Game of Thrones has always had to cope with bizarre threats to secrecy around its plot details \u2014 drones flying over set, rogue set photographers, its own actors accidentally posting scripts to Instagram. Then there\u2019s the unavoidable obsessive fan interest, which turn things like the length of Kit Harington\u2019s hair and a sighting of Rory McCann hanging out in a hotel lobby into spoilers.\nLast year, showrunner David Benioff and HBO programming president Michael Lombardo told Entertainment Weekly that they were cracking down for season 6 by cutting back on the number of people who received scripts. Press weren\u2019t given screeners for the first time, and it became standard practice to use code words on set.  \nBut now that the show is moving past the story of George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire for the first time with season 7, HBO is taking security even more seriously. \nHBO is moving past George R.R. Martin\u2019s books for the first time\nIn a recent interview with Express, actress Nathalie Emmanuel, who plays Daenerys\u2019 BFF Missandei, said the cast was required to set up two-factor authentication on their email accounts this year. They only received digital copies of the script through these accounts, and weren\u2019t allowed to print them. \nShe also mentioned that any notes they received during rehearsal weren\u2019t permitted to leave the set: \u201cYou might get given rehearsal notes on set, but you have to sign for and return them before you leave. If you don't, people will chase you until you give them back!\"\nThe added caution makes sense. Though there was plenty of concern about spoilers before, and the show did often deviate from Martin\u2019s books, the biggest arcs were things any impatient viewer could spoil for themselves with a cursory read of an A Song of Ice and Fire subreddit thread or Wiki page. \nThough, it seems like no matter what measures they take, things somehow leak. In an interview with The Huffington Post this week, Nikolaj Coster-Waudau, who plays Jaime Lannister, implied that pretty much every major plot point of season 7 has been spoiled online somewhere: \u201cIt\u2019s all out there by the way\u2026 if you can find it.\u201d But the secrets are still mostly safe, he explained, because \u201cthere\u2019s 10,000 other spoilers out there, they\u2019re not real. It just gets lost in the shuffle.\u201d \nGame of Thrones\u2019 seventh season premieres on July 16th, so I don\u2019t know, maybe stay off the internet until then. \n"}
