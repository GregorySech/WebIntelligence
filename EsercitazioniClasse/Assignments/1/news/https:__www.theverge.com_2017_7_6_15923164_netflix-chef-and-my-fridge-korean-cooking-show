{"title": "Netflix\u2019s Chef & My Fridge should be your newest cooking competition obsession", "content": " \nKorean variety show Chef & My Fridge, which hit Netflix this week, has everything and the kitchen sink. It has celebrity chefs, idol guest judges, and the aspirational optimism of every good cooking TV program: the idea that anyone can make restaurant-grade food at home with the humble, rapidly expiring ingredients waiting inside their refrigerator.\nThe show has aired in Korea since 2014, masterfully blending celebrity voyeurism with Iron Chef-esque intensity. Each episode, hosts raid a celebrity\u2019s fridge, which is literally lugged into the studio. A squad of chefs dutifully take notes on what\u2019s excavated from the fridge, mentally planning what meal they\u2019ll create from the haul. A pair of chefs are then chosen from the group to go head-to-head, creating a 15-minute meal they hope will appease the guest judges. \nThe first half of each episode plays like a talk show, with the hosts interviewing the two celebrity guests. If you\u2019re more interested in the cooking than the lives of Korean TV personalities, you might be inclined to skip ahead to the second half of the show, where the real competition starts. \nThe limited and common ingredients force chefs to flex their creativity, cooking up a meal in a pinch that encourages viewers to follow along at home if they\u2019re feeling particularly creative and adventurous. For example, in the first episode, a package of cinnamon biscuits is pulverized in a food processor to create cinnamon powder, the outer dusting for a churro-like fried tofu snack. \nBecause the chefs have to make do with the ingredients from another person\u2019s fridge, the amount of available food varies between episodes. One fridge will be filled with tons of fresh produce and meat; another fridge will offer nothing but frozen foods and some canned tuna. American viewers might not be familiar with the guests, but the fridges do a surprisingly solid job of capturing their character. In what has to be the absolute best-case scenario, we learn that K-pop idol G-Dragon\u2019s fridge is obscenely well-stocked with whole truffles from Paris and abalone the size of a Frisbee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Netflix\n\n\nWith releases like Chef & My Fridge, Netflix is making it way easier (and legal) to stay up to date on shows outside the US. It\u2019s especially been on top of adding international shows to its roster, bringing shows like Terrace House to wider audiences. The new wave of international content marks an escalation in competition between mainstream streaming services and niche streaming platforms like DramaFever and Crunchyroll.\nSpeaking from personal experience, it\u2019s always been pretty easy to watch Korean shows on streaming websites, and even YouTube has full, subtitled episodes of \u201cPlease take care of my refrigerator\u201d (the clunky, direct translation of its Korean title). But you have to know exactly where to look to find these streams, most of which illegal. Seeing Chef & My Fridge pop up on Netflix means that it\u2019s now easier to share TV recs than ever, and I don\u2019t have to direct my friends to shady, hard-to-navigate sites to get them to watch.\nI\u2019m also happy to report that my fridge has never been cleaner.\n"}
