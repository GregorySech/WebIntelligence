{"title": "Essential says it has improved its terrible camera with new software updates", "content": " \nEssential has released another update to address what is by far the weakest element of its debut smartphone: the camera. This latest attempt is a two-prong approach, as the company has simultaneously released a new firmware update for the phone itself and updated the Essential Camera app in the Play Store. \u201cOur small team has been hard at work improving the Essential Camera app,\u201d software engineer Michael Kolb wrote in a blog post. \nThe latest version of the camera app promises to \u201celiminate shutter lag for one-off captures.\u201d That delay when shooting even a single photo has been a major annoyance for users. Essential also claims to have improved low light photo quality and made all-around image output more consistent in various conditions. Here are the specifics of what you can expect to see after installing both updates:\n\nBoosted capture speed in regular and low light to below 1 second (over 40% faster)\nImproved brightness and performance in low-light\nSpatial sound when shooting in 360 (supported on device, Facebook and YouTube)\nUse volume up/down keys as shutter buttons in 360 mode\nCountdown timer when in 360 camera mode\nBug fixes and overall reliability improvements\n\nSeparately, Essential has also confirmed that it will be adding more modes and functionality to the sparse camera software. A Pro Mode is \u201cin the works,\u201d as are Portrait Mode and live-streaming to Facebook and Periscope using the 360-degree camera. \n\u201cSystem build NMI81C is starting to roll out today so expect to receive this update soon,\u201d the company said of the phone\u2019s software update. The end result of these updates will be a major test and example of just how much can be fixed and improved through software after a phone has already shipped. With the just-announced Pixel 2 shipping soon \u2014 and a slew of other Android options to choose from \u2014 Essential needs to work fast if it hopes to be a viable purchase for the $700 price. \n"}
