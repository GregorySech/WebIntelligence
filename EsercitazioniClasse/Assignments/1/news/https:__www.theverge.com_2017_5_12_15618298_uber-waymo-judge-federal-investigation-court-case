{"title": "Uber could face federal charges over alleged theft of Waymo trade secrets", "content": " \nThe legal case brought by Alphabet\u2019s Waymo against Uber for allegedly stealing self-driving car secrets is set to go to trial. Judge William Alsup, presiding over the case, denied Uber\u2019s request for arbitration on Thursday. That means the case will go to court, but the judge also recommended that the case go to federal prosecutors to investigate whether Uber is guilty of theft. The US Attorney still has yet to accept the case, but if it does and Uber is found guilty, it could face criminal prosecution.\nWaymo filed the explosive lawsuit in late February, claiming that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer and current vice president at Uber, had stolen 14,000 confidential documents \u2014 or 9.7 gigabytes of data \u2014 before leaving Google. Among the documents were trade secrets and patents, including Waymo\u2019s proprietary LIDAR system, the company claims.\nUber had tried to force the case into arbitration\nAccording to Waymo, Levandowski used the stolen technology to entice Uber into buying his self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million six months after it launched in 2016. Uber called the allegation \u201cbaseless,\u201d but recently was forced to admit that Google\u2019s self-driving technology was superior to its own. (Levandowski recently stepped aside as head of Uber\u2019s self-driving car unit.)\n\n\nBreaking: Alsup is referring the case to the US Attorney for a trade secret theft investigation pic.twitter.com/7QQpFOn9oD\u2014 kate conger (@kateconger) May 12, 2017\n\n\n\nUber\u2019s argument hinged on a clause in the contract between Levandowski and the company, which said that any future cases between Uber and the engineer\u2019s former employer should be settled in arbitration. But Waymo instead brought the case against Uber, while filing a separate case for arbitration against Levandowski over allegedly poaching Google employees.  \nThe judge struck down Uber\u2019s approach, saying that Waymo was within the law to pursue the case outside arbitration. \u201cDefendants have repeatedly accused Waymo of using \u2018artful\u2019 or \u2018tactical\u2019 pleading to evade its arbitration obligations by omitting Levandowski as a defendant,\u201d Alsup said. \u201cThese accusations are unwarranted.\u201d\nThe US Attorney may not pick up the case\n\u201cWaymo has honored its obligation to arbitrate against Levandowski by arbitrating its claims (concerning employee poaching) against Levandowski. Its decision to bring separate claims against defendants in court was not only reasonable but also the only course available, since Waymo had no arbitration agreement with defendants,\u201d the judge wrote in court documents. Alsup also noted that Levandowski\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights \u201chas obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants\u2019 ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo\u2019s purloined files.\u201d\nWaymo responded favorably to Alsup\u2019s decision, indicating that it would continue to keep up the pressure on its rival. \u201cThis was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court\u2019s jurisdiction. We welcome the court\u2019s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,\u201d a spokesperson said. \nIt\u2019s not clear yet whether the US Attorney will indeed take up the case, or whether Uber would be found guilty in a criminal case, but it wouldn\u2019t be an ideal situation for a company that has found itself in hot water lately in both the courts of law and public opinion. It wouldn\u2019t even be Uber\u2019s only federal investigation this year, after the Justice Department reportedly started inquiring into the company\u2019s use of the controversial \u201cGreyball\u201d software that allegedly identified government workers.\n"}
