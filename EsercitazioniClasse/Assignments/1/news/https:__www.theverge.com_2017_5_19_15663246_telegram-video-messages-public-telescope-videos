{"title": "Telegram adds video messages and public \u2018Telescope\u2019 videos", "content": " \nTelegram released its latest 4.0 update this week, and one of the biggest features being added is video messages, which allows users to send video clips to each other at the push of a button. It\u2019s similar to the app\u2019s addition of audio messages \u2014 in fact, to access the video message feature, users simply tap the existing audio icon to switch to video mode. \nLike audio messages, Telegram\u2019s video messages are automatically downloaded and autoplayed by default, and feature a picture-in-picture mode within Telegram so you can do other things in the app while watching a video. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut along with private video messages, Telegram is looking to expand its public channels by adding video there as well, in a feature called Telescope. Telescope videos, like Telegram video messages, are clips up to a minute long, but they\u2019ll be publicly available through a direct URL, even to people without Telegram accounts. \nBoth features should be available now as Telegram\u2019s 4.0 update rolls out. \n"}
