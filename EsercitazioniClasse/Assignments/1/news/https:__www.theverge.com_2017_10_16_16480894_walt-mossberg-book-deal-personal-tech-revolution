{"title": "Walt Mossberg is writing a book", "content": " \nOur friend Walt Mossberg may have retired, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s out of things to say: he\u2019s signed a deal with St. Martin\u2019s Press to write a book about the incredible rise of tech over the past 40 years, and what\u2019s to come in the next decade. Tim Bartlett will be the editor.\nThe book is scheduled to come out in the early fall of 2019. \u201cI\u2019m going to take about a year to write it,\u201d Walt tells me, suggesting his final column is \u201cnot a bad outline.\u201d\n\u201cEvery single thing that\u2019s digital \u2014 the iPod, your favorite laptop, your phone \u2014 it\u2019s all less than 40 years old.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the unbelievably compressed period in which the personal tech revolution has changed the world at every level, in every walk of life,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery single thing that\u2019s digital \u2014 e-readers, the iPod, your favorite laptop, your phone \u2014 it\u2019s all less than 40 years old. It\u2019s younger than Starbucks. It\u2019s younger than Disneyland. And it began to get massive traction in the \u201890s, when I entered the picture.\u201d\nOf course, the book will feature tons of products and stories about the people behind them. \u201cSome of the products were flops, but they mattered,\u201d says Walt. \u201cThere\u2019ll be people like Jobs and Gates, but also other people like Jeff Hawkins and Philippe Kahn, who did the first camera phone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWalt says he\u2019ll \u201copen the filter a little wider and be a little more liberal\u201d in telling these stories than he\u2019s previously been in his column or on his Ctrl-Walt-Delete podcast. There will be also be several stories he\u2019s never told before, including his visit to a very sick Steve Jobs at his house to see the first iPad before it was public.\nMost importantly, Walt also wants to use the book to highlight the responsibility the tech giants now have. \u201cTo me, the tech revolution has been a net positive, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a close call,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there have been unintended consequences, like elections and harassment. The two things tie together in the headlong rush to do the next thing with no one asking questions along the way. We\u2019ve never stopped to catch a breath.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the capstone of my career.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been preaching privacy, security, and fairness to consumers for a long time. I think you can do that and also say these things are cool and useful.\u201d\nWalt says he\u2019ll be leaning on his own archive of columns and interviews, while also doing some additional reporting as he writes the book. \u201cThis is the capstone of my career and my thinking about this revolution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe things that are coming are going to be just as disruptive. Probably more disruptive.\u201d\n"}
