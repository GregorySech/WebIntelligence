The next iPhone\u2019s screen design and face unlock / virtual home button features were previously revealed in the HomePod firmware, and now references to a new Apple TV have been spotted. iOS developer Guilherme Rambo\u200f has discovered hints at a 4K Apple TV, complete with high dynamic range (HDR) support for both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Apple\u2019s existing TV set-top box doesn\u2019t support 4K, and we\u2019ve been waiting for the company to adopt the ultra high-definition format.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nApple TV 4K review: so close, so far\n\nRumors of a new Apple TV with 4K and HDR have existed for months. Bloomberg first reported back in February that Apple is planning to support 4K content with \u201cmore vivid colors.\u201d HDR support in any upcoming Apple TV will be key, and HDR is often a lot more impressive than just a simple resolution bump for movies and TV shows. Netflix and Amazon both support HDR and 4K video, and even Google Play started streaming in 4K and HDR recently.\niTunes also started listing movies as supporting 4K and HDR in users\u2019 purchase histories last month, fueling more speculation that a 4K Apple TV is on the way. With the iOS code powering Apple\u2019s new speaker now referencing a 4K Apple TV, it looks all but certain that the company will refresh its TV hardware soon.\n\n\n4K HDR Apple TV?
