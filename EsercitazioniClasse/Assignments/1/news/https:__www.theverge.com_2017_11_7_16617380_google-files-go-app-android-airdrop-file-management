{"content": " Google appears to be working on a new app called Files Go that\u2019ll work as a way to manage, clean up, and share files. It\u2019s that last one that seems the most interesting here: Files Go seems to have a feature that works a lot like Apple\u2019s AirDrop, letting you easily send files to nearby Android phones over Bluetooth.The file-transfer feature doesn\u2019t appear to work quite as smoothly as AirDrop. Both people need to have the Files Go app open, whereas AirDrop lets you send files from any app to any nearby contact, even if they don\u2019t have the same app.Still, it\u2019d be a nice addition to Android if Google began shipping this as a stock app. Right now, the best way to send a file to a nearby phone is by using Android Beam, which requires tapping the two phones together to make an NFC connection. It works, but it\u2019s an odd interaction that a lot of people don\u2019t seem to know about. Putting a file-sharing feature inside an app clearly about managing files seems a lot more discoverable.Files Go seems to be designed for Android GoUnfortunately, Files Go isn\u2019t available yet. The app was spotted in the Play Store yesterday in a closed beta program, and it\u2019s since been removed. It also isn\u2019t clear how widely it\u2019ll get released once it\u2019s ready. Given the \u201cGo\u201d name, it seems likely to be part of Google\u2019s Android Go initiative, which is making a stripped-down version of Android that runs on phones with slower hardware. The goal is to make Android work better on these phones, so that the OS will be adopted by people in countries where smartphones are just starting to permeate.Files Go is less than 10MB large, and the app\u2019s other features are about clearing up space, so it seems to play into the Go initiative pretty clearly. The app has a dashboard that shows how much storage your phone has left, includes a button to clear cached files, and it highlights large files you can delete to free up space. It\u2019ll also suggest removing apps that it looks like you aren\u2019t using anymore. The app includes a files manager as well to let you look through local photos, videos, music, and other documents.These features aren\u2019t new to Android. There are already ways to browse your local files, free up space, and share documents. But there isn\u2019t one easy-to-use management app like this just yet. So even though Google seems to be working on this for one specific segment of Android, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to offer it to everyone.", "title": "Google's Files Go app is kind of like AirDrop for Android"}
