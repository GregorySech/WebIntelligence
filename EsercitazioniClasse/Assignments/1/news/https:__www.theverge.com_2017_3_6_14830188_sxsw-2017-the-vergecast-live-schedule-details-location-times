{"title": "Come see The Vergecast Live at SXSW on March 12th and 14th!", "content": " \nAustin residents both permanent and temporary, do you want to hang out with The Verge? Or rather, hang out with another while The Verge performs on stage for your amusement? We will be recording The Vergecast live in front of your very eyes for two shows during SXSW! See Nilay, Dieter, and special guests discuss, critique, joke, disagree, argue, re-agree, laugh, cry, maybe cry a little more, and possibly probably drink on stage on Sunday March 12th and Tuesday March 14th. Doors open at noon for both shows. \nAs part of National Geographic\u2019s Further Base Camp, the company has taken over the Vulcan Gas Company in downtown Austin (418 E 6th Street, to be exact) and invited us to do a couple shows on stage. (Our best friends at Recode are also doing live recordings next week.) No SXSW badges are needed for these. Come say hi and let us entertain you!\nThere are plenty of other great shows going on at Further Base Camp, but here are the ones we\u2019re most excited about (all times local):\n\nFriday, March 10th at 4PM: Recode Media podcast, hosted by Peter Kafka, with guest Glenn Beck\nSaturday, March 11th at 12:30PM: Too Embarrassed to Ask, hosted by Kara Swisher and Lauren Goode, with guest Mary Lou Jepsen\n\nSunday, March 12th at 12:30PM: The Vergecast (doors open at noon)\n\nMonday, March 13th at 12PM: Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, with guests Tim Simons and Matt Walsh from HBO\u2019s Veep\n\n\nTuesday, March 14th at 12:30PM: The Vergecast again! (doors open at noon)\n\n\nAnd if you do have a SXSW, check out this panel on immersive horror featuring our own Bryan Bishop!\nGot all that? Great. We\u2019ll see ya soon!\n\n"}
