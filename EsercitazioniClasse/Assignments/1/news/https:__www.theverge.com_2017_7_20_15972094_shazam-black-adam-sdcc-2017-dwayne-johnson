{"title": "Shazam will be the next DC Universe movie after Justice League and Aquaman", "content": " \nShazam will begin production in early 2018 and may be released in theaters by 2019, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The report pegs David F. Sandberg as the film\u2019s director. The production will begin ahead of Batgirl, Flash, and the sequels to both Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman.\nShazam has been on DC\u2019s film slate for a while, beginning with the 2014 announcement that Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson will play Shazam\u2019s archrival, Black Adam. The Hollywood Reporter wasn\u2019t able to confirm if Johnson will appear in Shazam or just the Black Adam spinoff film.\nShazam, also known as Captain Marvel, is one of DC\u2019s most popular superheroes, but this will be the first time he\u2019s appeared in a feature-length, big-screen, live-action movie. Shazam is the superhero alter ego of Billy Batson, a boy who, by saying the magical word \u201cshazam,\u201d turns into, well, Shazam. He can fly. He can go fast. And best of all, he has these powers, thanks to a 3,000-year-old wizard. Comic book movies are embracing their inner weirdness!\nWith Shazam and the batch of other films a couple years away, we\u2019re entering a slower period for the DC cinematic universe. Justice League will be released on November 17th, 2017. It will be followed by Aquaman on December 21th, 2018.\n"}
