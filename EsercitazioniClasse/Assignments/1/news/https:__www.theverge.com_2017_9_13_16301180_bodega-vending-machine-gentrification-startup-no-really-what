{"title": "Bodega is either the worst-named startup of the year, or the most devious", "content": " \nIf you live in a US city, you may occasionally visit your local bodega \u2014 a type of convenience store that has long resisted the pressure of franchise chains and branding. Bodegas are known as charming local small businesses frequently staffed by adorable cats, providing a variety of minor necessities at semi-reasonable prices. So naturally, there\u2019s a startup that wants to destroy them. The company is literally called \u201cBodega,\u201d and it\u2019s either the worst-named startup of the year, or one of the greatest Silicon Valley heel gimmicks of all time.\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: the Bodega\u2122 \u201cbodega\u201d is an indoor vending machine. As Fast Company describes it, it\u2019s a locked box designed to be placed in apartments, gyms, offices, and dormitories. It has some kind of fancy auto-payment system and uses machine learning (or maybe just \u201ccounting inventory,\u201d who knows) to figure out the most popular items in each location and serve more of them.\nThis is the Martin Shkreli of vending machines\nThis seems only tangentially in competition with real bodegas. For one thing, if you think most apartment buildings have a well-kept lobby that could fit a wide, delicate-looking wood-and-glass box, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve been within five miles of a bodega. For another, something that sells small non-perishable items sounds more like a corner drugstore than a bodega, but I guess you can\u2019t trademark \u201cCVS.\u201d And finally, the killing blow: can a vending machine sell you beer at 2AM?\nIf Bodega\u2122 were named \u201cVendr\u201d or some similarly boring moniker, I doubt there\u2019d be any backlash. The boxes could eat into the profits of brick-and-mortar stores in general, but only in a generic way, and often in places where they\u2019d just be replacing other vending machines. (One of Fast Company\u2019s use cases is a sorority house, which is probably not a huge source of bodega revenue.)\nSo why would two ex-Google employees, who had at least enough social intelligence to sell this to investors, pitch their business as a virtual parody of Silicon Valley rapaciousness? Why would you intentionally pitch a product as expediting gentrification and killing businesses specifically associated with people of color and immigrants? It would be bad enough if the founders really seemed poised to replace the bodega, a beloved and vital fixture of urban life. If they\u2019re not, it\u2019s as though someone made a sturdy boot and called it the \u201cpuppy kicking machine.\u201d\nWell, maybe this is why:\n\n\ncouple assholes invented a vending machine: https://t.co/igjyOMTn3D\u2014 jes skolnik (@modernistwitch) September 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nSo two dudes are selling a vending machine and calling it a BODEGA? Come on. This 2017. Please stop. https://t.co/1Pd9LlAA93\u2014 Julio Ricardo Varela (@julito77) September 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nBros: Here's a bougie vending machine.Fast Co: These disruptors will change the way you eat and thus alter the course of human evolution. https://t.co/q6DQ35oRTO\u2014 Evan Weiss (@eaweiss) September 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you've invented vending machines. https://t.co/fIHp9NjJWL\u2014 Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) September 13, 2017\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s better to be hated than ignored, then Bodega\u2122 has absolutely succeeded. An updated version of a boring product is far less worthy of press coverage and Twitter fury than the vending machine equivalent of Martin Shkreli. Meanwhile, the businesses that would buy Bodegas\u2122 probably don\u2019t care about tone-deaf branding, unless customers actively protest the machines. Maybe in our well-meaning desire to protect a thing we love, we\u2019ve played right into its hands. (And yes, that last tweet is mine.)\nThen again, this is the industry that produced Juicero and JetSmarter. I might be giving Bodega\u2122 too much credit.\n"}
