{"title": "Google is apparently shipping some Pixel 2 XLs without an operating system", "content": " Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 XL has been beset by a host of problems since release, ranging from possible issues of screen burn in to a weird clicking noise to failing a quality control test to shipping with empty packaging for a non-existent pair of wired Pixel Buds. But even so, it\u2019s a little surprising to hear that some Google Pixel 2 XL owners are reporting that their new phones have shown up missing an operating system, via AndroidPolice. Photo: @trevorftard / ImgurAs seen in the image above, the afflicted phones report being unable to find a valid operating system. Visiting the provided link doesn\u2019t really help, either, as it doesn\u2019t list this error message as an issue. If you\u2019ve got a phone that came without Android, your best bet is to send it back to Google and hope that your replacement actually comes with an operating system. Update November 3rd, 10:50am: Google has said the the problem has been fixed."}
