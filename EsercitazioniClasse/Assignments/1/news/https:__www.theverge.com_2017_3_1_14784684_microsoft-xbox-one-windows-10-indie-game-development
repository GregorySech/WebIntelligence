{"title": "Microsoft now lets anyone create and publish Xbox games", "content": " \nMicrosoft today announced a new initiative to let any game developer create and sell games on its Xbox platform without having to go through any of the company\u2019s preexisting channels. The Xbox Live Creators Program, as it\u2019s called, is designed to let an indie team or solo developer take a retail Xbox, which doubles as a dev kit, and use it to create and self-publish the title to the Xbox marketplace. Prior to today, developers had to part of an established game development or media company, or they had to apply through Microsoft\u2019s ID@Xbox indie game program to receive self-publishing capabilities. \nAnyone can now make and publish Xbox games\nThat are a couple of stipulations involved with the new program, which remains in a preview stage for now until it opens up to the general public soon. For one, the game you\u2019re making must be a Universal Windows App, so that it can run on any Windows 10 device and not simply the Xbox One. Microsoft also reserves the right to remove your game from the store if it has \u201charmful or inappropriate content,\u201d as the company won\u2019t be binding any devs with nondisclosure agreements or concept approvals. \nThe program isn\u2019t free. There\u2019s a one-time fee to that ranges from $20 to $100, and it\u2019s unclear right now how Microsoft plans on charging some developers more or less than others. Even then, unless a developer joins the ID@Xbox program, they won\u2019t be able to enable online multiplayer for the Xbox version of the game or access the Xbox achievements feature. The Creators Program does let you still access Xbox\u2019s leaderboards and party chat features. In one potential downside, games listed through the program will be kept in a separate section of the Xbox Store, which could limit their exposure to reach as wide an audience as ID@Xbox titles. \n\n\nThis is the most worrying part. It sounds like (though I could be wrong) that these games won't appear in the main store. pic.twitter.com/iBkeMejUKQ\u2014 Nick Gravelyn (@nickgravelyn) March 1, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the Creators Program, anyone can integrate Xbox Live sign-in, presence, and social features into their UWP games, then publish their game to Xbox One and Windows 10,\u201d Chris Charla, director of the ID@Xbox program, wrote in a blog post. \u201cThis means their title can see exposure to every Xbox One owner across the Xbox One family of devices, including Project Scorpio this holiday, as well as hundreds of millions of Windows 10 PCs, and millions of folks using the Xbox app on mobile platforms.\u201d\n"}
