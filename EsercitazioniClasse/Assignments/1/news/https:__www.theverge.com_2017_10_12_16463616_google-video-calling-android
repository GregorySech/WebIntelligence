{"title": "Google simplifies Android video calling", "content": " \nGoogle is rolling out simpler video calling on mobile for Android users. Those wanting to make a video call will be able do so straight from the Phone, Contacts, and Android Messages apps. The integration is as tight as you\u2019d expect (as seen in the GIF above) with the option to start video presented in the same list of options where you\u2019d call or text a contact. Google says it will add a function later that allows you to upgrade an ongoing voice call to video with a single tap.\nWhen the video call is made, it\u2019ll be routed through your carrier\u2019s ViLTE service (video over LTE). If you\u2019re not on a carrier with that service, Google will link the call through its Duo app, as long as both parties have it installed. The integrated video calling feature is already rolling out to Pixel, Pixel 2, Android One, and Nexus phones. Google is working with carriers to make the feature available on other Android devices, but the company hasn\u2019t given a specific timeline. \n\n"}
