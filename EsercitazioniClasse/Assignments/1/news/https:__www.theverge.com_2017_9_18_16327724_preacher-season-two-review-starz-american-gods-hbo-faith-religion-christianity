{"title": "How Preacher and American Gods take similar fantasies in opposite directions", "content": " \n\u201cI believe,\u201d Shadow breathes in the final episode of season one of the Starz series American Gods. Ricky Wittle, who plays Shadow, wears a beatific smile as he speaks; it\u2019s supposed to be the emotional climax of the series. But the smile looks overdetermined and vapid, like the grin of a car salesman, not a Buddha. Shadow\u2019s belief is vocal but unbelievable \u2014 especially after watching the recent season-two finale of the much more theologically cynical AMC show Preacher. American Gods touts the virtues of faith, but that faith is so vague, it ends up being meaningless. Preacher\u2019s blasphemy, on the other hand, carries conviction. You don\u2019t bother to hate God unless you really think he\u2019s there. \nFrom a brief description, American Gods and Preacher sound like similar shows. Both are road-trip buddy shows built around the concept \u201cWhat if gods were real?\u201d In American Gods (based on the 2001 Neil Gaiman novel) this means all gods. The show includes mythological figures from Scandinavia, Ireland, Central Europe, Egypt, West Africa, and who knows where else. In Preacher (based on the late-1990s comic book by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon), the frame is singularly Christian. Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) is mysteriously inhabited by a mystical entity called Genesis, which makes people obey his every command. In the series\u2019 second season, Jesse, his girlfriend Tulip (Ruth Negga), and their Irish vampire hanger-on Cassidy (Joe Gilgun) set off in search of God so Jesse can use his power to force God to answer some tough questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMC\n\n\nThe quest is necessary because God isn\u2019t readily accessible; he\u2019s gone missing, and no one on Earth or in heaven or hell is sure what happened to him. The metaphorical implications of \u201csearching for God\u201d are obvious, and the show is, to some degree, framed as a spiritual quest. As a child, Jesse saw his father killed in front of him, and he wants to be a good man, or he tells himself he does. He wanders from New Orleans jazz bar to New Orleans jazz bar (God likes jazz) asking if anyone\u2019s seen God, and beating up people who mock him for asking if anyone\u2019s seen God.\nIn American Gods, people create gods, not the other way around\nIn American Gods, Shadow is searching for faith too. His wife dies in a car crash while giving oral sex to another man just days before Shadow is released from prison. Grief-stricken and adrift, Shadow is hired as a bodyguard by Wednesday (Ian McShane), a.k.a. the Norse god Odin. Traveling with Odin is a journey of miracles, which American Gods films in a lush, saturated, lingering, hyper-real style. Over the course of the season, Shadow summons snow, encounters his resurrected zombie-wife, and meets multiple versions of Jesus, all glowing with a nimbus of light around their heads.\nAt first, the spiritual effects distress Shadow, but eventually, he embraces them. The gods, Wednesday explains, need human belief. People create gods, not the other way around. People who want to live in a world of wonder only need to believe they live in a world of wonder. Those who have faith in leprechauns will be surrounded by colorful, cursing leprechauns, spreading their gold coins around. A positive attitude transforms the multiverse. It\u2019s mythology as self-help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarz\n\n\nIn Preacher, by contrast, divinity doesn\u2019t need human belief. Jesse insists he\u2019s special because he\u2019s been chosen by the Genesis entity, and maybe he is, but God doesn\u2019t seem to care much. Encounters with the divine in American Gods are transcendent. In the case of the Queen of Sheba (Yetide Badaki), they\u2019re even orgasmic. But in Preacher, divinity is an anticlimactic bad joke. Perhaps the season\u2019s best episode involves an angel stuck on earth, who wants to die but can\u2019t, because angels instantly reincarnate after they\u2019re killed. He ends up working a nightclub act where he\u2019s hideously dismembered each evening, then miraculously reappears in a flash of light, to the crowd\u2019s delight and his own blank disappointment. There\u2019s a cheerfully shocking Jesus sex scene in which the virginal son of God undertakes a pornographic marathon with a married woman. The upshot is a child, leading to a line of more and more inbred divine children. When Jesse kneels before the great-great-grandson of the savior, the man pees on him. He\u2019s mentally an infant.\nIn Preacher, divinity doesn\u2019t need human belief\nUsing stigma against the intellectually disabled to mock Christianity (in both the original comic and the television show) isn\u2019t a terrific story choice. The bizarre outfit God dons in the series perhaps works better as an offensive anti-religion gag. In either case, though, the blasphemy comes across as bitterly sincere; if the show were higher-profile, it\u2019s hard to imagine it wouldn\u2019t spark some Christian protests. \nThe antipathy to Christianity in the show is partly anger at the way religion leads people to do evil, in the same way suggested by The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Jesse\u2019s certainty that he\u2019s been chosen leads him to ignore his friends and his basic humanity. He refuses to use his Genesis power to help Cassidy\u2019s ailing, aged son Dennis (Ronald Guttman), basically because he thinks healing the sick is beneath him. Ruth Negga, as Tulip, projects escalating exasperation and isolation through the series, as Jesse\u2019s pointless obsession with God and with his own power steadily, tediously takes over his life. In American Gods, there are numerous pregnant silences as characters contemplate the ineffable. In Preacher, the silences between Tulip, Cassidy, and Jesse are mundane miscommunication; Jesse\u2019s navel-gazing pursuit of the divine leaves him unable to talk to, or care about, his own friends. Even when the tough-as-nails Tulip is nearly killed, and suffers severe PTSD, Jesse remains focused on the literal state of his own soul. When Tulip finally dumps him, it\u2019s easy to wonder what took her so long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMC\n\n\nAs season two plays out, Preacher shows the ugliness of Jesse\u2019s religious obsessions. But it also quietly shares at least some of them. Jesse is angry because the world is arbitrary, cruel, and absurd. And Preacher the show also sees the world as arbitrary, cruel, and absurd. The show\u2019s vision of hell is of a petty, malfunctioning bureaucracy, filled with jerks and bullies (including, unfortunately, Adolf Hitler). Jesse himself is an example of the universe\u2019s ugly arbitrariness. In the comic, the character basically has his heart in the right place; in the TV show, though, Jesse is a self-righteous, trigger-tempered jerk, who goes on a rampage of violence and torture when he discovers Tulip has an ex. He\u2019s been given great power, and he uses it to treat people like crap. What kind of divine plan is that?\nIn American Gods, there are lots of divine plans. Gobs of gods and other mystical beings manipulate, scheme, and twist fate about their fingers. This is supposed to be exciting \u2014 a celebration of the profligacy of human invention and imagination. But while American Gods has a geeky D&D pleasure in name-dropping entities out of different far-flung mythos, it lacks the urgency and commitment that comes with actual belief. Shadow says at the conclusion of the first season that he believes in \u201ceverything,\u201d which is the same as saying he believes in nothing. But when Jesse looks into the black eyes of God, the emptiness has a disquieting solidity. For Shadow, believing in any story will do. For Jesse, though, it really matters whether this God in particular is real. For better or worse, that\u2019s faith.\n"}
