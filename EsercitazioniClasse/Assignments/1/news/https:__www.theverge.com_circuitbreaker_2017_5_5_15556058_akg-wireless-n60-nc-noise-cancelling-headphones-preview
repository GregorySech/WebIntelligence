{"title": "AKG\u2019s wireless N60 NC headphones are even better than the wired ones", "content": " \nIt\u2019s my job to listen to a lot of headphones. And it\u2019s my pleasure to write about the experience in a hopefully enlightening fashion. Today\u2019s job-pleasure thing has to do with AKG\u2019s excellent set of noise-cancelling on-ear headphones called the N60 NC. I reviewed the wired variant in November and really liked it. At CES, however, AKG did the obvious and cut the cord with a wireless N60 NC, which finally made their way to me this week and I\u2019m delighted by just how good these new headphones are.\nIs this a kneejerk reaction? Absolutely. But my knee is only jerking around because I can\u2019t stop tapping my foot to the sound of these AKGs. Priced at just under $300, these compete directly against the likes of the Beats Solo 3 and the Beoplay H4, both of which I have reviewed, and they win. Neither Beats nor B&O Play offer active noise cancelling at this price, whereas the AKG N60 NC does a great job of tuning out everything exterior and leaving me with my tunes and my thoughts. AKG\u2019s pair also collapses down into a very compact shape that can be protected with a provided pouch. Only other thing I\u2019d ask for might be a USB-C charging connection and a slightly more lovable name.\nThe N60 NC is bassy in just the right way. I\u2019m under no illusions about it being neutral or of an audiophile quality, and I get the sense that neither is AKG. This is just fun, punchy, dynamic sound that deluges the ear with pleasing notes. Bass is the first thing you lose when you go outside into a noisy environment, but with NC enabled and the appropriate tuning from AKG, these headphones will make for a perfect commuter pair you can just keep permanently tucked into a corner of your work bag. Bonus: AKG claims up to 30 hours of battery life (15 hours with NC turned on), so they won\u2019t be running out of juice in a hurry either. Wireless headphones have been improving in quality very quickly over the past year, and the AKG N60 NC Wireless keep that momentum going.\n"}
