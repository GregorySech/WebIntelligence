{"title": "Mewtwo is coming to Pok\u00e9mon Go soon in new invite-only raids", "content": " \nAt the Pok\u00e9mon Go Stadium show in Yokohama, attending players were able to capture the newly available pok\u00e9mon: legendary Mewtwo. Soon, fellow trainers around the world will have a chance as well. Developer Niantic said that Mewtwo will be available to players worldwide \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d as part of a new, invite-only multiplayer feature called \u201cexclusive raid battles.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \nI just caught Mewtwo at Japan's Pok\u00e9mon Go Stadium\n\n\nCooperative raid battles were added to the game as part of Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s big summer update, and the exclusive versions work in largely the same way. You\u2019ll still be teaming up with fellow trainers to take down powerful pok\u00e9mon that are only available for a limited time. The difference with the exclusive raids is that not everyone will get a chance to participate, as it\u2019s for the more dedicated players.\n\u201cUnlike existing raids, trainers will be invited to join an exclusive raid battle,\u201d Niantic explains. \u201cTo receive an invitation to participate in an exclusive raid battle, trainers must have successfully completed a raid recently, by defeating the raid boss, at the gym where the exclusive raid battle will be taking place. The invitations will include advance warning of when the exclusive raid will take place, giving them ample time to coordinate with other trainers before taking on the powerful raid boss.\u201d\nMewtwo will be the first pok\u00e9mon featured when these battles launch, but expect to see other monsters as well.\n"}
