{"title": "The 2018 Honda Odyssey turns the screens on your passengers", "content": " \nCars have become expensive rolling gadgets, full of screens, speakers, and sensors \u2014 but are they actually good gadgets? In our new series, ScreenDrive, we\u2019ll review cars just like any other device, starting with the basics of what they\u2019re like to use.\nThe sounds of shrieking and yelling in a car shouldn\u2019t be normal for most people \u2014 unless you own a family van. But inside the eight-seat 2018 Honda Odyssey, the screaming didn\u2019t come from young children fighting over headphones for the built-in TV monitor, or what movie to watch. The shriekers were my adult passengers, freaking out over a live camera feed of their faces displayed on the main infotainment screen.\nIn a world where we tape over our laptop cameras and wonder if our smart home speakers are actively listening even when they\u2019re not called upon, it\u2019s no surprise that some people are averse to any potential form of surveillance. Interior-facing cameras are typically found in police cars or taxi cabs \u2014 not personal vehicles. To be fair, none of those vehicles are also designed to be family friendly, so in my brief week with the Odyssey, I started wondering if constant monitoring is just something we\u2019re conditioning people to get accustomed to from a young age.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISPLAY\nLet\u2019s backtrack and talk about the screen itself. The 2018 Honda Odyssey\u2019s main infotainment display has been entirely refreshed from last year\u2019s model, as the company has moved from its own HondaLink system to a faster, updated version built on Android Lollipop. The 8-inch display looks and feels like a mounted tablet, with right-aligned Home and Return buttons and large icons on the screen for you to swipe through. There\u2019s a horizontal status bar across the top that also lets you add shortcuts to your most frequented menu items, such as Maps, Radio, or Android Auto. The HD display is crisp and clear, with bright colors differentiating each menu icon.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, like most tablets, the glossy surface also means the screen is prone to messy fingerprint smears. The Odyssey\u2019s screen is so shiny that every touch retains the grease from your fingertip, making it difficult to glance at when driving on a sunny day. \nThankfully, this problem is mitigated by the secondary screen ahead of the wheel. Most entry-level cars use this screen to display additional information, such as remaining fuel, current song, or your Bluetooth-paired phone\u2019s recently dialed numbers. The Odyssey\u2019s secondary screen, like many newer, higher-end model cars, offers turn-by-turn directions ahead of the wheel, so you don\u2019t have to shift your eyes to the right or listen to the Odyssey\u2019s awful robot voice. You can also use buttons on the wheel to switch between Honda\u2019s system and Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, or even change the audio from whatever is playing on the radio to whatever your passengers are watching / listening to on the back TV screen.\nSpeaking of the back TV screen, the 10.2-inch single-image WSVGA display has been updated with some built-in entertainment apps, too. There are a variety of child-friendly entertainment apps, such as PBS Kids Video and HappyKids.TV, and one that coordinates a rocket ship with your current drive time to show how long you\u2019ve been on the road. (I imagine this one gets old quickly.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are apps for older audiences, too, including Epix and Spotify, which come preinstalled in the Odyssey. I was unable to find parental controls or password protection for adult content for these apps, meaning kids could easily access content not meant for their eyes and ears. Shortly after the Odyssey came on the market, some drivers noticed that the Epix app failed to remove an Erotic section, offering backseat passengers a library of sexually explicit content. Honda has since updated the software to remove this category, but kids might still be able to stream expletive-laden songs on Spotify. The week I drove the Odyssey, Lil Yachty\u2019s Teenage Emotions had just dropped, so it was the first thing I clicked on after the app loaded. (The chorus to Yachty\u2019s opening song, \u201cLike a Star,\u201d goes: \u201cI'd rather do it than say and I done did it all before / I done had sex with six different whores at the same time on they grandmother's back porch.\u201d)\nTo note, these streaming apps only work if you\u2019re opting to pay for the monthly AT&T 4G LTE service offered for the Odyssey Touring and Elite models, so beyond parental controls, you\u2019ll also need to consider the additional charge on top of upgrading to the most premium tier.\nThe last \u201cdisplay\u201d technically associated with the Odyssey is the accompanying CabinControl smartphone app, which lets you adjust temperature, make TV screen selections, or collaborate with other passengers in the car to create a \u201csocial playlist.\u201d I mostly avoided the app; it was just easier to use the wheel\u2019s buttons to control the car. Also, the color selections in the app\u2019s UI are downright atrocious. See for yourself below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTROL\nThe 2018 Odyssey does away with a traditional gear stick (or even a rotational dial) and replaces the shift system with buttons, which makes the car feel even more like a rolling computer. The D / S button takes center stage, and color-coordinated lights around the button indicate which gear has been selected. To avoid accidentally picking reverse, Honda has cleverly designed the button so it works more like a lateral trigger; you have to tug down rather than tap to make that selection.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also liked the built-in Qi wireless charging pad in the middle of the front two seats. It\u2019s only got room to accommodate one device, and you have to avoid putting anything else on it (such as keys or a wallet) to ensure the charge goes through. But as long as your phone or phone case is Qi-compatible, this is a great solution to maintaining battery power without untangling USB cords. Don\u2019t throw away that cord just yet, though: to use Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you still need to plug the phone into the car. \nAbove the cupholder there\u2019s a DVD player under the main control panel, where you can play movies for the TV monitor in the back. The built-in apps should have enough content to keep passengers occupied on a trip. But if you do plan to bring DVDs, just know that only the two front seat passengers can safely change out the disc while the car is moving.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOFTWARE\nAs mentioned before, the infotainment system is based on Android Lollipop, which means Honda is still on its own for a voice-activated assistant. Unfortunately, this means the entire voice experience is absolutely terrible. \nFirst, to activate voice command, you press a button on the right side of the wheel. Standard. Except doing so brings up a screechy chirp sound that startled 100 percent of passengers who took a spin in my Odyssey. (All eight people from test drives jolted out of their seats or audibly yelped upon hearing it.) Honda\u2019s voice assistant is also difficult to use: it sounds robotic and monotone, and would often mishear my commands. With Honda\u2019s Garmin-powered satellite system, a request for an address in Brooklyn brought up a destination in Kansas, which would make sense if there were exact addresses there, too, but the numbers and street names were entirely off \u2014 regardless of which person in the car spoke the command. Even if it heard the correct address, I would have at least expected the Odyssey to use its GPS location to prioritize results closer to my current spot if I didn\u2019t specify a city or state. Other voice commands, such as adjusting the temperature, also contained so many steps that you\u2019re better off just reaching over a few inches and adjusting things manually.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich finally brings us to the Odyssey\u2019s latest tech feature: CabinWatch. (Even the word watch is in the name!) Tapping this allows you to get a look at the second passenger row, or switch to a bird\u2019s-eye view to peek at the third. There\u2019s also an accompanying CabinTalk button, which acts like a PA system, which you can use to talk to backseat riders if they\u2019re using headphones to watch the rear screen. It\u2019s like piloting your own airplane... on land. CabinTalk stops the audio from whatever is playing on the speakers and lets you make your announcement. It only works well when the riders are wearing their Odyssey headphones while watching the backseat TV screen, however; otherwise, the sound echoes, so you\u2019re better off with the OG route: yelling. (Note: the car does not come with enough headphones to accommodate all six backseat passengers.) CabinTalk only has a microphone built into the driver\u2019s seat, so passengers can\u2019t respond back without also yelling. Sorry, kids. You\u2019re only meant to be seen, not heard. \nCabinWatch has infrared night vision, too, but I found that once it automatically swapped to that mode, I never got it to come back out. The camera feed remained purple throughout the rest of the week, regardless of sunlight pouring in from the moon roof, which added to the dystopian effect.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill families find CabinWatch genuinely useful? Ahead of receiving the Odyssey, I read an article about a mother who witnessed her daughter attempting to strangle her infant sister in the rear mirror. If I saw something like that in HD display, I\u2019d probably crash my car. Most of us would hope to never be in that situation, but it feels potentially distracting to literally watch your children\u2019s behavior while you\u2019re driving. Once my passengers got over the screaming, they actually thought it was funny to see themselves on the screen \u2014 but with so many other entertainment features already built into the car, this one feels unintended. For now, the good thing is that the camera doesn\u2019t save any video; even though the car comes with built-in apps, is connected to Wi-Fi on the road, and has a live camera feed, none of the footage goes anywhere, but stays within the Odyssey. With always-watching cameras like Google Clips promising the same local storage, I reckon companies will find it difficult for customers to come around and trust that the device won\u2019t get hacked altogether if it seems like the components to get footages and sounds online are present. Let\u2019s pray that connected cars aren\u2019t the 2018 botnet.\nIn many ways, the 2018 refresh of the Odyssey makes it feel much more like a computer than most cars on the road. But for me, some of the best features aren\u2019t technological at all. They\u2019re things like the Magic Slide configuration that gives you more options for rearranging seats, and the built-in vacuum cleaner in the trunk. If you\u2019re looking to buy this car for your family, my hunch says these will likely be the most valuable features for you, too.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE TAKEAWAYS\nInterior design: The Honda Odyssey has a roomy design with neat middle row configurations, so you can move the seats around to fit longer pieces of furniture or sports equipment, or separate the two middle row passengers, allowing more personal space. Even the last row offered comfortable leg room, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend more than two adults in the back on longer trips.\nMic check: Avoid the built-in voice assistant and opt for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay where you can. (Unless you don\u2019t mind training your ears to ignore the high-pitched chirp when activating the Honda bot.)\nFuel economy: It has an MPG range of 22 miles for combined city and highway mileage, which is comparable to other vehicles of its size, such as the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica and 2018 Ford Explorer.\nPackage deal: If you really want CabinWatch and in-car Wi-Fi, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to the Touring model of the Odyssey, which starts at the MSRP of $44,510. Bumping up to the $46,670 Touring Elite gets you heated and ventilated front seats, the Qi wireless charger in the center console, and an 11-speaker audio system.\nAWD: It\u2019s not offered on this year\u2019s model. Honda claims adding it would \u201ccompromise the interior\u201d by needing to raise the vehicle and cut into the functionality inside the car.\n\n\n"}
