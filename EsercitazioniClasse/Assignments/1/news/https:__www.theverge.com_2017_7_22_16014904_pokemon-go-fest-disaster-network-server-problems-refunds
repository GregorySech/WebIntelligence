But some people have loyally stuck with the hit mobile game months after its popularity waned. Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest was supposed to be a reward and real-world celebration for those players. Unfortunately, for those who traveled to Chicago\u2019s Grant Park to participate and nab the legendary pok\u00e9mon, things got off to a very frustrating start. \nShortly after the event kicked off earlier today, a devastating mix of spotty cellular network reception and server problems prevented attendees from logging in. The game was basically unplayable, which in turn made the elusive pok\u00e9mon that drew people from around the country (and world) unattainable \u2014 at least for now. \n\n\nTrainers, we\u2019re aware of server and connectivity issues impacting #PokemonGOFest and are working as quickly as possible to address them.\u2014 Pok\u00e9mon GO (@PokemonGoApp) July 22, 2017\n\n\n\nAs he attempted to make opening remarks on stage, Niantic CEO John Hanke was met with a chorus of boos and shouting. Fans cried out for his company to restore order and get the game working. There were repeated chants of \u201cWe can\u2019t play!\u201d Niantic has been working to rectify things in the hours since, but has already offered $100 worth of Pok\u00e9coins and a full $20 ticket refund for those who made the trip. \u201cIt\u2019s a small gesture, but we\u2019re sorry,\u201d chief marketing officer Mike Quigley told the crowd \u2014 still to more boos. \u201cThis is not the day that we had all envisioned, but we appreciate your patience.\u201d \n\n\nthe CEO of niantic getting booed on stage at pokemon go fest brings me nothing but joy pic.twitter.com/6WxTAvv76Q\u2014 \uff3a  \uff25  \uff26 (@therealzef) July 22, 2017\n\n\n\nNiantic will also be extending the radius that players must be inside to catch rare pok\u00e9mon to cover two miles outside the park for the next 24 hours. If you\u2019re at Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest, you can expect an email with more specifics soon. \n\u201cI spent more time trying to get the game to load than I have playing it,\u201d said Laura, who was using a phone with AT&T service. But early on, network issues were affecting all four of the major US carriers. \u201cIt was rough in the morning,\u201d said Abbie Harrison, a Verizon customer. \u201cThey're turning off animations for the lures and stuff to make it run better. It's running better now. I'm actually able to log in. It was really spotty and nothing would show up on my screen. I can now actually see and do things.\u201d \nOther players were less bothered and arrived expecting some at least some early inconveniences. \u201cI came in from Montana knowing it was the first one and there would probably be issues and it's about the experience and it will be better next year,\u201d said Marcia Welliever. \u201cI had a stem-cell transplant five years ago and shouldn't be here. Now I catch critters and it keeps me moving and it's giving me my health back. When I got here around 12:15, I couldn't get in at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI've just been patient.\u201d\nThe situation seems to have improved some over the last few hours; The Verge\u2019s Megan Farokhmanesh and Dani Deahl are both on the ground, and you can expect more on the event soon. Niantic is running a live stream, but has chosen not to allow embedding. You can view it here. \n"}
