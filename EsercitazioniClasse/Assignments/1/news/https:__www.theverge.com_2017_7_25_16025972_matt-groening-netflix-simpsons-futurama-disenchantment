{"title": "Matt Groening is making an animated medieval adult fantasy with Netflix", "content": " \nNetflix announced today that Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons and Futurama, will be developing a medieval animated adult fantasy called Disenchantment. It\u2019s scheduled to begin streaming on Netflix in 2018. \nThe series\u2019s protagonist is a young, \u201chard-drinking\u201d princess named Bean (Broad City\u2019s Abbi Jacobson), and her two male companions are a \u201cfeisty elf\u201d named Elfo (Nat Faxon) and a demon named Luci (Eric Andre). While both The Simpsons and Futurama have dynamic, fleshed-out female characters, this is Groening\u2019s first series with a clear female lead. \nRough Draft Studios, the studio that does the art for Futurama, will animate Disenchantment. From the few details Netflix is offering, it\u2019s easy to imagine a sort of epic-fantasy version of Futurama, with the same acerbic, absurdist humor as Groening\u2019s other shows. In the US, Netflix doesn\u2019t have a series that fits this exact bill, though Archer may come closest. (Netflix also carries Futurama, so Disenchantment should fit in.)\n\"The series will bear [Groening\u2019s] trademark animation style and biting wit, and we think it's a perfect fit for our many Netflix animation fans,\" says Cindy Holland, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original content. \nFrom the premise, this series sounds a lot like a myriad of other failed adult animated medieval cartoons like Korgoth of Barbaria or Son of Zorn. But both of Groening\u2019s other major shows have been well-received, long-running successes, so it\u2019s hard to see this one not attracting an audience as well.\n\u201cUltimately,\" Groening says in the press release, \"Disenchantment will be about life and death, love and sex, and how to keep laughing in a world full of suffering and idiots, despite what the elders and wizards and other jerks tell you.\" \nDisenchantment is planned for a 10-episode initial season. \n"}
