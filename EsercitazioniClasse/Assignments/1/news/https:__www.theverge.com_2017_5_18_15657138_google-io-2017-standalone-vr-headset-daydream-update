{"title": "Google isn\u2019t building the ultimate VR headset. It\u2019s setting the foundation for one", "content": " \nWhen word spread in 2016 that Google would move into serious virtual reality, not just disposable cardboard viewers, my colleague Dieter Bohn immediately put a couple of pieces together. One was the need for headsets that could track motion without dedicated \u201cVR rooms\u201d full of cameras or markers. The other was Project Tango, a Google experiment that used an array of cameras to map physical space. Google only announced the more modest Daydream mobile headset that year, but a Tango-powered device seemed inevitable. At I/O 2017, it finally arrived, in the form of a standalone headset that\u2019s supposed to ship later this year.\nGoogle head of VR Clay Bavor describes the new headset as one point on a spectrum called \u201cimmersive computing,\u201d an emerging technological paradigm that \u201cenables our computers to work more like we do.\u201d His team\u2019s been working on this project for two and a half years, and Google is partnering with Qualcomm, HTC, and Lenovo to release a reference design and two commercial products based on it. If this works, Google\u2019s years-long experiments with augmented and virtual reality will have converged into the ideal self-contained VR headset. But the standalone device feels more like a new beginning than a culmination \u2014 and it may be healthier for VR if we treat it that way.\nImmersive computing \u201cenables our computers to work more like we do\u201d\nThe new VR headset uses Google\u2019s Android-based Daydream platform and a system called \u201cWorldSense,\u201d which tracks motion through front-facing edge-detecting cameras. I tried a prototype of the design, and it feels like a solid foundation that could be fine-tuned into something great, if Google can keep to the rest of its promises.\nThe final headsets are supposed to cost about as much as high-end tethered products like the $599 Oculus Rift or $799 HTC Vive, but without the additional cost of a PC. While that\u2019s a lot of money, it\u2019s not drastically more expensive than what people might pay for a gaming console. They\u2019re designed to make VR feel casual and accessible even to people who don\u2019t have Daydream-ready phones, especially people who aren\u2019t interested in Android at all. \u201cIt turns out that a lot of people have iPhones,\u201d Bavor jokes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a rendering system called Seurat \u2014 named after the pointillist painter Georges Seurat \u2014 is supposed to offer image quality that rivals what you\u2019d get on a high-end PC. Andrey Doronichev, Google\u2019s director of product management, describes Seurat as \u201ccomputational magic.\u201d It takes a rendered three-dimensional scene and samples shots of it from many different angles. As seen above, Seurat uses these images to assemble a facade that drastically reduces the number of polygons the headset needs to render, without a visible loss of quality.\nGoogle can also use the same Daydream user interface it\u2019s been fine-tuning for the past year on phones. A software update codenamed Euphrates will add the features you need for devices that users can\u2019t just pop apart and use as a phone, like a full-featured web browser and a dashboard for accessing settings and other non-VR parts of Android.\nGoogle\u2019s headset doesn\u2019t sound like a finished product\nBut for all that, the device Google describes doesn\u2019t feel like a finished product, or a direct competitor to tethered headsets. It feels like an amped-up Daydream. Google\u2019s standalone headset is using the same familiar interface as phone-based Daydream devices. Unfortunately, the standalone headset also imports Daydream\u2019s simple remote, instead of a pair of controllers that can convincingly mimic virtual hands. That means it still can\u2019t run apps like Tilt Brush and Job Simulator \u2014 two beloved VR experiences from Google-owned studios. For now, those will remain restricted to third-party devices like the Rift and Vive. Partners like HTC and Lenovo can\u2019t substitute their own controllers, either, or integrate technology like Leap Motion hand tracking.\nBavor says this will create a consistent standard for developers, and suggests that it might feel different using the remote with inside-out tracking. \u201cObviously things like Tilt Brush won't get translated to an experience like this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we've found is some nice ways of blending [inside-out] head tracking and a [non-tracked] controller.\u201d The change is certainly on his mind: \u201cWe do updates every year, and there'll be future updates\u201d to the hardware, he says. For now, the lack of such a ubiquitous feature will make the headset feel a bit like a hybrid development kit, no matter how polished the rest of it is.\nAnd that seems like exactly what Google wants. An exclusive look at the hardware beforehand, written by Stephen Levy at Backchannel, is an exercise in aggressively resetting the narrative that VR\u2019s arrival is imminent. In a long essay published alongside it, Bavor pushed back against the idea of a \u201ckiller app\u201d that sells everyone on VR, suggesting that seemingly niche applications will slowly grow to have mass appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube, which arguably is Daydream\u2019s killer app right now, feels like another loose end for Google. People can\u2019t move around inside its 360-degree videos, so unlike in the vast majority of VR experiences, the standalone headset\u2019s sophisticated tracking system won\u2019t do much. But Google, which already has a VR video platform called Jump, could change that with cameras that map three-dimensional space as they record it. This is experimental technology, but companies like Lytro are already using versions of it. So is the ultimate goal a YouTube where people will be able to literally walk around inside videos. \u201cMaybe,\u201d Bavor says coyly.\nFor the last few years, companies have all been building toward their first generation of \u201cmass-market\u201d (by virtual reality standards) headsets. Success meant creating something that felt finished and ready to push out to millions of people. Google certainly seems to hope that phone-based Daydream headsets are at that point \u2014 it projects there will be \u201ctens of millions\u201d of Daydream-ready phones by the end of the year.\nBut depending on what HTC and Lenovo unveil, Google\u2019s standalone headset may be more like a bridge between two generations of virtual reality. A lot of pieces are falling into place, but in the process, Google is highlighting the gaps that remain. For now, that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n"}
