{"title": "ScreenDrive: From a \u2018dumb\u2019 Jeep to one with the latest Uconnect system", "content": " \nCars have become expensive, rolling gadgets that are full of screens, speakers, and sensors \u2014 but are they actually good gadgets? In our new series, ScreenDrive, we'll review cars just like any other device, starting with the basics of what they\u2019re like to use.\nI drive a \u201cdumb\u201d Jeep. I bought it in 2007, and I plan to run it into the ground. Impractical temptations elude me, even when surrounded by some of the most amazing and tech-forward cars in the world right here in Silicon Valley. \nThe problem with an old Jeep, though (aside from that whole recall fiasco), is that its Bluetooth connectivity and touchscreen display are a little outdated. Just kidding: it doesn\u2019t have either of these things. It does have an aftermarket Bluetooth stereo that works approximately 60 percent of the time, so there\u2019s that. Also, a CD player! Needless to say, if there\u2019s one thing that might convince me to upgrade, it\u2019s the tech inside the vehicle, not the vehicle itself. \nIn Jeeps, that\u2019s Uconnect, the system developed internally by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. When FCA offered a brand-new Jeep Compass Limited to test-drive, I decided to find out what I was missing out on. Of course it\u2019s an upgrade from your current ride, you might think. But just because a car has new tech in it doesn\u2019t mean that tech is intuitive. I\u2019ve test-driven new vehicles with dashboards so complicated it might as well be a spaceship. (Shakes fist.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUconnect is one of the simpler, intuitive new car systems I\u2019ve tried. In fact, it might almost be too basic, with relatively unsophisticated voice control and limitations around what you can see on its main media screen. But this particular version of Uconnect, available now in several other new FCA cars, is boosted by one big feature: Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Uconnect in the 2017 Jeep Compass now officially supports these, and to no one\u2019s surprise, they improve the in-car experience. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean CarPlay and Android Auto are perfect; they still have their own weird limitations. But they\u2019re at least familiar enough to make navigating your vehicle\u2019s display a whole lot easier while you\u2019re navigating the roads. \nDISPLAYS\nThe Jeep Compass Limited has an 8.4-inch capacitive touchscreen display, which FCA calls its Uconnect 8.4 NAV display. It\u2019s a fine display, but still right in line with what you\u2019d expect from a utility vehicle that is toeing the line of luxury at $30,000. It has a standard resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels; it doesn\u2019t look warped or pixelated, but lacks the brilliance of a modern touchscreen tablet. It doesn\u2019t pop up from the dashboard, there\u2019s no heads-up display on the driver side windshield. It\u2019s just a simple built-in display. You can choose between two color schemes, either red or yellow lettering, against a black background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI asked FCA what kind of processor this version of Uconnect, the fourth generation, is running on, and was told the company does not disclose its suppliers. This is the same response I received when I asked which kernel the custom software was built on, although in the past, it\u2019s been said that it\u2019s QNX. In either case, the screen was responsive during the time that I test-drove the car; I never experienced any issues with the display itself. \nCONTROLS\nThe Uconnect interface makes sense: there\u2019s a row of virtual buttons at the bottom for radio, media, climate, UApps, settings, nav, and phone. Most of these are pretty self-explanatory, and some of them (like radio, media, and temperature) can also be controlled via physical buttons around the steering wheel and dash. Uconnect\u2019s navigation system is rich but not overly complicated. You can view maps in full screen, as 2D maps, or as 3D maps. Added bonus: you can use the touchscreen to zoom in and out on a map. \nOn the downside, I found the main media screen to be mediocre; when I was streaming Spotify over Bluetooth, I had no way to view a playlist or see what song was next. In today\u2019s age of playlist obsession, that just seemed wrong. \nThe Jeep Compass Limited also has built-in voice control, accessible from a shortcut button on the steering wheel. It found me the \u201cnearest gas station\u201d without issue and generally was able to find directions via voice command. Most commands were a two-step process, though. I couldn\u2019t just say \u201cGet me directions to 100 Main Street,\u201d I would have to say \u201cFind address,\u201d then wait for a response, and say the address, etc. \nThat\u2019s not at all uncommon for in-car systems, but that\u2019s the problem: the language requirements feel ridiculously formal compared with phone assistants like Siri and Google Assistant. I also mixed up the one-tap and long-press function sometimes, which means I didn\u2019t know if I was summoning Siri or the car\u2019s built-in voice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, there were a lot of things in Uconnect \u2014 the nav system, the media interface, the voice control \u2014 that worked well, but when compared with the functionality of what you could do if you just had an LTE-equipped iPad or Android tablet in the car, they made less sense. And when you consider that people pay extra money for things like advanced navigation features, you could see why you\u2019d just want to use mobile maps. \nCARPLAY / ANDROID AUTO\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA brief history of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nApple and Google first announced CarPlay and Android Auto, respectively, back in 2014, and while the rollout process has been slow-going (due in part to the production cycles of car manufacturers), the interfaces are now supported more than 150 car models. The big idea with CarPlay and Android Auto is to bring a mobile-friendly, less distracting experience to car dashboards, which sometimes suffer from convoluted interfaces or don\u2019t offer the same media experience as phones and tablets. We\u2019ve reviewed Apple CarPlay and Android Auto before, and in general think they\u2019ll appeal to most smartphone users. But they\u2019re also far from perfect. They can be crashy; they only show proprietary apps when it comes to certain functions, like maps; and in most car models, they still require you to have your phone tethered via USB in the car. In other words, they\u2019re familiar, user-friendly infotainment systems for the near term, but with every carmaker (and tech company) scrambling to be at the forefront of the connected car race, they\u2019re going to have to evolve into something more sophisticated at some point. \n\n\nWhich brings me to Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. In almost every car, the Compass included, you\u2019re required to tether your phone via USB, and then port a distilled version of your smartphone onto your car\u2019s display. The interfaces feel familiar, and a lot of key smartphone apps, with the same colorful app icons, are right there. CarPlay looks like your iPhone screen, but in your car, and simpler, with no option to text or type. Android Auto presents a cascade of information cards that it thinks you want to see: an estimation of the time it takes to get home, your Google Play Music, the local weather. And of course: Android Auto has Google Maps. \nBoth are easy to use. The fact that you can\u2019t use certain apps on certain platforms, like Google Maps or Waze, on Apple CarPlay is annoying. And it takes a little time to get used to the fact that when you open messaging apps, you can only use your voice to respond (a good thing). But this is the closest you can get right now to having that aforementioned tablet in your car, with all the swipes and apps and stuff you already know. I still used Uconnect to adjust safety assistant features, change the car\u2019s temperature, or listen to the radio. Otherwise, I was using Android Auto or CarPlay. \nThere was one Big Glitch: both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto just didn\u2019t work one day. (Naturally, it was the day we had hired a photographer to take photographs of the car\u2019s display.) After lots of troubleshooting and restarting and rebooting and USB cable testing, we determined that it was very likely the USB port that was the root of the issue (the phones weren\u2019t drawing power, either). And the next day, it all worked again, like nothing had happened. Cars!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week, I was sold on the smarter aspects of a new Jeep, but not necessarily Uconnect. I appreciated the Jeep\u2019s fuel efficiency, backup camera and multitude of proximity sensors, its side-mirror warning lights, and its automatic wipers \u2014 all things that are givens in new cars. The Uconnect system was easy enough to get used to and swipe through, even while driving, but Android Auto and Apple\u2019s CarPlay were the biggest selling points. And when you consider that even they are distilled to a fault, that\u2019s saying a lot.\n\n\nThe takeaways\nAesthetic: The Jeep Compass Limited is a surprisingly sleek compact SUV, adopting some of the more polished aesthetics of cars like the Land Rover Discovery Sport and the BMW X3. Leather seats and accent stitching add a touch of class to an otherwise rugged line of cars. \nUser Friendly: No training videos required: the Uconnect 8.4 NAV system has an intuitive layout and easy-to-use navigation tools. Its drawbacks are its weak media functionality and some redundancy across menu options. \nWhat you will really use: Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. \nExtra extra: There\u2019s a dizzying array of safety assistance features, and a lot of them are adjustable by sensitivity (low / med / high) rather than binary on / off functions. \nMic check: Voice assistant will get you what you need, but the multi-step commands make even the most annoying mobile phone assistants seem smart.\nBase price: $28,995 for Jeep Compass Limited; base MSRP overall (non-Limited models) is $20,995.\nPackage deal: An extra $895 will buy you advanced brake assist features, automatic highbeam control, and full-speed forward collision warnings. And for $1,295 extra, you can add a CommandView duel-pane panoramic sunroof.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
