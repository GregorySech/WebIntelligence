{"title": "Google and top Android partners agree to share software patents", "content": " \nGoogle and a group of top Android phone makers have sealed a new agreement to collectively defend themselves against patent lawsuits.\nThe group, which also includes Samsung, LG, and HTC, have agreed to share patents covering \u201cAndroid and Google Applications\u201d on any device that meets Android\u2019s compatibility requirements. The patents will be shared for free, and the group is supposed to be free and open for any company to join.\nThe agreement\u2019s proper name is the \u201cAndroid Networked Cross-License,\u201d but the group is calling it PAX for short. \u201cPax\u201d means \u201cpeace\u201d in Latin, and Google says the agreement is about reaching a legal peace within the tech world.  \n\u201cPatent peace often coincides with innovation.\u201d\n\u201cIn the world of intellectual property, patent peace often coincides with innovation and healthy competition that benefit consumers,\u201d writes Jamie Rosenberg, an Android business VP with Google. \u201cIt is with a hope for such benefits that we are announcing our newest patent licensing initiative focusing on patent peace, which we call PAX.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what types of patents will be shared through this agreement, or what threats these companies hope to defend against. But generally speaking, the agreement ought to help participants defend against patent trolls \u2014 companies that own patents make nothing, and only bring in money through lawsuits \u2014 and potentially even other large tech companies should they get into a standoff over intellectual property. The PAX group writes that they believe signing up \u201cmaterially reduces patent risk.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Google for more information on what the agreement covers.\nThe agreement could be a big win for Samsung and Google. Samsung makes and sells more Android devices than any other company on the list, and this pact makes it a harder target for patent trolls to hit. For Google, this agreement also helps to open the Android ecosystem up to smaller companies that may be interested in making a device but fear litigation. \nWhile this agreement should help to defend Android manufacturers against some lawsuits on its own, its scope is fairly specific and seems to be limited to software. This isn\u2019t the only licensing agreement of its kind, though. Google previously started a group that pledges to only use patents defensively, while another group it co-founded, the LOT Network, prevented companies from buying up patents just to sue others.\n"}
