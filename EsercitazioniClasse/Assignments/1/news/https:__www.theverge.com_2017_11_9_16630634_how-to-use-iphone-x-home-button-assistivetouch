{"title": "How to use a virtual home button instead of the iPhone X\u2019s gestures", "content": " \nI\u2019ve got no problem with the iPhone X\u2019s new home indicator and its swiping gestures. In fact, I quite like them. Swiping up to go home feels like second nature after just a few days using the phone. Same for getting to the app switcher by pausing after that upward swipe. \nBut I\u2019m not a big fan of how far away Control Center feels now. That upper right corner is a stretch for my thumb \u2014 even with my big hands. So yesterday I thought about trying a different method to reach those useful shortcuts, and it\u2019s a trick that has been in iOS for years: it\u2019s called AssistiveTouch. AssistiveTouch is a feature in the accessibility settings (under the \u201cgeneral\u201d section) of iOS that puts a floating, virtual home button on your screen that you can drag wherever you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure the button to perform four different actions based on whether you tap, double tap, 3D Touch, or hold it down. And you can pick your own opacity for the virtual button so that it won\u2019t draw attention or distract from your apps when inactive.  I\u2019ve got a free space for it on my home screen. But if you don\u2019t, it might be tough to find a good spot for the button to live. Also, enabling AssistiveTouch doesn\u2019t turn off or get rid of the swiping gestures; you can switch between them as you please. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve got mine set to act like the old home button whenever it\u2019s tapped once. So if you\u2019re tired of swiping your lock screen up every time you use your phone, you can just tap on the virtual button instead. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s any faster than swiping up on the indicator. It seems about equal, and Face ID works extremely quickly in both cases. \nA double-tap will pull up the multitasking menu \u2014 just like the old home button shortcut. And if I 3D Touch on the virtual button, Control Center appears. I\u2019ve chosen screenshot for the \u201clong press\u201d move, which feels appropriate for the task. You can also configure one of those initial button actions to activate a secondary menu with even more shortcuts. But I think these are all I really need. \nIt\u2019s convenient, but I doubt that I\u2019ll keep the virtual button enabled permanently. Maybe it\u2019ll just be a nice tool if my thumb gets tired of all that swiping from time to time. Apple does a superb job keeping accessibility near the top of its priority list, but it turns out AssistiveTouch is also pretty helpful for the lazy among us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can set the button\u2019s opacity to a point where it blends in with your apps when inactive. \n\n\n"}
