{"title": "HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley underlines the importance of the tech industry bullshit artist", "content": " \nSilicon Valley is Mike Judge and Alec Berg\u2019s biting comedy about the American tech industry, now in its fourth season. Every week, we\u2019ll be taking one idea, scene, or joke and explain how it ties to the real Silicon Valley and speaks to an issue at the heart of the industry and its everlasting goal to change the world \u2014 and make boatloads of money in the process.\nSpoilers ahead for the sixth episode of season 4, \u201cCustomer Support.\u201d\nWhen Silicon Valley creators Mike Judge and Alex Berg set out to satirize the tech industry, they knew they would need a bloviating, self-indulgent moron that would be emblematic of a certain type of Bay Area entrepreneur. \nUnder all the grand mission statements and platitudes about changing the world, the tech industry still runs on cash, and promises of more cash to come. That requires people who are often capable of lying, or even going so far as to believe their own bullshit. That\u2019s why T.J. Miller\u2019s Erlich Bachman has been a fixture on Silicon Valley since day one, despite not having any material impact on Richard\u2019s dreams of building a revolutionary product. From his delusional sense of self to his scummy and exploitative tech incubator to his astounding ability to sell nonsense to smart people with money, Bachman as an idea is as much a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s lifeblood as Apple, Facebook, and Google. \nBachman is the premier bullshit artist of \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019\nIn \u201cCustomer Support,\u201d we get a fresh reminder of why Miller\u2019s character has been so integral to the show\u2019s overarching belief that modern technology is equal parts ambitious and ludicrous. Richard is attempting to build out his idea of a \u201cnew internet\u201d \u2014 effectively a peer-to-peer network built off smartphones \u2014 by selling businesses on a data storage solution that could save them millions. The only problem: like so many of Richard\u2019s dreams, he hasn\u2019t quite been able to realize it yet. The product doesn\u2019t exist, and yet the team still has to try and sell it to get the funds they so desperately need. \nThat\u2019s where Bachman comes in, and more specifically where his particular con man philosophy shines. While Richard spends much of \u201cCustomer Support\u201d keeping Bachman\u2019s sexist and moronic impulses at bay, he still on some level recognizes that the whole exercise really is a game of make-believe. He has to convince businesses that his compression algorithm can function the way he thinks it can, without any research or even experience to support the claim. In other words, he has to bullshit. (Bachman\u2019s skills are even further highlighted later in the episode, when he convinces Palmer Luckey-like virtual reality whiz kid Keenan Feldspar to choose Laurie and Monica as potential investors.)\nThis type of scenario has played out countless times in the real tech industry, where either out of a good faith, hidden desperation, or blind hope, someone sells a room of intelligent people on an idea that isn\u2019t quite there yet. There\u2019s the numerous now-defunct startups that promised to simplify our lives with \u201call-in-one\u201d credit cards that didn\u2019t work all that well. Better yet, remember mobile payments nightmare Clinkle that ended up crashing and burning in an attempt to invent a new way to pay with your phone? \nEven products that functioned as intended, like social networks and chat apps, vacuumed up millions in VC funding only to fail at maintaining the meteoric growth necessary to survive as free software in the App Store. (See: Airtime, Formspring, Meerkat, Secret, Yik Yak.)\nWhere does \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 go without Bachman?\nWhat\u2019s so interesting about this particular plot point on Silicon Valley is that it happens to dovetail neatly with some intriguing real-life news: Miller won\u2019t be returning for the renewed season 5 of Silicon Valley. HBO described the departure as a \u201cmutual agreement,\u201d and many speculate Miller is just gearing up for a more serious movie career given his new comedy special and a string of voice acting gigs in big-name productions. \nYet it still raises an interesting question about the future of the show. I\u2019m sure Judge, Berg, and their writers will concoct an excellent and fitting departure for Bachman in the season 5 premiere, in the same way they deftly handled the death of actor Christopher Evan Welch, who played VC Peter Gregory. But what\u2019s a bit of satire on the bullshit in Silicon Valley without its premier bullshit artist?\nPerhaps Bighead\u2019s newfound skills pretending to be a Stanford CS professor will have prepared him to inherit the mantle? Or maybe Gilfoyle, with his empathy-devoid deadpan personality, will step up to be the anti-Bachman \u2014 the fresh dose of no-bullshit attitude the Pied Piper crew needs to finally break through. Because I think we can all agree that while Dinesh played the part well, he didn\u2019t have what it takes to bullshit his way to the top. \n\n"}
