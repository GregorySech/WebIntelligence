{"title": "Summer 2019 will be a showdown for Hollywood's biggest franchises", "content": " \nYesterday, Disney announced that it was shuffling its release schedule to move Star Wars: Episode IX \u2014 the last film in the main \u201csequel trilogy\u201d \u2014 from December 2019 up to May 24th, 2019. \nNow, at first glance, this is pretty pedestrian news. Films get moved around all the time, whether that\u2019s due to trying to avoid competitors, taking more time on editing or special effects, or just the realities of Hollywood politics. But this particular move is somewhat strange. \nAfter all, between The Force Awakens and Rogue One, Disney and Lucasfilm have already shown that Star Wars films can break box office records in December, far away from the traditional summer movie season where genre films like these have tended to thrive in the past. The only other major sci-fi franchise that seemed to be gunning for the December release \u2014 James Cameron\u2019s long-gestating Avatar sequels \u2014 was delayed again until 2020 days before Disney\u2019s announcement, leaving December 2019 seemingly wide open for another Star Wars box office sweep. The only other major movie that has actually been announced for that month is the Wicked movie adaptation, which, even assuming that project doesn\u2019t get delayed again, doesn\u2019t seem to pose that much of a threat to Star Wars\u2019 traditional sci-fi audience in the same way that Avatar might. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best theory I can come up with to remotely explain the move is that Disney and Lucasfilm are clearing December out for a second as-yet-unannounced Star Wars movie. Marvel has already proved to executives at the House of Mouse that multiple franchise entries in a cinematic universe can still draw audience with two superhero films per year since 2013, a success it looks to build on by upping that rate to three going forward. And what better way to continue to keep fans excited for new Star Wars stories after the conclusion to the current batch of \u201cEpisode\u201d entries than by launching whatever comes next? \nTwo of Disney\u2019s biggest films, possibly ever, are now stepping on each other\u2019s toes\nBecause if there\u2019s little reason to move Episode IX from where it was, the specific choice of May 2019 is even more confusing. Looking at the schedule, the fourth (currently untitled) Avengers movie \u2014 the one that\u2019s expected to serve as a conclusion to the roughly 22-film story arc of the Infinity Stones that has comprised Marvel\u2019s movie franchise so far \u2014 is set to come out just three weeks before Star Wars: Episode IX now. Two of Disney\u2019s biggest films, possibly ever, are now stepping on each other\u2019s toes. \nBut things get even more crowded for Disney in 2019. It\u2019s not just Star Wars and Marvel releasing their biggest, arc-ending films in the span of a month. Because less than a month after Star Wars hits, Disney is releasing Toy Story 4 on June 21st, a sequel to Toy Story 3, which remains the single most lucrative Pixar film ever released. But you\u2019ll have no time to catch your breath after that, because Disney wants you back in theaters on July 5th for a Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel, and then back again on July 19th for the live action The Lion King remake \u2014 which, if the live action Beauty and the Beast and Jungle Book movies are anything to go by, will likely also be an insanely lucrative hit. Oh wait, I forget Captain Marvel \u2014 Marvel\u2019s first female character-led film \u2014 which starts things off in March. And if that wasn\u2019t quite enough, the company also has Frozen 2 \u2014 you remember Frozen, right? Biggest animated movie of all time? \u2014 coming out at the end of November. And that\u2019s not counting a couple of other spots on the calendar that Disney has staked out but has yet to announce a film for. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n2016 was Disney\u2019s year at the movies, whether you like it or not\n\nLast year, I wrote about how Disney\u2019s box office strategy can be exemplified by its success in five brands: Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney Animation Studios, and live-action remakes of its classic films. But if that was true in 2016 with films like Rogue One, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, Zootopia, and The Jungle Book, 2019 is set to magnify the same strategy by releasing what could be the biggest possible film in each of those brands \u2014 most of them within a few weeks. That\u2019s a frightening schedule if you work at a major film studio that isn\u2019t Disney.\nDisney isn\u2019t the only one going full-tilt in 2019\nAnd yet Disney isn\u2019t the only one going full-tilt in 2019. It seems that some madness has taken hold of the entire movie-making industry. I encourage you to peruse the full list, because it\u2019s looking more and more like this will be the make-it-or-break-it year for our current cinematic marketplace of franchises and universes. To quickly break it down, here are some of the highlights: \nWarner Bros has The Lego Movie Sequel in February, Godzilla: King of the Monsters in March, DC\u2019s Shazam! for April 5th, two still unannounced DC movies on June 14th and November 1st, and a Minecraft movie set for May 24th (which will have to go head-to-head with Star Wars now).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal? Fast and Furious 9, which hits on April 19th (just before Disney\u2019s May onslaught), an entry in the Universal Monsters universe that the studio is trying to launch with Tom Cruise\u2019s The Mummy for February 15th, How to Train Your Dragon 3 for March 1st, a Robert Downey Jr.-starring Doctor Dolitte remake for May 24th (again, good luck with Star Wars there), The Secret Life of Pets 2 on July 3rd, and the aforementioned Wicked adaptation in December. \nParamount doesn't have as much on its docket yet, but what it does have \u2014 Transformers 6 on June 28th and The SpongeBob Movie 3 \u2014 both are major entries in popular franchises as well. \n2019 could be a moment for Disney and the entire film industry\nNow, obviously, 2019 is still incredibly far away. It\u2019s virtually guaranteed that some \u2014 if not many \u2014 of these plans will get changed and films will be shifted around or canned entirely. But with what we have so far, it\u2019s looking increasingly like the year is going to be a culmination of a moment, both for Disney specifically with its focus on building its individual properties up, and the entire motion picture industry in general, which seems to be committing full-force to franchises. \nWhat happens when there\u2019s the Fast and Furious, Star Wars, The Avengers, Transformers, DC, a Pixar movie, and Minecraft all vying for audiences at the same time? Can the movie industry sustain this many franchises? And where does major commercial cinema go from here?\nI don\u2019t have the answer to most of these questions. But one thing is for certain: the moviegoing world of 2020 will look very different in the aftermath. \n\n"}
