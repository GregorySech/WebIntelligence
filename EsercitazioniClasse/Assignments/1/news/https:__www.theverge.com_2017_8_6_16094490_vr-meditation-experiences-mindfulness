{"title": "VR\u2019s answer to relaxation? Meditation experiences", "content": " \nMindfulness has become a flourishing industry, worth some $1 billion, and now, a New York production company called m ss ng p eces (the spaces are deliberate) has launched VR meditation experiences, including one that puts users straight into a guided session, reports Fast Company.\nThe experience was produced by the company, along with Jack Kornfield, the founder of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Northern California. Ari Kushnir, m ss ng p eces\u2019 founder, was a fan of Kornfield\u2019s podcast and worked with him to put together a 360-degree video for YouTube, the Daydream, and on YouTube\u2019s VR headset feature. \n\u201cVR really is the future\u2013it will become widespread as a way for people to experience something they didn\u2019t know before,\u201d Kornfield told Fast Company. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly beautiful way to capture what it means to be on a retreat or to come to a meditation center. For a lot of people, those experiences are quite foreign\u2013they may think that it\u2019s out of their comfort zone, or not for them.\u201d\n\nThe experiences include meditation talks, a \u201cnature meditation in the hills of Marin County,\u201d and a walking meditation (though the user is advised to sit in the headset). \n\u201cHopefully it inspires more creators to explore the interesting tension, which is that we have such amazing technology, but it\u2019s making us miserable,\u201d said Ivan Cash, a contributing creative director at m ss ng p eces. \u201cWe want to keep figuring out how to make the right kinds of content and resources to support people being happy and fulfilled, and holistically in a better place.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time mindfulness and technology have crossed paths, with countless smartphone apps designed to help users relax already available. Earlier this year, The Verge\u2019s Lauren Goode found that her Apple AirPods were the perfect accessory to meditation apps.\nTechnology \u2014 simultaneously the stressor and de-stressor of our lives.\n\n"}
