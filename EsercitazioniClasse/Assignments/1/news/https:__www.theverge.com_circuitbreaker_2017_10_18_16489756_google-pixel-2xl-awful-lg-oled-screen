{"title": "The Pixel 2 XL would be the best phone in the world if its screen wasn\u2019t so weird", "content": " \nFirst thing\u2019s first: if you want to read The Verge\u2019s canonical opinion on Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 phones, read Dieter Bohn\u2019s authoritative and comprehensive review. Dieter\u2019s judgment is something I rarely question, but on this one occasion, he and I diverge on how we feel about a very important aspect of Google\u2019s new flagship pair. Dieter thinks the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s screen is imperfect but can be lived with; I think it\u2019s an inexcusable disaster.\nI have been using the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL for nearly a week now, and in that time I\u2019ve immersed myself in the goodness that is Android 8.0, Google\u2019s pleasantly updated design, and the unprecedented and unequaled Pixel camera. I\u2019m a satisfied Android user, and I know for a fact (because I\u2019ve reviewed every other major flagship out there) that no other Android device can bring me as close to mobile nirvana and contentment as these new Pixels do. But for the majority of this week, I\u2019ve opted to use the smaller Pixel 2, owing to just how poor the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s screen is.\nThis situation upsets me because the 2 XL has numerous desirable advantages over the 2: much smaller bezels, a larger battery that lasts longer, and just a bigger canvas on which I can pen my letter of complaint to LG Display, the maker of the offending screen in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\nLook at that New York Times icon in the image above. Stop flinching and really look at it, soak in the kaleidoscope of colors washing over it. Just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, I\u2019m seeing a haze of green in the middle of the gothic \u201cT\u201d, which then blooms into a red that eventually transitions into the white that the icon is supposed to be. But the fun isn\u2019t over; when you get up real close, you\u2019ll see the edges of the icon are all fringed by a sort of purply-red and, again, green. The neighboring heart icon, which is also supposed to be white, presents us with a crosshatch of red and green and white micropixels.\nDoes that look like 2017 to you?\nAt this point, still dripping with anticipation for the really great Google phone you\u2019d preordered, you might be straying into denial territory and telling yourself that this is not the sort of issue you\u2019d notice. But not noticing a thing isn\u2019t the same as not sensing it. Your eyes will pick up on these flaws and you, like me, will start to grow annoyed looking at this screen without even knowing why. Well, the above is part of why.\nAnother big chunk of the \u201cwhy\u201d is in the blue cast that befalls the screen if you ever hold it at an angle that\u2019s less than perfectly in front of you. You\u2019ll know this issue from the year 2011, when Samsung was just getting started with its mobile OLED technology and phones like the Galaxy S II looked gorgeous up front but had the weakness of looking blue from almost any oblique angle. The OLED panel on Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t even have the decency to look stunning when viewed under perfect circumstances. But it does have that aggravating blue cast that we thought we\u2019d left in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame image displayed on an iPhone 8 Plus (left) and Pixel 2 XL (right). The iPhone makes the photo look brighter than it actually is, and the 2 XL doesn\u2019t look quite so green to the naked eye. Still, this comparison illustrates just how different the 2 XL is from the conventional color tuning. Photos by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of the color accuracy and saturation of the 2 XL. Here\u2019s Google\u2019s position on the matter:\n\"We designed the Pixel display to have a more natural and accurate rendition of colors this year but we know some people prefer more vivid colors so we've added an option to boost colors by 10% for a more saturated display. We're always looking at people's responses to Pixel and we will look at adding more color options through a software update if we see a lot of feedback.\"\nThe Verge\u2019s Creative Director James Bareham sides with Google on this, describing the Pixel 2 XL as the phone screen tuned most closely to professional displays: \u201cit presents natural colors in terms of photos, but is a little dark,\u201d he says. But here\u2019s the real problem: James uses truly pro equipment that nobody is trying to sell to consumers; what he thinks of as accurate, what might technically be accurate, is not what the majority of us see on most of the devices we use.\nJust a quick look at the red elements of the Google Photos and Chrome icons on the Android home screen \u2014 both of which look brown on the Pixel 2 XL \u2014 tells me I\u2019m not going to like where this weird screen is going. Google\u2019s \u201cvivid colors\u201d display setting doesn\u2019t do enough to bring the 2 XL back in line with the mobile, laptop, and desktop displays that we\u2019re all used to. Even with it activated, everything looks washed out and feeble when set against an iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, HTC U11, MacBook Pro, iMac, or the majority of Windows laptops. There is a reasonably consistent mainstream flavor of color balance and saturation, and the 2 XL is simply too far out of it.\nI took a selfie with the Pixel 2 XL and it was a good sharp selfie, worthy of being shared. That Pixel camera really is a marvel to behold. But looking at the image on the 2 XL\u2019s screen, my face looked vampiric, deprived of color and vibrance. I popped that same photo up on my iMac and, hey presto, there was pinkness in my cheeks again. I have also photographed cats, cars, architecture, and nighttime scenes, and in each case, looking at them on the 2 XL made me want to edit some saturation in and modify the color balance. That\u2019s dangerous and misleading \u2014 because on more conventionally tuned displays, all of those photos look near enough perfect. The 2 XL screen is actively nudging its users into making photo edits they\u2019ll later regret.\nYet another issue with the Pixel 2 XL screen has been pointed out by Ars Technica and Android Central. Both describe a gritty or grainy appearance to single-color backgrounds in low light on the 2 XL. The photos provided by Ars illustrate this well, showing an inconsistent, \u201cdirty\u201d white where it should be simply uniform; this grittiness becomes even more apparent when you scroll.\nFrom my time with the excellent Pixel 2, I firmly believe that the Pixel 2 XL would be the best phone on the market \u2014 without exception \u2014 if it just had the sort of adequate screen that the Pixel XL of yesteryear had. (I\u2019m not even reaching for Samsung Galaxy S8 class greatness, see how modest the bar to cross is!) Maybe you disagree with me and you consider the questionable display in question to be fine. But the reason for my melodramatic angst is just how close Google came to true greatness \u2014 there\u2019s so much good contained within the company\u2019s 2017 phones. Is perfection too much to ask for?\nThere are many phone features that I\u2019m willing to compromise on. Wireless charging and waterproofing are things everyone insists on these days, but I don\u2019t. I spent a very happy month and a half toting a U11 with big fat bezels on it, because I think it\u2019s a gorgeous device. Expandable storage, removable batteries, even headphone jacks are not big enough omissions to put me off a phone that\u2019s really great in some other respect. But a screen that makes me scream every time I have to look at it? I couldn\u2019t tolerate that with the LG V30, and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it with the $850 Google Pixel 2 XL, either.\n"}
