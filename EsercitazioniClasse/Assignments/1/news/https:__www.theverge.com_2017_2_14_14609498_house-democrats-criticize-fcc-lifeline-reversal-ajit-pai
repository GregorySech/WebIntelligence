{"title": "41 House Democrats criticize FCC for limiting low-income broadband subsidies", "content": " \nDemocrats in Congress are questioning the new FCC chief over his decision to slow the expansion of broadband subsidies for low-income households.\nIn a letter sent this morning, 41 House Democrats write that the commission\u2019s actions have the effect of \u201creducing, not expanding, internet access\u201d and \u201cwill hurt those in our country that need the most help.\u201d\nIn his second week on the job, new FCC chairman Ajit Pai reversed a decision by his predecessor that would have allowed nine additional internet providers to offer subsidized broadband access to households near or below the poverty line.\nExpanding Lifeline is critical to the program\u2019s success\nPai also indicated that he has no intention of expanding broadband subsidies until he alters the program, called Lifeline, to deal with \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d He\u2019s previously claimed these issues lead to a loss of around $476 million a year, though he\u2019s also said that he does not yet have evidence for this.\nExisting Lifeline providers \u2014 of which there are currently over 900 \u2014 are still able to offer subsidies on phone or internet service. But expanding the program to additional internet providers is critical to its success.\n\n\n1) Today I sent a letter to @AjitPaiFCC signed by 40 of my colleagues. We must expand, not reduce, Internet access. pic.twitter.com/2MeQtVxCLd\u2014 Rep.

And while the program\u2019s $9.25-per-month discount might get you somewhere on landline telephone service, it isn\u2019t hugely meaningful when it comes to broadband \u2014 having competition between Lifeline providers is a key part of keeping down costs for families that need it.\nAfter being criticized for the decision last week, Pai wrote a blog post arguing that his decision wouldn\u2019t have a big impact, since he was only removing nine Lifeline providers, and that the issue was being \u201csensationalized\u201d by the media. Pai also noted that the nine providers that had their Lifeline status reversed could still receive approval at a later date.\nStill, all indications point to Pai halting the expansion of Lifeline until he can alter the program. And when he does, it\u2019ll be important to see whether those changes make it harder for eligible households to get subsidies; though he\u2019s made no proposal yet, criticizing unproven fraud is often a cover for disenfranchisement.\nThe House Democrats writing Pai ask that he \u201creconsider the commission\u2019s decision to remove the nine companies.\u201d An FCC spokesperson said the commission is reviewing the letter.\nUpdate February 14th, 12:40PM ET: This story has been updated with comment from the FCC.\n"}
