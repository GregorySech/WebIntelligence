{"title": "Late Shift is another step toward the merging of movies and video games", "content": " Moviegoing etiquette dictates that any cellphone use in a theater is bad form, but the film Late Shift challenges that dynamic. Viewers aren\u2019t just encouraged to use their phones, they\u2019re almost required to if they want to see the story progress. Late Shift, which has been making the rounds in select screenings since 2016, is an interactive film. The movie follows Matt  Joe Sowerbutts , a student coerced into joining an auction-house heist in London. Unlike a regular theatergoing experience, Late Shift progresses according to audience participation. It uses an app to guide viewers through the experience. Options to pursue a specific conversation or action pop up throughout, prompting viewers to pick up their phones and vote. The whole thing is timed; if audiences are too slow, or if no one votes, the film continues on a set storyline, aka the film\u2019s \u201cdirector\u2019s cut.\u201d Although much of the film is about Matt becoming more and more entangled in the scheme, Late Shift includes seven different endings, and more than 100 choices that can lead to any one of them. For most moviegoers, Late Shift is an unusual experience. Interactive movies have been tried in a variety of forms, but they\u2019ve never taken off in a significant way. But for anyone who\u2019s ever played a video game, the model should seem much more familiar. Late Shift Producer Chady Eli Mattar calls it the gamification of films \u2014 a phrase some people scoff at. \u201cSometimes people hear \u2018the gamification of films\u2019 and they react, \u2018Eh come on,\u2019\u201d he says, \u201cbecause film always feels it's superior, in terms of entertainment.\u201d Mattar has trouble drawing a line between the two media. Games that use video in place of animated graphics, otherwise known as FMV games, have been around since the early 1980s, and have enjoyed a brief resurgence in recent years with games like Her Story. Mattar himself points to studios like Telltale Games, which are working on narrative-driven experiences he calls advanced and engaging. \u201cAnd then you look at something like [Late Shift] \u2014 it's an incredible game,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to say you're playing this because there is a gamification to it. I don't know if that's bad or good, but I think it's exciting, and why not?\u201d\u201ceverybody has a cellphone.\u201dIt may be easy to confuse Late Shift with an FMV game, but Mattar insists on its status as a film, one that\u2019s perfect for enjoying in a theater setting. It\u2019s typical action fanfare \u2014 heists, shootouts, makeout scenes \u2014 built on top of multiple endings. Its sharp-tongued hero may get the girl, or not, depending on what audiences do; he might save the day, or wind up dead. It doesn\u2019t have a very original story to tell, but the fun is the social experience. During my screening, tense scenes dissolved amid audience laughter as everyone voted for the most troll-ish options available. Instead of letting Matt flawlessly romance the female lead, the audience voted for him to be kind of a dick. It\u2019s a simple way to keep the entire audience engaged, regardless of their age or experience. \"Everybody has a cellphone,\u201d Mattar says. \u201cWhat can we do with a cellphone that lets you play with the story?\u201dMattar doesn\u2019t believe interactive films are about to take over the industry, but he believes there\u2019s a lot of potential in the format. And people who don\u2019t want to make tough choices can just follow along on their own by downloading the film, or rewatching specific scenes to see how things could have gone differently. \u201cI think that the beauty of this, and the beauty of any technology, is that you make a choice of what you want to do with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this is going to help people keep being creative, make films, keep more directors and writers creative and energized, feeling their movies are still a communal experience, their movies are still being consumed collectively, that's nice. Why not?\u201d "}
