{"title": "Dropbox offers a new plan that lets you sync and share work from one spot", "content": " \nDropbox launched a new plan today called Dropbox Professional for individuals that lets you store, access, and track files from one place. The plan opens up Dropbox\u2019s business feature Smart Sync to individuals for the first time. Smart Sync lets you save space by storing files only in the cloud, without any hard drive backup, and it\u2019s compatible with Mac and Windows.\nThe company also announced a new feature called Dropbox Showcase, which lets you create a PowerPoint-like introduction to the documents you\u2019re sharing, to give more context to shared links. You can add a logo and custom layouts. Showcase also tells you who\u2019s viewed your link so far, and Professional gets you a detailed viewer history of the past 120 days with time and dates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDropbox Professional costs either $199 a year, or $19.99 a month, and it comes with 1TB of storage space. The company is targeting entrepreneurs and those who are self-employed, but it will have an uphill battle given that Box.com offers something similar, minus the premium features, for only $15 a month per user.\n"}
