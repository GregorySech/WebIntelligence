 Halloween may have ended just a few short hours ago, but November is here now. Despite the fact that the day isn’t for another 24 days, Dell is officially kicking things off this season with its first set of Black Friday deals. (We’re at the point where I’m mostly just grateful that I didn’t have to write this in October.)Dell’s doing things a little differently this year: for the next 48 hours, the company will be offering early access to some of its Black Friday deals, running until November 3rd at 7AM ET. We’ll be updating this post as we find which deals are available now, so check back often if you’re looking to score an early discount. If you miss those deals, they’ll be back along with the rest of Dell’s Black Friday deals, which are running from November 15th through the 24th.While Dell is obviously a good place to get, you know, Dell products, the company’s online store is also a pretty good place to pick up gear from other companies, including TVs, gaming consoles, and other gadgets. Some of the highlights include $100 off DJI’s Spark drone, the JBL Chage 3 (our favorite Bluetooth speaker) for $89.99, and a bunch of discounted TVs that come with extra Dell gift cards. We’ve sifted through the onrush of sales to bring you, our faithful readers, only the finest hand-picked deals, which we’ve listed below. The full list of Dell’s various offerings can be found at the company’s Black Friday hub here.
