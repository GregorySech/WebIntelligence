{"title": "Snapchat is launching a reality show where exes try to figure out why they broke up", "content": " \nSnapchat is partnering with A&E to launch its first original reality show called Second Chance, TechCrunch reports. The show will bring together \u201cemotional exes\u201d to talk about why their relationship ended, and either get closure or just end up feeling worse. Going on this show sounds like the exact opposite of what a good friend would tell you to do after a breakup. \nThe eight-week series is just the first of several that Snapchat plans to make in collaboration with A&E, and the most recent of Snapchat\u2019s original series. Back in 2015, Snapchat premiered its first original scripted series called Literally Can\u2019t Even. It has since partnered with ABC for a Bachelor recap show, and just last week the BBC announced that it was bringing six episodes of Planet Earth II exclusively to Snapchat. \nSecond Chance, which doesn\u2019t have a set premiere date yet, will air in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. \n\n"}
