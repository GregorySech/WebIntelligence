{"title": "The Eta Clock tells you where your family members are, just like in Harry Potter", "content": " \nThe Eta Clock is a new Kickstarter project from a startup called DC Creatives that works with a smartphone app to show you the locations of your friends and family members, using a fun, clock-style interface. \nSo basically, it\u2019s a real, functional version of the Weasley family\u2019s magical clock from the Harry Potter series. And \u2014 putting aside the fraught social issues of needing to know your family member\u2019s locations \u2014 it\u2019s kind of amazing that it exists. While it\u2019s worth pointing out that the Eta Clock is by no means the first to emulate the Weasley family\u2019s tracking timepiece, it is (to the best of my knowledge) the first product that is ostensibly being sold to consumers. (Unless the Kickstarter crashes and burns, that is.)\nUnlike Mrs. Weasley\u2019s version, the Eta Clock relies on modern technology rather than actual sorcery to accomplish the job. Using a companion app, each user can set specific locations on their phone corresponding to places like \u201cwork,\u201d \u201cgym,\u201d or \u201cschool,\u201d along with more general categories like \u201cabroad\u201d (when someone is outside their home country), \u201ctransit\u201d (if the individual is traveling faster than three miles per hour), or \u201clost\u201d (if the person\u2019s phone hasn\u2019t updated location in more than five days). \n\nthere\u2019s no actual way to tell time with it\nThere are, of course, some privacy concerns with the Eta Clock, which works by broadcasting your location to the company\u2019s server, which then relays it to your clock. DC Creatives says that it will immediately delete data as soon as it\u2019s sent to your Eta Clock, however. Additionally, users will be able to control to what extent they share their location, which should help alleviate some of the concerns about being tracked.\nThere is one other quibble I have with the Eta Clock: much like its magical counterpart from J.K. Rowling\u2019s books, it doesn\u2019t seem capable of telling you the time. \nThe ETA Clock is available to back on Kickstarter for an early-bird price of $350, which DC Creatives claims is a $150 savings off the intended retail price of $500. The company hopes to ship the finished products in July 2018, which is something to note as a possible concern given how far away that ship date is, along with the company\u2019s relatively unfounded experience when it comes to shipping hardware products. As is always the case with crowdfunded gadgets, use your best judgement before backing.  \n"}
