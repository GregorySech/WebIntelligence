{"title": "The Wet Hot American Summer tabletop game is D&D; for comedy nerds", "content": " \nWet Hot American Summer Fantasy Camp is the first officially licensed game based on the comedy-film-turned-Netflix-series about the kids and councilors at a raunchy summer camp. The tabletop game, which features caricatures of the film\u2019s many stars \u2014 including Amy Poehler, Janeane Garofalo, and the unaging Paul Rudd \u2014 is a bit more complicated than what you\u2019ll find in your parents\u2019 board game closet.\nThe game is a fantasy role-playing tabletop game for three to five players, a la Dungeons & Dragons. You can choose from favorite established characters (ahem, Andy) at Camp Firewood, or make up a lovable new dweeb and a brand-new camp. It also includes new material from Wet Hot American Summer writer and director David Wain, and cast members Joe Lo Truglio, Marguerite Moreau, and Michael Ian Black.\nIt\u2019s meant to be a little easier on tabletop newcomers. The game promises \u201cless math than traditional RPGs and more emphasis on storytelling and party game craziness,\u201d which equates to more camp-like activities and less monster fighting. Humor-based press The Devastator is releasing the game, but fans can back the project on Kickstarter now. The campaign ends on May 18th, and early copies are scheduled to begin shipping in August.\n"}
