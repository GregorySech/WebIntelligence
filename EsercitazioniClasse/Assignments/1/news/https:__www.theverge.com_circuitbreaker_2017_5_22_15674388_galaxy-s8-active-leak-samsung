{"title": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 Active looks like a rugged LG G6", "content": " \nIt\u2019s getting close to the time of year when Samsung usually introduces a rugged version of its latest Galaxy S smartphone. And a new leak from the Wireless Power Consortium reveals a lot about what the S8 Active is going to look like.\nIt\u2019s only a single photo, but the image lets us know three key things about the S8 Active. First, the display: the S8 Active won\u2019t have curved edges, like the regular S8.\nThe S8 Active has some serious corners\nThe big question this year was what Samsung planned to do about the screen, since curved glass may be more susceptible to cracking, and Samsung seems to have decided the best option was to get rid of it altogether. Instead, the S8 Active has a flattened out look but retains the S8\u2019s rounded corners, making the front of the phone look a lot like LG\u2019s G6.\nSamsung seems to have made the bezels a little bit larger on the S8 Active, particularly on the sides. But overall, the front of the phone still seems to get fairly close to the nearly all-screen look of actual S8.\nThe second thing this photo shows is that Samsung isn\u2019t putting buttons back on the front of the phone. That\u2019s not necessarily a huge surprise, but it\u2019ll make the device a bit harder to handle when wet, since owners will be relying on the touchscreen.\nAnd finally, this photo reveals a bit of what Samsung is doing to make the phone rugged. All four of its corners bump out, suggesting they\u2019ve been reinforced to absorb shock should the phone get dropped; it looks a lot like what Samsung has done in the past. We still don\u2019t know exactly how bulky the Active model will look, but recent models have avoided feeling chunky \u2014 they\u2019re just not noticeably thin like the main model.\nOne other thing we don\u2019t know: if Samsung will put camo on the back of this thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\n\nSamsung\u2019s Active phones usually include bigger batteries, shatter-resistant screens, and dust- and water-proofing. They\u2019re also usually exclusive to AT&T and announced in June, so we should hear more soon.\n"}
