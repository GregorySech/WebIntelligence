{"title": "Pix2Pix is another good web tool for making horrifying autofill images", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s open-source machine learning project Tensorflow is probably used all the time for helpful things that advance the cause of mankind or something. But in my experience, what it has been best used for is making horrifying auto-generated images out of simple line drawings. I\u2019m referring to edges2cats, which turned any line drawing into a cat. It was a whole thing! Everyone was trying it out, then posting pictures of really demented cats to Twitter for others to laugh at. \nToday the same thing has happened, except it\u2019s not cats. It\u2019s human heads. And instead of Google\u2019s project, Dutch Public Broadcaster NPO created its own artificial intelligence system that had only been fed thousands of images of one of its anchors, Lara Rense. As reported by the popular Tumblr prostheticknowledge, the web tool is called Pix2Pix. \nYou draw a face, and Pix2Pix uses a neural network to create what looks like an approximation of an oil painting of that face (made up of pieces of Rense\u2019s face). Obviously the results mostly look like monsters, especially the pig-baby monster from the first season of American Horror Story.

For example, this is a total disaster, by me: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another total disaster, by The Verge news editor Kwame Opam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy editor Chris Plante drew a portrait of my robot son Klav, who you might remember from a joke from nearly a year ago, but I don\u2019t know how loyal you are to this website: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlav.\nPhoto: Chris Plante\n\n\nOur social media manager and resident cartoonist Dami Lee made the guy from Pan\u2019s Labyrinth: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, have fun! You can read more about the project on the radio station\u2019s website, but the Google translation of the Dutch is kind of rough. \n"}
