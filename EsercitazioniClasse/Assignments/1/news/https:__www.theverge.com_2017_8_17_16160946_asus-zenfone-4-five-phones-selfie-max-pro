{"title": "Asus Zenfone 4 offers dual cameras on five phones, including one that takes 4K selfie videos", "content": " \nAsus has revealed new phones from its Zenfone 4 line: the ZenFone 4, ZenFone Max, ZenFone 4 Max Pro, ZenFone 4 Selfie, and ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro. Whew, that\u2019s a mouthful! The models and specs were leaked last week on the Taiwanese company\u2019s French website. The ZenFone 4 and ZenFone 4 Max feature rear dual cameras (which seem to be all the rage this year), while the Selfie models have front dual cameras, which capture photos with a 120-degree angle.\nThe differences between the phones vary based on what you would prefer to use them for. The Selfie models were (obviously) made with taking photos of your face in mind, so the front camera has a huge 20MP or 24MP camera (regular and pro models, respectively). The Selfie Pro version can take 4K resolution videos from the front-facing shooter as well, and comes in your choice of four candy-colored models.\nThe ZenFone Max, meanwhile, boasts huge battery life, with Asus claiming 37.6 hours of 3G talk time and 32.5 hours of Wi-Fi browsing on a single charge. The ZenFone Max\u2019s battery has a 5,000mAh power capacity, and also works as a power bank to charge your other devices. Lastly, the ZenFone 4 and ZenFone 4 Max Pro are being sold for their photography abilities with 12MP and 16MP dual rear cameras, respectively. The Max Pro model is also catered more to those on the go, as it also features a 5,000mAH battery. All four will arrive with Android 7.1.1 Nougat and start at $279 for the Selfie models and $399 for the flagship.\n\n"}
