{"title": "Seagate\u2019s new 8TB Game Drive Hub for Xbox One is a storage beast", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been a month of gaming announcements for Microsoft with Game Pass, its new Xbox One game subscription service, and its newest (and smallest) games console, Xbox One X. Though the Xbox One X comes with a 1TB hard drive, the forthcoming slate of new titles plus Game Pass\u2019 current allowance for direct downloads from a catalog of 100+ Xbox games means storage is a critical issue.\nTo remedy this, Seagate has debuted the Game Drive Hub for Xbox \u2014 an 8TB storage and multi-purpose USB hub designed and tested in partnership with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox team. A massive jump from Seagate\u2019s current Game Drive offerings (which currently cap at 4TB), this new iteration is meant for players with mammoth-sized libraries.\nThe Game Drive Hub works with any console in the Xbox One family of devices (Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X), will hold over 200 games with ease, has a plug and play setup, and features two front-facing USB 3.0 ports, making it convenient to charge controllers or connect Xbox One accessories.\nholds over 200 games with ease\nAlso of note is the Game Drive Hub\u2019s refreshed design, which beautifully sits alongside the Xbox One S (pictured above). However, it appears to only come in the white with black accent colorway, meaning it won\u2019t match with the upcoming Xbox One X, only announced thus far in matte black.\nRegardless, with the number of 4K titles ever increasing and Game Pass on the near horizon, its Game Drive Hub\u2019s space that matters \u2014 even ultra-hardcore gamers should find themselves challenged to reach the 8TB threshold. Goodbye, days of deleting old games! (The current average game size is 35GB to 50GB.)\nSeagate\u2019s Game Drive Hub will be available this month at select Seagate resellers for $199.99.\n"}
