{"title": "Radius starts with an unbeatable science fantasy premise, then gets weird", "content": " Welcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review was first posted out of Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. It is being republished to coincide with the film\u2019s VOD release.One of the serious advantages to smaller, indie speculative-fiction movies is that you generally don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting up front. In today\u2019s anticipation culture, websites often drool over every possible detail and reveal about the bigger nerd-friendly properties. It\u2019s easy to walk into a big movie feeling like you already know all the major beats, because they\u2019ve been discussed to death online in \u201cEverything we know about this movie\u201d articles, and \u201cLet\u2019s pick apart this trailer frame-by-frame\u201d videos.And then along comes something unheralded, under-the-radar, and authentically strange, like the Canadian movie Radius. Suddenly the audience is on a fast-paced trip into the unknown, with no idea where this premise could possibly lead. And Radius, the latest collaboration between married writer-director team Caroline Labr\u00e8che and Steeve L\u00e9onard, does start with an unbeatable premise that feels like a solid Stephen King horror story. A man wakes up in a wrecked truck and goes looking for help. His memory is completely gone. He can\u2019t even remember his name. And slowly, he starts to realize that anything living that comes within a certain radius of him instantly drops dead. Warning for the spoiler-averse: this trailer gives away some things that are better discovered by watching the film. What\u2019s the genre?Small-scale indie science fiction thriller. Think something between Safety Not Guaranteed and Colossal.What\u2019s it about?Liam  Diego Klattenhoff, from Homeland and The Blacklist  has no memories after his accident. All he knows is that he\u2019s creating a zone of instant death. Then a woman, also with no memories, comes to the shed where he\u2019s hiding, and introduces herself as Jane Doe. Jane  Charlotte Sullivan, of Chicago Fire and Rookie Blue  has no idea how she knows him, and he has no idea how she can approach him and survive. The rest of the story unfolds from there, as they start piecing together their past and trying to figure out their future.What\u2019s it really about?Labr\u00e8che and L\u00e9onard delve into a couple of interesting ideas here. One is how much loyalty we owe the past. Much like the Canadian science fiction series Dark Matter, Radius explores how much personality and predilections are tied to experience and memory, and whether people who don\u2019t remember their own history have a duty to respect it and connect to it. This isn\u2019t a particularly deep theme in this case: Radius raises the questions, but doesn\u2019t have answers. But it\u2019s a worthwhile thought experiment and conversation starter. And the filmmakers also take an interest in the question of culpability. How much blame can we take for actions we can\u2019t remember? And how much blame should we take for things we can\u2019t help doing? Given the death toll around Liam, is he a murderer or a victim? When he can\u2019t keep people from approaching him, is he responsible for their deaths, or are they? How much does he owe a society that can\u2019t and won\u2019t leave him alone?Is it good?Radius is certainly rough around the edges. It\u2019s the kind of film where the limited budget and tight shooting schedule show through, and the acting can be a little erratic. Klattenhoff and Sullivan are at their strongest during the film\u2019s faster-paced action sequences, where they bring across the desperation of their situation. But they\u2019re both guilty of occasionally falling into a flat, strident affect that\u2019s more suitable to a TV crime drama than a theatrical film. Some of the eventual reveals seem melodramatic, even soap-operatic. The film\u2019s final moments are rushed, and the ending is startlingly abrupt, with no time for reflection. All that falls away during the jaw-dropping moments when new pieces fall into place and Radius reveals where it\u2019s going next. Like other amnesia-based films, from terrific examples like Memento to bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like Unknown, Radius is a puzzle story built around a series of reveals. The script is tight and propulsive; the writer-directors have a talent for not over-explaining the implications of each development, and for giving the audience space to figure things out for themselves. That makes the developments hit harder and feel smarter. Radius is a high-concept movie from start to finish, and it relies on surprises to keep the story moving. One of its biggest strengths is the way it keeps those surprises coming, rather than spending its narrative currency early and then spending the rest of its runtime on fallout.The film\u2019s pacing is also a major boon. L\u00e9onard and Labr\u00e8che time those surprises in a way that builds anticipation and dread by letting viewers stay ahead of the characters. When Liam first starts encountering the white-eyed, limp corpses of the people his power has killed, he initially doesn\u2019t understand, and assumes he\u2019s entered a plague zone. He covers his mouth with cloth and stumbles forward toward the next hapless victim he\u2019s about to create. The audience knows what\u2019s coming, and can cringe in sympathy, waiting for it to happen. The filmmakers play with this dynamic throughout the film, leading the audience along just enough. Radius is an experience in anticipation and tension as much as it is a linear story.What should it be rated?In spite of the body count and some grim, heart-in-mouth action situations, it\u2019s free of sex, gore, and all sorts of other stuff that merits content warnings these days. But kids aren\u2019t likely to get much out of it. Call it PG-13 just to keep yelling children out of the theater.How can I actually watch it?Radius arrives on VOD services  iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, XFINITY, and a lot more  on November 10th. The filmmakers have said it\u2019ll eventually come to Netflix, but no release date has been announced."}
