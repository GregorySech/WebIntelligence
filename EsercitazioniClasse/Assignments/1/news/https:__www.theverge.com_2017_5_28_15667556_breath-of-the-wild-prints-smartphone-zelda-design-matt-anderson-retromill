{"title": "These incredible Breath of the Wild prints are what a mobile Zelda game should look like", "content": " \nArtist Matt Anderson, a graphic designer and illustrator who specializes in a simple, geometric art style, has an ongoing series called RetroMill, where he takes video game characters and reimagines them in colorful, minimalist prints. In a new spinoff of that series called RetroMill: Wild, Anderson has focused exclusively on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with some incredibly beautiful results. \nThe various prints capture Link, the Old Man, a tank-like Guardian, everyone\u2019s favorite dancing tree spirit Hetsu, and more, all rendered in Anderson\u2019s minimalist style, which perfectly captures the feel and art direction of the original game. As for the choice of characters, which notably doesn\u2019t include Princess Zelda or most of the Champions, Anderson told The Verge over email that he found characters like Beedle or Kass, who appear in multiple locations across the open world, more interesting to depict. However, he is hoping to have time to make more in the future, citing Zelda, Mipha, Urbosa, and Kilton as characters he\u2019d like to make in the RetroMill style.  \nAnderson says that he\u2019s been a Zelda fan for a while, and fell in love with Breath of the Wild\u2019s stylized look, which he described as resembling a Miyazaki film. \u201cI grew up playing the Legend of Zelda games with my dad (the 1986 NES original was the first game I ever played),\u201d he explained, \u201cand I've always been drawn the unique items and distinct iconography in Zelda. Pretty much all of my notebooks in grade school were littered with Triforce and Master Sword doodles.\u201d \nNintendo\u2019s own art style in the Zelda games strongly speaks to Anderson\u2019s own artwork; it creates a deliberate art style that will work just as well in 15 or even 50 years as it does today. As Anderson describes it:  \n\u201cAs a designer I have always appreciated Nintendo's choice to favor art direction over hyper-realistic graphics. That approach became especially apparent in Wind Waker which was stylized in a way that has aged much more gracefully than most games of its generation. To me, that is the essence of great design, using limitations to create something beautiful and unique.\u201d\nAnderson started sketching a Guardian while playing the game, using his own \u201crules and limitations to reinterpret the character designs using geometry and color,\u201d and game quickly inspired more prints, to the point where they outnumbered his series, leading him to break them off into their own RetroMill: Wild collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Anderson\n\n\nIn fact, looking at Anderson\u2019s art, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better way that Nintendo could stylize a smartphone Zelda game, as it\u2019s rumored to be working on. While a full 3D Zelda game seems like it wouldn\u2019t work nearly as well on mobile, Anderson\u2019s flattened-down style feels like an ideal take on a two-dimensional Zelda game, instead of just falling back to the creative crutch of re-creating a 16-bit look. Anderson himself commented that he views the RetroMill style as somewhere between modern and classic video game art, noting, \u201cI like to think of the RetroMill look as a 16-bit sprite style, but rendered in more detail and not limited by pixels.\u201d\nEven if we never see anything like it on an actual game, you\u2019ll at least be able to enjoy the artwork for yourself: Anderson is selling a limited number of prints for $20 apiece from his website. There\u2019s more to come, too. Anderson notes that he\u2019d like to draw up illustrations of heroes such as Zelda, Mipha, Urbosa, and Kilton, as well as enemies such as the Lynels and Ganon. \u201cThe reaction to the series has been really humbling,\u201d he says. \u201cI've already gotten dozens of requests, so I'm hoping the community can help me pick what they'd like to see next.\u201d\n"}
