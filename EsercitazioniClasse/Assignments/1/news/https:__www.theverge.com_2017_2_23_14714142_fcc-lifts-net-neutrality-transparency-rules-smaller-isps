{"title": "FCC votes to lift net neutrality transparency rules for smaller internet providers", "content": " \nThe newly Republican-controlled FCC took its first steps to scale back net neutrality today by voting to lift transparency requirements from smaller internet providers.\nInternet providers with fewer than 250,000 subscribers will not be required to disclose information on network performance, fees, and data caps, thanks to this rule change. The commission had initially exempted internet providers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers with the intention of revisiting the issue later to determine whether a higher or lower figure was appropriate.\n\u201cThe majority has decided to exempt billion dollar companies from being transparent with consumers.\u201d\nThe rule passed in a 2-1 vote, with Republicans saying the reporting requirements unfairly burdened smaller ISPs with additional work.\nOnly Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn opposed. Clyburn argued that the disclosures were an important consumer protection that was far from overbearing on businesses, particularly ones this large.\n\u201cIn an ongoing quest to dismantle basic consumer protections for broadband services, the majority has decided to exempt billion dollar companies from being transparent with consumers,\u201d Clyburn said.\nClyburn also argued that the rule would allow larger internet providers to avoid disclosing information by simply breaking their service areas up into different subsidiaries.\nRepublican commissioner Michael O'Rielly voted in favor of the change, saying he actually would have preferred the subscriber exemption to be even higher.\nAnd commission chairman Ajit Pai said the rules were necessary to protect \u201cmom and pop internet service providers\u201d from \u201cburdensome requirements ... that impose serious and unnecessary costs.\u201d\nPai landed on the 250,000 subscriber figure by pointing to a bipartisan proposal in Congress that would have led to the same exemption. That legislation passed the House but stalled in the Senate. However, that bill also asked the FCC to reassess the 250,000 limit after about six months, whereas this exemption is locked in for five years.\n"}
