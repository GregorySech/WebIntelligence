{"title": "The Emmys showed that peak TV may help solve cinema's diversity problem", "content": " \nHollywood\u2019s weaknesses involving diversity and representation have come under fire in recent years, and no single flashpoint exemplified these issues like the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. In 2015, activist April Reign called out the Academy Awards on Twitter when all 20 acting nominees were white. Her hashtag went viral, and essentially defined the way many view the entertainment industry\u2019s awards ceremonies: as bellwethers for its larger, institutional issues when it comes to race and gender.\nSo it should be considered good news that the 69th Emmy Awards ceremony this past Sunday was, in many ways, an example of diversity in action. Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win the Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series, while The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s Reed Morano became the first woman to win the award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 22 years. Donald Glover became the first black director to pick up the Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series award, and Riz Ahmed was the first South Asian man to ever win an Emmy acting award. \nIt\u2019s absurd that after 69 years of the Emmys, we\u2019re only now seeing these kinds of groundbreaking firsts. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, frankly,\u201d Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes told Vanity Fair about the number of \u201cfirsts\u201d in the show. But in many ways, the Emmys ceremony was the kind of inclusive step forward that other awards shows like the Oscars have often seemed afraid to take. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\n\nThis is in part due to the incredible amount of television content that\u2019s currently being produced. In his opening monologue, Emmys host Stephen Colbert commented that there were 450 scripted shows last year. That\u2019s a huge number, but with it comes a huge opportunity. A 2016 study from GLAAD showed that representation has been increasing in television when it comes to women, people of color, and LGBTQ characters. It\u2019s the hidden gift of this era of peak TV: with so many shows, sometimes the best way to break through the noise is to address an audience, or focus on a cultural experience, that simply hasn\u2019t been represented before. \nThe rise of streaming services has only accelerated that trend. Subscription-based services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime don\u2019t have to worry about conventional ratings. Instead, they\u2019re focused on ensuring they have a broad, diverse assortment of programming with something to appeal to all potential customers. Niches have popped up as a result, providing chances for shows like Master of None to thrive \u2014 and win Emmys \u2014 even while 76 percent of Americans still haven\u2019t heard of it.\n\u201cthe film industry still functions as a straight white boy\u2019s club\u201d\nBy contrast, the film industry barely seems to be moving forward. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the body behind the Academy Awards, has taken steps to increase diversity among its own membership, but representation in films themselves is another matter. A 2016 study by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that women accounted for less than one-third of all speaking characters in major studio films. In television, 42 percent of series regulars were women. The schism between film and television holds true behind the camera as well: the study states that \u201cthe film industry still functions as a straight white boy\u2019s club.\u201d A USC study published this past February also found that, despite the larger conversations about representation, there was no meaningful change in the number of female, black, or Asian film directors between 2007 and 2016. Of the 1,000 top-grossing films in that time frame, the study found that just three black women, two Asian women, and one Latina had been hired as directors. \nWith predominantly white directors, movie audiences are still getting historical films with all-white casts. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk told the story of British soldiers trying to escape France in World War II, but ignored the presence of Indian, Algerian, and Moroccan soldiers. Sofia Coppola\u2019s Civil War drama The Beguiled nixed the black character who was a major part of the source novel. The director later defended her film by explaining she didn\u2019t want to include a token slave character without properly fleshing the character out, and \u201cthere wasn\u2019t room to tell that whole story.\u201d That\u2019s the beauty of television: it\u2019s become a medium that\u2019s providing opportunity for creators interested in telling stories about people of color, resulting in increasingly diverse shows like Insecure and Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n\n\nIn spite of these successes, the television landscape is still far from perfect. Television still has a dearth of Asian actors in lead roles, which was reflected yet again in this year\u2019s Emmy nominations. Not to mention, many of the highest-profile roles \u2014 Aziz Ansari in Master of None, or Mindy Kaling in The Mindy Project \u2014 are self-created, rather than the result of diverse, representative casting. \nNevertheless, the 69th Emmy Awards ceremony, and the era of television that spawned it, illustrate a potential path forward that could help the film industry tackle its representation issues. As services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon increasingly invest in film, perhaps they\u2019ll do there what they\u2019ve already done in television: create an ecosystem where a broad range of diverse titles becomes the rule rather than the exception. Maybe streaming services can bring about an era of \u201cpeak movies\u201d that audiences have been eager for all along.\n\n"}
