{"title": "Apple\u2019s new HomePod speaker is really cute in person", "content": " \nI just spent a moment with Apple\u2019s new HomePod intelligent speaker, which kind of looks like a mesh-wrapped Mac Pro. It comes in black and white, and it\u2019s cute. Like a cute little ovoid thing. It has seven tweeters in the bottom, along with a four-inch woofer, and six microphones at the top. It\u2019s about the size of two large grapefruits stacked on top of each other, I guess, if I needed to describe it. Smaller than a breadbox, anyway.\nWhen you say \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d it lights up at the top with a little waveform, and you can ask for a lot of Siri-type things, like reminders, timers, and random questions. Or at least, it\u2019s supposed to do that. In the \u201cdemo\u201d area, I looked around at all the Apple representatives, said \u201cHey, Siri\u201d in a clear voice, and all I heard in response was the sound of their laughter. Nice try, Dieter.\nThe bit on top that lights up is neat, though. It looks a lot like the waveform you see on Siri when you speak to it on your phone \u2014 though, of course, this doesn\u2019t look like a complete LCD here. You won\u2019t be getting any visual answers out of the HomePod.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also an A8 chip inside that does automatic EQ and echo cancellation with beamforming for the tweeters \u2014 it detects the size and shape of a room to tune the best sound. Again, this isn\u2019t something Apple is showing in the demo area, but given the company\u2019s ability to make great hardware, I bet it works well. I\u2019m actually more curious to know how Apple is handling multi-room setups \u2014 something no company not named \u201cSonos\u201d has really figured out.\nApple\u2019s also promoting the privacy aspects of the HomePod \u2014 it doesn\u2019t send anything to Apple until you say \u201cHey Siri,\u201d and then it sends data using an anonymous encrypted Siri ID. We\u2019ll have to learn a lot more about what that means, of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s billing the HomePod as a home music speaker first of all, connecting it to the iPod, iPhone, Apple Music, and AirPods. So there\u2019s a lot of focus on Apple Music integration. Even still, with integrated microphones and Siri, it obviously competes with Amazon\u2019s various Echo devices and Google Home, and Apple hasn\u2019t really discussed in detail how Siri and HomeKit will match the extensibility of those platforms. But it\u2019s exciting, and we\u2019ll see when it ships in December for $349.\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s about all we can say about this thing for now. The HomePods are here in the demo area, but they\u2019re nonfunctional beyond lighting up. I plan on going back into the demo zone and hollering \u201cHey Siri\u201d again, and I\u2019ll report back if anything there changes.\n\n"}
