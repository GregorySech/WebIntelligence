{"title": "Huawei\u2019s new MateBook X is another spin on a modern MacBook Air", "content": " \nThe MateBook was Huawei\u2019s first shot at building a Windows 10 laptop, but it largely missed the mark on several aspects. But Huawei is back with a trio of new laptops that look to build out the company\u2019s computer offerings while addressing the issues from its first attempt. \nFirst up is the MateBook X, a 13-inch Windows 10 ultraportable that fixes a lot of the problems users had with the original MateBook. It features a traditional aluminum clamshell design instead of a 2-in-1 configuration, has Intel Core i5 and i7 processors instead of the less powerful Core m series, and can allegedly last up to 10 hours while watching 1080p video on a single charge. \nThe rest of the MateBook X\u2019s hardware is similarly impressive \u2014 the 13-inch display offers a 3:2 aspect ratio at 2K resolution with a 4.4mm bezel (it is not a touchscreen, however), storage comes in either 256GB or 512GB SSD options, while the power button doubles as a Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader. The only qualm I have is RAM, which will come in 4GB or 8GB options, but given the portable-focused nature of the MateBook X, 8GB should be enough for the average user.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\n\nThe MateBook X uses USB-C, and offers a pair of ports \u2014 one for charging, and one for data transfer. But to make the transition easier, Huawei is including a MateDock 2.0 USB-C dongle in the box in some markets, which offers a regular USB Type-A port, DVI, HDMI, and a second USB-C port for pass-through charging. \nHuawei is also partnering with Dolby for what it calls the Atmos Sound System, which combines hardware and software elements from Dolby to offer a better sound experience. Having briefly demoed the feature, the MateBook X certainly sounded good (along with some fun 3D audio tricks), but given the lackluster nature of most laptop speakers, it\u2019s not a high bar to clear.  \nI only had a few minutes to try out the MateBook X, but it made a great impression. It\u2019s thin, light, fast, and if Huawei\u2019s promises about battery life hold up in real-world testing, then the MateBook X could be a really good portable laptop option that could offer a legitimate challenge to Apple\u2019s languishing MacBook Air line. Of course, that will also largely depend on price, which Huawei didn\u2019t offer in advance of the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\n\nNext is the MateBook E, which is an updated version of the original MateBook. It offers the same basic design (including the leather folio keyboard), but upgrades the screen to a 2K panel from 1080p and improves the magnets connecting the folio to the table. Most importantly, Huawei claims that the MateBook E offers up to nine hours of battery life, which would be a significant improvement over the original, assuming it holds up. \nLastly, there\u2019s the MateBook D, which Huawei didn\u2019t have available to demo in advance. The MateBook D is a 15-inch computer targeting a wider, midrange group of customers. Specs are less interesting on the MateBook D \u2014 a 1080p display, configurations offering Intel\u2019s i5 and i7 processor, 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB of RAM (depending on how much you\u2019re willing to pay), and a choice between a 1TB hard drive by itself or supplemented with an additional SSD. Some models will also offer a dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940 MX graphics card, which should be good for casual gaming. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\n\nThat said, despite its more mainstream ambitions, Huawei notes that the MateBook D still offers a thin, all-metal design and the same Dolby Atmos Sound System as the MateBook X, which the company hopes will set it apart from similarly specced laptops. \nThe three new MateBooks are expected to ship this summer. \n"}
