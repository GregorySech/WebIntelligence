{"title": "7 things we learned from Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla shareholder meeting", "content": " \nTesla\u2019s shareholders voted this afternoon at their annual meeting against declassifying the electric car company\u2019s board of directors. Critics have said that Tesla\u2019s board is not independent enough, and that it\u2019s filled with people who are incentivized to stay in CEO Elon Musk\u2019s good graces. Declassifying would have made the directors subject to annual elections, but the outcome of the vote means the board will keep its staggered, three-year terms.  \nBut, as is consistently the case with Tesla, Elon Musk stole the show when he came onstage to speak to the shareholders and answer questions from Twitter. Compared to how his loose lips have ignited some of his past speaking engagements, this one was surprisingly light on shock value. There were still a few interesting tidbits, though. \nOur first \u201clook\u201d at the Model Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusk first teased the Model Y in October 2015 when he tweeted, and then deleted, a short mention of the company\u2019s forthcoming all-electric crossover SUV. He\u2019s been light on details ever since, as the company has been focused on launching the Model X and Model 3. At the meeting today, though, he flashed what is our first glimpse of the Y. \nThere\u2019s very little to go off of in that image, I know, but it appears in line with what Musk has said about the car. It will be a crossover, one that\u2019s sized smaller than a Model X but bigger than the Model 3. It will also be a much simpler car with respect to the electrical systems inside \u2014 Musk said last month that the Y will have far less wiring than its other cars as the company moves away from its standard 12-volt battery architecture. \nMusk also said last month that the Model Y, which is targeted for 2019, would be built on an entirely new vehicle architecture platform, contradicting assumptions that it would be built on the Model 3\u2019s platform as a cost-saving measure. Musk said today that \u201cthere are a number of really major manufacturing improvements that can be done that allow us to build a car in a way that a car\u2019s never been built before\u201d by building the Model Y on a new platform.\nBuilding the Model X on the Model S platform was \u201ca mistake\u201d\nIn fact, Musk justified starting a new platform for the Model Y by trashing the platform-borrowing approach that it has taken with its cars so far. \u201cI think actually we made a mistake in trying to derive the Model X from the model S platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been better to just design an SUV the way an SUV should be designed, [and] design a sedan the way a sedan should be designed. Otherwise you\u2019re just trying to shoehorn something in that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \nThe first Model 3s will be \u201cvery simple\u201d\nThe Model 3 is the car that\u2019s supposed to bring Tesla to the masses, and yet it wasn\u2019t discussed much \u2014 even though it\u2019s launching this summer. Musk did say, though, that the configurator for those who have preordered the car will go live toward the end of next month, when the first Model 3s roll off the line. \nEarly Model 3 owners will have to live with limited options\nBut he added that those customers will have to deal with a very limited set of options \u2014 essentially color and wheel type \u2014 in order to make sure the company can ramp up production accordingly. \n\u201cI should say that we\u2019ve kept the initial configurations of the Model 3 very simple,\u201d Musk said. \u201cA big mistake we made with the X, which is primarily my responsibility \u2014 there was way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish.\u201d \nMusk said he\u2019s learned from the Model X rollout, which allowed for so much customization at launch that Tesla wound up hurting its own production timelines. \u201c[Model X] is like a faberg\u00e9 egg of cars. It\u2019s really an amazing product, but it has way too many cool things in it that should have really been rolled in with version two, version three,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got overconfident and created something great that probably will never be made again. And perhaps should not be.\u201d\nMusk says Tesla\u2019s own semi-autonomous software is almost better than it was before the Mobileye breakup\nThe tech provided by Israeli company Mobileye was a big part of what powered Tesla\u2019s semi-autonomous capabilities in the early going. But the two companies argued mightily last year over who was to blame for the man who died while using the Autopilot system. When the collaboration disintegrated, Tesla had to rebuild Autopilot using its own hardware and software, and it\u2019s only now that Musk feels Tesla\u2019s version is about to eclipse the level of semi-autonomous driving Mobileye had made possible. \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a tough slog.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a tough slog transitioning from the Mobileye vision chip to Tesla\u2019s internal vision system, but I think we\u2019re almost there in terms of exceeding the ability of the hardware one cars,\u201d he said. \u201cI think with the next release of software, which is maybe as soon as next week, we will finally exceed the experience of the hardware one cars, and then it\u2019s going to advance very rapidly from there.\u201d \nTesla is letting customers of its upcoming semi truck help with design\nTesla is working on making an all-electric, heavy-duty big rig that it plans to unveil at an event this September. We\u2019ve known that for a while, but what\u2019s new is that Musk said the company is collaborating with potential customers of the semi truck to help design it correctly. \n\u201cWe\u2019re getting them closely involved in the design process, so the biggest customers of the heavy duty Tesla semi are helping ensure that it is specified to their needs, so it\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Musk told the shareholders. \u201cThey already know that it\u2019s going to meet their needs, because they\u2019ve told us what those needs are. So it\u2019ll really just be a question of scaling volume to make as many as we can.\u201d \nMusk added that he hopes to reach production scale on the Tesla Semi in two years. \nSomething else could be announced at the Semi Truck event in September\nMusk got cheeky when he was asked whether Tesla is working on anything else in addition to its road cars, semi truck, home battery storage service, and solar panel business. \u201cThere\u2019s a few other things I haven\u2019t mentioned here. I just like, really recommend showing up for the semi truck unveiling,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little more than we\u2019re saying here. Maybe. Could be. Who knows?\u201d \nMusk finally explains his erratic Twitter behavior\nElon Musk is famous for his late night Twitter proclamations and, sometimes, rants. Asked a question about how he splits his time between his many companies, he said that \u201ctweet frequency has no correlation with what I actually do for a work basis.\u201d Meaning that, while he tweets a lot about the Boring Company \u2014 his effort to dig a massive tunnel system under Los Angeles \u2014 he still considers that \u201cbasically a hobby.\u201d \nMusk also admitted that he \u201csometimes goes crazy\u201d on Twitter. \u201cYou know, [when] there\u2019s a little red wine, a vintage record player, some ambien. Magic. Magic happens.\u201d \n(He later echoed the sentiment on Twitter, of course.)\n\n\nA little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 7, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
