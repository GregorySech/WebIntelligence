{"title": "Nintendo\u2019s SNES Classic will be available at Toys R Us stores Friday morning", "content": " Still in search of the elusive miniature Super Nintendo? Toys R Us is the latest retailer to get a re-up on its SNES Classic supply. The company today announced that all of its US stores will have Nintendo\u2019s $80 mini console available on Friday. \u201cSince quantities are limited, we encourage customers to get in line before doors open on Friday morning for a chance to purchase,\u201d a spokesperson told The Verge. A firm date is a little easier to plan for than randomly checking your nearest GameStop throughout a given week. There are no bundles or other nonsense to deal with at Toys R Us, but Friday also marks the release of Super Mario Odyssey for Nintendo Switch, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see other retailers join in with a shipment of SNES Classic units to go along with it. Toys R Us is selling a Switch bundle with the new Mario game included, but that\u2019s separate from the Classic.  The company warns that this too will be in short supply. And don\u2019t forget that a 3DS XL styled like the SNES is coming to the US as well, in case just one retro-ish gadget isn\u2019t enough. "}
