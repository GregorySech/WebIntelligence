{"title": "Facebook Messenger gets reactions for individual messages and @ notifications", "content": " \nFacebook is adding two new features to Messenger: reactions and mentions. Reactions let you respond to any individual message in a chat with various emoji (just tap and hold to add a reaction, just like you would for a post on your Facebook feed); while mentions lets you @ someone in a group chat, which sends them a direct notification. \nAs with reactions on your News Feed, anyone can see who reacted to what message with what, and you can add a reaction to anything \u2014 even other emoji if you want to get meta. As for mentions, Facebook says the feature will let the person who is tagged \u201cjump right back in to the conversation to answer someone\u2019s question or to provide a response.\u201d So, you know, this is basically a feature for hassling friends who are nominally present in the group chat, but definitely not paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentioning someone will send them a direct notification (far left), while you can tap and hold to react to an individual message (center and right).\nImage: Facebook\n\n\nAnd while Messenger app is adding features to make it more like Facebook proper, the main Facebook app is experimenting with a new comment system that looks more like Messenger. Who knows, perhaps after unbundling chat from Facebook, Facebook wants to bundle them back together? That makes no sense of course, but at least they\u2019re not putting Stories in another app. \n"}
