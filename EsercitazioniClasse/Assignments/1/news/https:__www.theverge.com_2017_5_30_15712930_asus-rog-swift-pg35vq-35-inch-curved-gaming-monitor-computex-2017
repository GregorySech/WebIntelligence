{"title": "Asus cranked its new 35-inch curved gaming monitor up to 200Hz", "content": " \nLast week, Acer announced its new 35-inch curved flagship gaming monitor, which means, of course, that Acer's long-standing rival Asus had to bring an even better 35-inch display to Computex this week.\nThe new ROG Swift PG35VQ, spotted by Engadget, has a quantum dot LCD with a 3440 x 1440 resolution and HDR \u2014 in fact, it's the exact same AU Optronics panel that's in Acer's latest, although Acer doesn't list HDR as a spec for some reason. What really differentiates the PG35VQ for Asus is the addition of a 200Hz refresh rate. Acer is only advertising 100Hz, overclockable to 120Hz. Both displays have G-Sync.\nWhile resolution and image quality are important, refresh rate and response time are the most important spec for any gaming monitor, which gives the Swift PG35VQ an edge in the eternal rivalry between these two Taiwanese companies. I'm still unconvinced on the value of an ultrawide display, especially because e-sports games like Overwatch and League of Legends traditionally don't support them at all. For certain types of games and gamers they've become a new must-have, and 35-inches at this 21:9 aspect ratio means the vertical screen real estate isn't abysmal.\nNo word on price, but I wouldn't expect Asus to veer far from Acer's $1,100-ish price tag.\n"}
