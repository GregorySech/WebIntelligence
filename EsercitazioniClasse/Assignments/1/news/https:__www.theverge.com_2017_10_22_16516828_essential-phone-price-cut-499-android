{"title": "The Essential Phone now costs $499, $200 less than the original price", "content": " \nEssential is slashing the price of its eponymous phone, down to $499 at its website. That\u2019s a $200 price cut from the original $699 price, less than two months after it began shipping to customers. There is really no other way to read the move except as a signal that it wasn\u2019t selling well at $699 \u2014 especially given that the only US carrier stores it\u2019s available in have \u201cSprint\u201d above the door. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that it now has to face the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL head-to-head.\nOf course, that\u2019s not how Essential sees it, saying that the price drop is there in lieu of \u201ca massive TV campaign to capture your attention,\u201d which is hard not to see as a wry Google and Apple dig. \u201cWe think making it easier for people to get their hands on our first products is a better way to get to know us,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post adds.\nAn aggressive price cut\nIt\u2019s common for Android phone prices to go down over time, but this is an aggressive price drop both in its timing and its amount. To help salve the burn that customers who paid the full price might be feeling, the company is offering a $200 Essential Store \u201cfriends & family code\u201d to be used towards the purchase of another phone or a module. The only module available thus far, of course, is the 360 camera.\nIn the time since Essential released the phone, it has made good on its promise to release software updates to improve camera performance \u2014 though it\u2019s neither as fast nor as good as what you\u2019ll get on a Galaxy S8 or Pixel 2. Depending on how you feel about the camera\u2019s importance, $499 is either a steal or the appropriate price for this phone. \n"}
