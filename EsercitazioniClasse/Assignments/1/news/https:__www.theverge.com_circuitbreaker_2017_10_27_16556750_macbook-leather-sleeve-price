{"title": "Apple now sells an expensive leather sleeve for 12-inch MacBooks", "content": " Apple has quietly released an elegant looking leather sleeve for 12-inch MacBooks that\u2019s blind-embossed with the company\u2019s logo. It\u2019s the first sleeve of its kind from Apple, which until now has only sold third-party MacBook cases. Apple says the design allows you to charge your laptop while it\u2019s sitting in the case, and ships in Saddle Brown and Midnight Blue for $149.The price may seem a little steep, but Apple says the sleeve is \u201ccrafted from high-quality European leather with a soft microfiber lining,\u201d which certainly sounds posh. It\u2019s available now from the Apple Store, and ships within one business day. That looks a lot better than the five weeks plus  and counting!  you\u2019re going to have to wait for an iPhone X preorder. So if you own a MacBook and need to fill an iPhone-X-shaped hole then maybe this is the purchase for you.Underside of the Apple leather sleeve in midnight blue.Image: Apple"}
