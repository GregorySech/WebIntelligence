{"title": "Drake\u2019s More Life has already broken two Spotify records", "content": " \nDrake\u2019s newest release, More Life, has only been out since Saturday and it\u2019s already broken two Spotify records. On its first full day of availability, More Life was streamed 61,302,082 times, surpassing Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide for first-day album streams. Drake also broke the record on Sunday for single-day artist streams, with 76,355,041 streams.\nSheeran\u2019s album held the record for less than a month, but his dethroning is not exactly surprising. Drake was Spotify\u2019s most-streamed artist in 2015 and 2016, and his Views track \u201cOne Dance\u201d is still the most-streamed song on the service. \nApple Music hasn\u2019t released any More Life numbers yet, but chances are the album will do well there too. Last year\u2019s Views, which was initially released as an Apple Music exclusive, was the first album ever to reach 1 billion streams on the platform.\nAs streaming services continue to grow their audiences, and artists still holding out (cough, cough Taylor Swift) start to recognize their value, these sorts of records are likely to shift with even greater frequency. But for now, Drake can pretty much count on another good year on top. \n"}
