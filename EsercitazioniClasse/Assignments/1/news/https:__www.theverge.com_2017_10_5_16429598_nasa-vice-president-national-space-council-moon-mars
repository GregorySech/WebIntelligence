{"title": "NASA will put humans on the Moon again, Mike Pence tells space council", "content": " \nAfter months of hinting, Vice President Mike Pence finally made it clear today that the Trump administration will direct NASA to land humans on the Moon and establish a more permanent presence on the lunar surface. It's a return to the vision of President George W. Bush, which was deferred when President Obama reoriented the space agency toward a journey to Mars.\nPence made the administration\u2019s intentions known in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, as well as a speech he gave during the inaugural meeting of the National Space Council \u2014 a newly resurrected executive group aimed at guiding the US space agenda. \u201cWe will return NASA astronauts to the Moon \u2014 not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation, we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,\u201d he said to a crowd of representatives and press at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\u201cto build the foundation, we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a move that many within the space community have suspected for a while. Pence suggested a return to the Moon during a speech at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in July. And many members of the National Space Council and Trump\u2019s NASA transition team have been advocates of lunar missions. However it still marks a fundamental change for the space agency, which has been focused on sending humans to Mars since 2010 \u2014 without any plans for landing people on the Moon. \nFor now, it\u2019s unknown how this destination shift will affect NASA\u2019s long-term plans. For the last decade, NASA has been developing a new rocket and spacecraft \u2014 the Space Launch System and Orion \u2014 to take astronauts into deep space and onto Mars. The current plan is to use these vehicles to build a space station in the vicinity of the Moon, known as the Deep Space Gateway, where astronauts can train and then depart for missions to Mars. But it\u2019s possible those vehicles could be used to go to the Moon\u2019s surface instead. Versions of the SLS rocket and Orion capsule were originally conceived as part of the Constellation program \u2014 an effort under Bush to take astronauts to the Moon that was canceled by Obama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the first ever meeting of the National Space Council, with Space Shuttle Discovery in the background.\nPhoto by Mark Wilson / Getty Images\n\n\nIt seems likely that NASA will leverage partnerships with commercial companies to help it get back to the Moon. A big focus of today\u2019s council meeting revolved around how NASA works with private space companies to pull off its missions in space. \u201cAmerican companies are on the cutting edge of space technology, and they\u2019re developing new rockets, spaceships, and satellites that will take us further into space faster than ever before,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBy fostering much stronger partnerships between the federal government and the realm of industry, and bringing the full force of our national interests to bear, American leadership in space will be assured.\u201d Pence also stressed the importance of commercial companies maintaining a permanent presence in lower Earth orbit so that NASA could focus on deep-space missions.\nit\u2019s unclear what truly lies ahead for NASA\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear what truly lies ahead for NASA, as most of today\u2019s National Space Council meeting was big on talk, while light on concrete strategies. The meeting was filled with presentations from various space industry leaders \u2014 including those from SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. The representatives of these companies discussed how their organizations could best serve NASA in achieving its goals, either by providing rockets and services or by building new space vehicles. SpaceX\u2019s Gwynne Shotwell touted the company\u2019s successful Falcon 9 rocket launches and landings, while Boeing reminded NASA of its long history building the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.\nAbove all, Pence stressed that the US would lead in space again under the Trump administration. He spent a great deal of his speech lamenting the fact that American astronauts have not launched into deep space in the last 45 years, and that NASA is currently relying on Russian vehicles to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. \u201cAmerica seems to have lost our edge in space,\u201d said Pence, \u201cand those days are over.\u201d \nBut it could be some time before we know how the Trump administration plans to lead in space again. No new policies are coming out of the National Space Council meeting, and it\u2019s ultimately up to Congress to decide how NASA\u2019s budget is spent. Perhaps we\u2019ll see some changes to the budget later this year, or perhaps with the president\u2019s budget request early next year. \u201cWith the upcoming budget process, we will look to solidify this work with our new goals in place,\u201d NASA\u2019s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot said in a statement. But for now, NASA\u2019s route to the Moon isn\u2019t truly certain.\n"}
