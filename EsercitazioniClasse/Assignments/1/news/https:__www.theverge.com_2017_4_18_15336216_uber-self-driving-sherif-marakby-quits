{"title": "Uber loses another executive as self-driving program lead quits", "content": " \nAs Uber continues to make the headlines for the wrong reasons, it also keeps on losing executives. The latest big name is to quit is Sherif Marakby \u2014 its vice president of global vehicle programs, and one of the orchestrators of its self-driving vehicle program. \nMarakby was poached just last April from Ford, where he had spent the previous 25 years, rising to the rank of director of global electronics and engineering. In a statement issued at the time, Marakby said that he was focused on safety, explaining that auto accidents were the most common cause of death among young people. \nHe went on to oversee the creation and launch of Uber\u2019s ongoing self-driving vehicle initiatives, but apparently decided to cut ties with the company before it reached the next phase of its plans. \u201cSelf-driving is one of the most interesting challenges I\u2019ve worked on in my career, and I\u2019m grateful to have contributed  to what will soon be a safer future for everyone,\u201d he said in a new statement that confirmed his departure, but didn\u2019t offer a reasoning. \nUber, too, didn\u2019t offer an explanation for Marakby\u2019s departure, but told TechCrunch that \u201cSherif\u2019s deep experience and knowledge of the automotive industry have helped us tremendously in working to make self-driving cars a reality.\u201d In leaving, he follows Uber\u2019s vice president of product and growth, its head of communications, and head of AI labs \u2014 all of whom quit in the last few months alone. \n"}
