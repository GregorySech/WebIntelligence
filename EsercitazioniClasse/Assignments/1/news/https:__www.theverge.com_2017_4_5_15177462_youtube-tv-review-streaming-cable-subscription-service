{"title": "YouTube TV review: a DVR to rule them all", "content": " \nYoung people in the United States have already made the switch from traditional television to streaming services. The amount of time these folks spend watching TV has been dropping steadily for at least six years, while consumption of streaming video has been growing at a torrid pace. And this group is increasingly unlikely to pay for television or own a TV set. \nInto this world comes YouTube TV, an attempt to marry the world\u2019s most popular platform for streaming video with the programming of traditional television. For $35 a month, subscribers will get access to the four major broadcast networks and a bundle of over 40 cable channels, including key sports properties like ESPN and Fox Sports 1. \nThe service is starting in just five cities\nOf course, there are plenty of big gaps in YouTube TV\u2019s current offering. While the goal is to capture the attention of fickle youth, the service won\u2019t carry Viacom channels like MTV or Comedy Central, at least not for the time being. Showtime is available for an additional charge, but HBO isn\u2019t yet. At launch, the service will only be offered in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area, with the promise of more to come soon; YouTube is still working out deals with local affiliates in cities across the US. \nLike all the options in the world of streaming television, YouTube TV is a compromise. But if you\u2019re in the market for an alternative to cable and need to have the big four networks and live sports, this is definitely one of the strongest options available.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting aside the exact selection of channels, which is likely to change quickly, the experience of YouTube TV on a smartphone is impressive. When you open the app, the home tab automatically displays a carousel of live programming. You swipe through to find something you like and click to start watching. If you\u2019ve favorited a particular show, say SportsCenter or NCIS, it will automatically record to your cloud DVR. That means you can easily scrub back to the beginning of an episode if you don\u2019t start watching until it\u2019s halfway through. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Oestlien, product management director at YouTube TV.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a more traditional channel guide approach to browsing, you can swipe over the \u201clive\u201d tab. This gives you a menu of channels to scroll through; click on any channel to start watching and you get a menu of related programming below as well as recently watched content. Flip your phone from vertical to horizontal to go fullscreen. If you decide to cast the stream to your TV, your phone will shift from a viewer to a controller. \u201cOne of the great things about casting, now your phone can transform itself into a remote,\u201d says Christian Oestlien, YouTube TV\u2019s product management director. \u201cWhile you\u2019re casting you can minimize the player and start browsing again.\u201d \nThe DVR offering is best in class\nYoutube TV\u2019s DVR function offers an unlimited amount of cloud storage and will save recordings for nine months at a time. This is a compelling offer when stacked up against some of the other streaming services in the market. Sling TV charges $5 per month for 50 hours of cloud DVR storage and Sony\u2019s Vue service offers unlimited storage, but only for 28 days. DirecTV Now currently has no cloud DVR option, although it\u2019s said something will be announced in the near future. Hulu has said it will offer a cloud DVR with its streaming service, but still hasn\u2019t set a firm date for the launch. Since there is no reason to limit yourself, adding items to your DVR becomes kind of addictive; I found myself adding almost everything that seemed remotely interesting, just in case.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people talk about it being the golden age of TV programming, and I would agree with that,\u201d said Kelly Merryman, YouTube\u2019s VP of content partnership. People of all ages love TV, but when folks between the ages of 18 and 34 look at television today \u201cby and large the distribution of it doesn\u2019t meet their needs. The result of that is we see more \u2018cord nevers\u2019 and a few more cord cutters.\u201d \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Merryman, VP of content partnership, YouTube.\n\n\n\nBuilding a solid mobile app solves one part of that problem, and the unlimited DVR tries to shift TV to a more on-demand experience. The other big selling point for YouTube TV is its powerful search capabilities. This is a technology that Google and YouTube have been perfecting for over a decade \u2014 and it shows. You can do your typical search for a TV series, film, actor, or genre, but you can also do a broader query, like \u201ctime travel,\u201d and the service is smart enough to show you all the programming it has access to that features that theme. \nYouTube invested heavily in sports\nSports is one of the big draws of traditional television, and YouTube TV has placed a special emphasis on organizing this content. You can select your favorite teams or leagues and the service will bundle these into folders so you can easily hop in and find recent matches. Once you let YouTube TV know your favorite league or team, it will also save all games to your DVR, no matter what channel it appears on. Since a lot of the experience is personalized around what you save and search for, YouTube TV offers six individually personalized accounts and three concurrent streams with your monthly subscription. That\u2019s about the middle of the pack: Sony Vue offers five concurrent streams, DirecTV Now offers two, and Sling offers between one and four streams depending on the package you purchase.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor $35 per month, YouTube TV will offer live linear feeds as they air from Disney (ABC), NBCUniversal, CBS, Fox, and AMC Networks. Availability may vary by market. Stations marked with an asterix (*) are slated to arrive but won\u2019t be available at launch. \nDisney:\n\nBroadcast: ABC\nNational Cable: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3*, ESPNU, ESPNews, SEC Network, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform\n\nNBCUniversal:\n\nBroadcast: NBC, Telemundo*\nNational Cable: Bravo, Chiller, CNBC, E!, Golf Channel, MSNBC, Universo*, NBCSN, Oxygen, Sprout, SyFy, Universal HD, USA\nRegional Cable: Comcast Regional Sports Networks, NECN (New England Cable News)\n\nCBS: \n\nBroadcast: CBS, The CW\nNational Cable: CBS Sports Network\n\nFox: \n\nBroadcast: FOX\nNational Cable: FS1 (Fox Sports 1), FS2 (Fox Sports 2), BTN (Big Ten Network), FX, FXX, FXM, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, Fox News, Fox Business\nRegional Cable: Fox Regional Sports Networks\n\nAMC Networks*:\nAMC, BBC America, BBC World News, WE TV, IFC, Sundance TV\nThe Weather Channel:\nLocal Now*\n\n\n\nLike all streaming services, YouTube TV is hobbled a bit by blackout restrictions that keep you from watching live programming if you\u2019re not in the area. You have to set your home address when you sign up and you can\u2019t use the service without GPS enabled. You can watch your favorite sports teams live when you\u2019re home, but not when you\u2019re on the road. Luckily, the service will still save everything to your DVR, and once it\u2019s stored in the cloud, you can watch the programming no matter where you are. \nYou can watch stuff on mobile, but the app is really designed to work with a Chromecast or Cast-enabled television. As with any other Cast-enabled app, once you push stuff to the big screen, your smartphone or tablet becomes your remote. That lets you do simple things like search with your voice instead of typing things out. You can also scroll through other programming without changing the channel from what you\u2019re watching. This works best with stuff on the TV, but if you\u2019re mobile, the app offers a picture-in-picture mode so you can browse for something better without leaving the show you\u2019re on. I have a first-generation Chromecast, and the app warned me of performance issues. But over 48 hours of use, I didn\u2019t experience any beyond a bit of a delay when starting a stream.   \nIt\u2019s easy, from that perspective, to understand why the television studios signed on for this partnership. They get paid to license content they are already run ads against and a chance to connect with young people who are addicted to YouTube and mobile. But why is YouTube getting into this business? It\u2019s hard to imagine that it sees it as a big money-making opportunity. It has to pay to license all the content and probably won\u2019t make money from the ads that have already been sold against TV shows. True, it might introduce some new people to its own original programming, but those shows definitely don\u2019t get top billing in the app. \nThe best answer I can think of is that YouTube sees this as a chance to establish a paying relationship with users who have always thought of the service as a place to get free entertainment. YouTube gets to own the data about usage and viewing patterns that can be leveraged to better attract and target future customers. Not to mention, it becomes the primary interface for your living room \u2014 a powerful position to occupy.\nPhotography by James Bareham \nVideo by Phil Esposito and Matty Greene\n"}
