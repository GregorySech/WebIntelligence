{"title": "How do astronauts exercise in space?", "content": " \nThe environment of the International Space Station isn\u2019t exactly hospitable to the human body. Thanks to microgravity, astronauts experience a variety of health and physical changes while living in space \u2014 some of which they can counteract through daily exercise and other activities. But the space environment also exposes astronauts to other elements that cannot necessarily be mitigated.\nMost of these health changes stem from the fact that our bodies aren\u2019t built for space. Human beings have evolved here on Earth over millennia, so our bodies have adapted to excel in a gravity environment under the protection of our planet\u2019s atmosphere. In lower Earth orbit, however, those ubiquitous elements are taken away, and the body\u2019s various systems adapt accordingly.\nour bodies aren\u2019t built for space\nPerhaps the biggest change astronauts experience is bone and muscle loss. Humans on Earth work out these systems every day, simply by moving and standing against gravity. But without gravity to work against, the bones lose mineral density and the muscles risk atrophying. It\u2019s something astronauts are consistently trying to prevent from happening. \u201cWe try to minimize it as much as possible,\u201d says Bob Tweedy, the countermeasures systems instructor at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. To do that, astronauts on the station work out six out of seven days a week for 2.5 hours each day.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the International Space Station is equipped with three machines designed to give astronauts that full-body workout: a bicycle, a treadmill, and a weightlifting machine called ARED, for Advanced Resistive Exercise Device. Each machine is specially designed for space, since normal gym equipment would be useless in microgravity. Lifting weights, for instance, wouldn\u2019t do much in space since dumbbells wouldn\u2019t weigh anything. So instead, the ARED machine utilizes two canisters that create small vacuums that astronauts can pull against with a long bar. This allows them to do squats, bench presses, dead lifts, and more.\nthe ISS is equipped with three machines designed to give astronauts that full-body workout\nSimilarly, the station\u2019s treadmill is no ordinary running machine. Astronauts have to be strapped into it with a harness and bungee chords, otherwise they would float away and never actually get a workout. A stationary bicycle is also available for strengthening astronauts\u2019 legs, though it has no seat (since your butt wouldn\u2019t sit on it anyway). Instead, astronauts grip handles and sit up against a back pad to stay stationary.\nBut it\u2019s not just muscles and bones that astronauts have to worry about either. People also experience something call fluid shift in space. Without gravity pulling your bodily fluids downward, they shift up into the chest and head, causing issues with the circulatory system and even changes to vision. Most of these changes are temporary though and typically go away once astronauts return to Earth.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are harmful elements that astronauts are exposed to just simply by being outside of Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 the biggest of which is space radiation. Energetic particles from the Sun and outside our Solar Systems can travel through materials and skin, doing damage to the body over time. Fortunately, astronauts on the ISS are still shielded from a significant amount of space radiation thanks to Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which acts like a barrier around our planet. However, their exposure to radiation is monitored over the course of their careers, and NASA institutes lifetime limits for its astronauts so they don\u2019t experience too much.\nSpace radiation is going to be a concern for those traveling into deeper space, though, since astronauts will be outside Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cIf you spend most of your time on the space station, you're exposed to a different amount and quality of radiation than you would be, say, if you went into deep space,\u201d says Peter Guida, the liason biologist at NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Lab. \u201cYou might be able to do \u2014 these numbers are arbitrary \u2014 10 space stations missions versus one deep space mission. It really depends, but those things are carefully measured.\u201d\nNASA studies the effects of space radiation at a special lab at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island. There, Guida and other scientists use a particle accelerator to create simulated space radiation and see how it affects biological samples. \u201cInstead of bringing the samples up to the radiation, we bring the radiation down to the samples,\u201d he says. It\u2019s research that is helping NASA create better shielding that can mitigate radiation in space, potentially allowing astronauts to travel deeper into space than ever before.\n\n"}
