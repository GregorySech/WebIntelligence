{"title": "The Game of Game of Thrones: season 7, episode 1, Dragonstone", "content": " \nHere we are. The gang\u2019s all back in town, and it\u2019s time for another season of fights, hook-ups, and eviscerating burns. No, it\u2019s not Vanderpump Rules. It\u2019s the other one! \nForgive me for starting off this year\u2019s Game of Game of Thrones with an admission like this, but I spent the first several minutes of season 7 thinking we were seeing a flashback to a conversation happening in the Twins just after the Red Wedding, and in spite of myself, I hoped something unspeakable: \u201cAre they about to do Lady Stoneheart?\u201d\nI\u2019m embarrassed about that, but I think we should start the new GOGOT league from a place of honesty. It\u2019s never going to happen. I get it. I\u2019m sorry about my confusion over this, and over the fact that Arya\u2019s choice of poisonous wine, \u201cArbor Gold,\u201d is a red, not a white. The first scene of season 7 is a points monster, with Arya netting +50  for using magic to try on Walder Frey\u2019s dead body and hit the +50 points cap for random redshirt kills, effectively getting rid of what remained of the Frey family. She also delivers an icy (pardon me!) speech about the North. Cliffs Notes version: it still remembers, and \u201cWinter came for House Frey.\u201d (+10)  \nThe North still remembers\nThe North has been remembering for some time now (the writers blew it as an episode title five years ago, for some reason) and I\u2019m not convinced Arya\u2019s personal vendettas have much to do with what that phrase has come to mean on the show \u2014 i.e., that the old houses of the North remember their vows to the Starks, and will band together to defeat the Boltons. That, um, already happened. But it\u2019s nice to imagine all the thousands of Tumblr reblogs some lucky young GIF artist will get after they line up Sansa\u2019s season 6 slow walk and grin with Arya\u2019s. \nThis is a lovely death tableau. I wish there were points for artistry, and that director Jeremy Podeswa were a draftable player. (He gets +500 for this sequence. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s from another show.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nFrom there, this season premiere takes on the less-exhilarating but, yeah, necessary task of establishing the basic season 7 locations and job descriptions for all our major players. Bran and Meera make it to The Wall shortly after Bran has a gross vision (+20) of an army of wights crawling southward with some new additions \u2014 wight horses. Okay, sure. Zombie horses. I\u2019m so glad this show can get away with just about anything by way of looking very expensive all the time! \nThe new Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch \u2014 our guy, our sweet and loyal pal Edd Tollett \u2014 takes them in only after Bran says something ominous about Hardhome and this army of the dead. By the way, Edd looks sharp in Jon\u2019s clothes. Unfortunately, the GOGOT scoring system has been simplified, and I\u2019ve lost the ability to give points for good outfits. Sis, I\u2019m already feeling it. Anyway, now they\u2019re together, which is fun for exactly no one. Imagine getting a new job and then getting dealt Bran as your main co-worker for an entire year. Fuck. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nThis brings us to Winterfell, where Jon is organizing a dragonglass scavenger hunt in a hall full of Northern lords and assorted Team Jon dudes, and Sansa is silently rocking an extremely modern braid. When Jon starts saying a bunch of stuff that makes no sense, basically declaring that he\u2019s too Good and Pure to kick people who tried to murder him out of their houses, the only political strategist in the entire Stark family pipes up to remind him that he should punish treason and reward loyalty. Feel free to sound off in the comments, but Jon\u2019s facial expressions and flailing speech about Ned\u2019s declassified head-chopping guide made it seem to me like he knew Sansa was right, and was shutting her down purely out of spite. Either way, I suppose I have to reluctantly award him a +10 for \u201cI\u2019m the king. That is my decision, and my decision is final.\u201d \nJon is a disruptor, what do you want\nThis conversation, loosely inspired by an Uber board meeting, is a timeless portrait of misogyny at its most sinister, and I hope everyone who drafted Jon to their teams feels really bad about it.\nEven though this is a sibling rivalry scene in which not much is accomplished, we actually have quite a few points to give out. Sansa delivers a truly devastating own (+10) by asking Jon, \u201cJoffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?\u201d This backfires a little, as it hurts his feelings so much that she then has to spend a full two minutes complimenting him so he doesn\u2019t cry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon Snow, retire.\nImage: HBO\n\n\nThis meeting also results in a renewed vow of loyalty and some vague responsibilities for the very young (and undrafted in The Verge\u2019s league) Alys Karstark, who gets a generous +25 for her promotion to head of her house and friend of the \u201cKing,\u201d which I\u2019m comfortable with because I don\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll see her much after today. Lyanna Mormont gets, I suppose, a +10 for the seething note she gives Lord Glover: \u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to defend the North.\u201d (I\u2019m into the exchange of knowing looks between her and Brienne, but excuse me if I don\u2019t cheer for the creation of a child army.) Most significantly, Tormund Giantsbane and The Wildlings get +25 promotion points each for their new assignment guarding Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the castle nearest to Hardhome. RIP in advance to that guy, and +5 for \u201cI guess we\u2019re the Night\u2019s Watch now.\u201d I love a little ironic twist, and I love Tormund, who\u2019s toast. \nI know I can\u2019t do anything points-wise with this, but I did find it disturbing that Jon\u2019s main accomplishments in his first day as King in the North were sending his good friend to get killed by ice zombies, implementing a military state in which all children will be trained for war starting at age 10, and suggesting to his sister that she should please shut up forever. I know there\u2019s been a ton of fuss over the Mad Queen Theory, but I\u2019d just like to point out that Kit Harington himself told The Hollywood Reporter last week that Jon is \u201ca bit of a psychopath.\u201d\nTormund, I love you, I\u2019m sorry\nMeanwhile, Cersei is doing a whole lot of nothing much in King\u2019s Landing (+5 for wine), and we find her getting a huge new map of Westeros painted on the floor. It bothers me a little bit that she\u2019s walking on it while it\u2019s still in progress, but it really bothers Jaime that she doesn\u2019t want to talk about their \u201cbaby boy\u201d Tommen, who killed himself last year. For whatever reason, the mass murder she did shortly before that suicide does not come up, but Jaime does seem markedly less interested in Cersei\u2019s plan to take over the world than he was just a few episodes ago. When she declares her dominion over the Seven Kingdoms, he manages to quip back, \u201cThree kingdoms, at best.\u201d (+5)\nThat\u2019s all a bit of a bummer, but it\u2019s followed by my favorite scene of the episode, the debut of Hot Euron. Euron Greyjoy is in King\u2019s Landing with a whole fleet of cool ships that all have wildly unnecessary aesthetic features, and he\u2019s interested in marrying Cersei. Or in his words, \u201cHere I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.\u201d (+5) I can remember only the general thrust of his zinger-riddled overture to her (+5), distracted as I was by his eyeliner and absolutely bananas cosplay as the guy from Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d video, but we\u2019ll give him +5 for a bold come-on. He\u2019s off to find Cersei a \u201cpriceless gift,\u201d which I\u2019m assuming is Tyrion, and when he gets back, they\u2019ll likely get married, which I\u2019m assuming is how we\u2019ll see Jaime go fully rogue from Team Lannister. Hot Euron, already stirring up some shit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cool that Westeros has Hot Topic now.\nImage: HBO\n\n\nSpeaking of shit, Sam\u2019s in Oldtown, scooping it. That\u2019s his job now, and I\u2019m sorry to say that he gets a walloping -25 right out of the gate for this unfortunate demotion from \u201cReaderly guy who worries about his own personal development the majority of the time.\u201d It really is incredible that we can be more than 60 hours deep into this story, and still have cause for lengthy expository montages. This scene is basically the Stomp of soup and poop, and God bless this weird, weird show. Two questions: is this the darkest sequence in Game of Thrones history, and when will I be expected to sit through a remix of it?\nSam works for Archmaester Marwyn (Jim Broadbent!), who\u2019s just been added to the Game of Game of Thrones player pool, and he might even be a smart trade if he keeps it up with the speeches. His role in this premiere is to serve as the dissenting voice to the whole \u201cthe world is ending, the long night is coming, the army of the dead, etc.\u201d narrative, and to cooly remind Sam (with his hands fully inside a dead body), \u201cEvery winter that ever came has ended.\u201d Anyway, the main conflict in Oldtown is that Sam needs access to the hardcore library books, but unfortunately is not yet considered punk rock or philosophically jaded enough to handle them. \nSam is working on becoming a punk rock academic, but it\u2019s slow going\nBack at Winterfell, Littlefinger is trying to talk to Sansa about something \u2014 likely how essentially everything that has happened on this show is directly his fault \u2014 and she\u2019s not having it. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat do you want that you do not have?\u201d It\u2019s nauseatingly clear that he\u2019s hoping she says something like \u201cLove and companionship from a patchy-haired pedophile,\u201d but instead she says, \u201cAt the moment, peace and quiet.\u201d (+10)\nMeanwhile, somewhere in the woods, Arya stumbles upon Actual Ed Sheeran singing the song about Tyrion and Shae that the book-only character Symon Silver Tongue was killed for writing. She gets +5 for eating some of Ed\u2019s roast rabbit and swigging some ale to get through her conversation with him, then reveals that she\u2019s headed to King\u2019s Landing to kill Cersei. The sweet, big-hearted, summer souls who had been crossing their fingers for a Stark sister reunion are going to have to hold on a little longer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scene exists almost entirely to spotlight Actual Ed Sheeran, which offends me deeply. But it also gives us a little insight into the lives of random soldiers, who tell Arya that they have had lots of adventures, but really miss home, and do not know the sex or names of their own children. You can actually swap a scene from the 2013 One Direction documentary This is Us in at this point if you want. The episode will still make sense, and also Ed Sheeran won\u2019t be in it. \n\nFrom here, we go to a much more fun place: a snowstorm in the middle of nowhere! The Hound, Thoros of Myr, Beric Dondarrion, and the rest of the Brotherhood Without Banners are trudging around in the blizzard having emo conversations about the meaning of life and the powers of the Lord of Light, which normally wouldn\u2019t appeal to me, but Thoros and The Hound are a really fun duo. (\u201cWhy are you always in such a foul mood?\u201d \u201cExperience.\u201d) Their banter doesn\u2019t quite approach the point where I\u2019m ready to give out a slew of points yet, as it\u2019s regularly brought down by questions about why Beric is still alive and which god is real, but this is going to be fun. +5 to The Hound for calling out Thoros\u2019 man-bun. We\u2019ll start from there.\nThe Hound also nets some eating points (+5) and, impressively, some vision points (+20) for staring into the flames at Thoros\u2019 request and seeing an army of wights at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. (Tormund, I love you. You are loved.) I imagine we\u2019ll also be giving the Hound some \u201cadopting a new religion\u201d points soon, and though the Lord of Light went undrafted in The Verge\u2019s league this year, anyone who does have \u201chim\u201d on their roster gets a +20 for that vision as well. \nno points for really dumb breakthroughs \nAnd sure, another +5 to The Hound, whose only consistent character trait has been his fear of open flames, for \u201cIt\u2019s my fucking luck I wind up with a band of fire worshippers.\u201d That\u2019s the last you\u2019ll see of my generosity today, as the next scene takes us back to Oldtown, where Sam has stolen some of the secret books. One of them has a map of Dragonstone, which doesn\u2019t strike me as particularly confidential or scandalous information, but Sam is alarmed to find that the map depicts a \u201cmountain\u201d of dragonglass in the castle\u2019s basement. Stannis told him this before, but he didn\u2019t think it was important. Sorry, but there are no points for the incredibly dumb breakthrough of \u201cMaybe there\u2019s dragonglass at the ancestral home of the dragon guys,\u201d nor for traveling hundreds of miles to learn something you already knew, but forgot. \nTo round this scene out, Jorah\u2019s greyscale-covered arm shoots out of the wall of the Citadel, and he growls a question about \u201cthe dragon queen,\u201d like \u201cIs she here yet?\u201d Sam doesn\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t know how I resisted giving Jorah demotion points for becoming what is essentially an \u201880s haunted house jump-scare. \nFinally, Daenerys and crew arrive on the shores of Westeros, which are beautiful and totally unoccupied, and she rolls in (+25) as the new Lady of Dragonstone. A solid +25 to her dragons as well, the first official dragons of Westeros in hundreds of years. This scene is what we\u2019ve been waiting for 60 episodes, and I am with Dany even when she makes the melodramatic choice to kneel down and caress the sand. I am especially with her when she strides into the throne room (which someone has been dusting, I guess?) without even unpacking, and turns to her crew like, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d Hell yeah, and as I think I\u2019ve said: this is going to be fun. \nCheck your points on Fantasizr now\n\nThe Verge League Standings: \nMichael Zelenko: 115 points\nTop scorer: Arya Stark, 115\nSpecial team: The Royal Army, 0\nSarah Smithers: 60 points\nTop scorer: The Hound, 35\nSpecial team: Dragons, 25\nKwame Opam: 55 points\nTop scorer: Tormund Giantsbane, 30\nSpecial team: The Dothraki, 0\nAndy Hawkins: 25 points\nTop scorer: Euron Greyjoy, 15\nSpecial team: The Unsullied, 0\nTC Sottek: 25 points\nTop scorer: N/A\nSpecial team: Wildlings, 25 \nLiz Lopatto: 20 points\nTop scorer: Sansa Stark, 20\nSpecial team: The Old Gods, 0\nBryan Bishop: 10 points\nTop scorer: Lyanna Mormont, 10\nSpecial team: The Night\u2019s Watch, 0\nTasha Robinson: 5 points\nTop scorer: Jaime Lannister, 5\nSpecial team: White Walkers, 0\nChaim Gartenberg: 5 points\nTop scorer: Cersei Lannister, 5\nSpecial team: Wights, 0\nLoren Grush: -5 points\nTop scorer: Bran Stark, 20\nSpecial team: Brotherhood without Banners, 0\n\nLearning Game of Thrones theme song on a futuristic keyboard\n\n\n\n\nUpdate July 17th 9:00PM ET: This article was originally published on Jul 17, 2017, 9:09am and has been updated to include video.\n"}
