{"title": "One of the best email apps on iOS comes to Android", "content": " \nEmail by EasilyDo \u2014 currently my favorite email application on iOS \u2014 is now on Android. Like its iOS cousin, EasilyDo\u2019s Email app promises the same lightning speed, simple one-tap unsubscribing to junk mail, smart sorting for things like package tracking and flights, and swipe-based inbox triage tools that the sadly deceased Mailbox made popular. \nWhile Android doesn\u2019t have quite the same issue with email apps that iOS does with Apple\u2019s lackluster Gmail support in the bundled Mail app, Email by EasilyDo is still a great app if you\u2019re looking for a change from Google\u2019s own email app. Since its original introduction last year, EasilyDo has kept Email updated with support for Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, and other IMAP accounts, making it helpful if you\u2019re looking for a universal inbox. Even if you\u2019re not, its sheer speed when it comes to search and unsubscribing makes it at least worth a try.  \nEmail by EasilyDo is available now on the Play Store. \n"}
