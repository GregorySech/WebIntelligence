{"title": "Tesla updates Autopilot, Autosteer now works to 80 mph in new cars", "content": " \nTesla has updated its Autopilot software, bringing more advanced semi-autonomous driving capabilities to Tesla vehicles built since October 2016. That\u2019s when Tesla began including a more advanced sensor-suite in its Model S and Model X vehicles. Though while the hardware is more advanced, it\u2019s taken Tesla\u2019s engineers a few months to slowly roll out the capabilities of the companion software. \nThe end result was that buyers of new Tesla cars had vehicles with fewer features than older ones. But, with the release of Tesla Software 8.1 rolling out today, cars with the HW2 suite are gaining several new or updated features:\n\n\nLane Departure Warning. A steering wheel vibration alerts the driver when the car leaves its marked lane without a turn signal active.\n\nHigh Speed Autosteer (80 mph / 130 kph). It maintains the vehicle\u2019s position within a lane and allows the driver to briefly remove their hands from the wheel in some situations; it\u2019s now restricted to 80 mph and below on HW2, up from 45 mph. Tesla notes that Autosteer requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over at any time. \n\nAuto Lane Change. An Autosteer feature where the car can change lanes on its own when the driver activates the turn signal on a multi-lane road.\n\nSummon. The car can pull in and out of parking spaces, without a driver in the car, when a button is held on the key or the Tesla mobile app.\n\nNotably still missing from HW2 vehicles is automatic emergency braking, as well as automatic windshield wipers and high beam headlights.\nThere are a handful of other new features in Version 8.1, including the ability to reduce the default opening height of the falcon-wing doors in the Model X, an added ability to adjust the front-seat headrests, and the addition of user ratings and hours of operation to businesses in the navigation system. The new features are rolling out now to Tesla vehicles via an over-the-air software update.\n"}
