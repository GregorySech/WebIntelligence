{"title": "Google code hints at headphones that run Google Assistant", "content": " \nIs Google making a pair of headphones with its virtual assistant built-in? That seems to be what snippets of code in the latest version of the Google app (7.10) suggest. 9to5Google has sifted through the evidence and found a number of references in the app\u2019s APK to a mystery product, codenamed \u201cBisto.\u201d One line of code seems to spell out what Bisto could be: \u201cYour headphones have the Google Assistant. Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. It\u2019s your own personal Google, always ready to help.\u201d\nOf course, just because these lines of code appear in the Google app, it doesn\u2019t mean that the company will actually release a pair of Assistant-equipped headphones. But it\u2019s interesting to speculate. The code dug up by 9to5Google also mentions the ability to hear and reply to notifications using the headphones, as well as dedicated buttons for launching Assistant. \u201cTo talk to me or ask me a question, press and hold the Google Assistant button on the left earcup while talking,\u201d says one line of the code. We\u2019ll have to keep our ears to the ground for future developments. \n"}
