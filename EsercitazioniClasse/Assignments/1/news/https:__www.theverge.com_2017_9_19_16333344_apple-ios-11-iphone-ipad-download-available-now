{"title": "iOS 11 is now available to download", "content": " \nToday, Apple pushed out the final version of iOS 11, its latest mobile operating system release. Most iPhone and iPad units made in the last few years should be capable of downloading it now if you head over to the Settings panel and check for a software update under the General tab. For those who have been part of either the developer or public beta process, you\u2019ll likely already have the finalized iOS 11 and shouldn\u2019t need to do anything.\niOS 11, first unveiled in detail back at Apple\u2019s WWDC in June, is the same incremental annual refresh we\u2019ve come to expect from the company, but it hides some impressive complexity under the surface. Not only does it add some neat features to iOS for the first time, like ARKit capabilities for augmented reality and a new Files app, but it also comes with much-needed improvements to Siri; screenshot capture and editing; and the Control Center, which is now more fully featured and customizable. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n10 things to try after you install iOS 11\n\nFor iPads, iOS 11 is more of an overhaul. The software now better supports multitasking so you can more easily bring two apps into split-screen mode, or even add a third now. The new drag-and-drop features are also much more powerful on iPad, letting you manage stuff in the Files app more intuitively and even letting you drag and drop photos and text from one app to another. \nA lot of these features will need more fine-tuning and third-party developer support before they become central features most iOS users will enjoy. But they\u2019re strong steps toward further unifying Apple\u2019s mobile interfaces across screens of all shapes and sizes, helping iOS devices better compete against those with built-in keyboards. \n"}
