{"title": "Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Note 3 is a bigger, slower Mi 6", "content": " \nAlongside the Mi Mix 2 and Mi Notebook Pro, Xiaomi also announced the Mi Note 3 in Beijing today. But while it sounds like part of an entirely separate line, the Mi Note 3 is extremely similar to the Mi 6 announced earlier this year \u2014 it just has a bigger screen.\nThis runs in contrast to the Mi Note 2, whose Galaxy Note-inspired design was notably different to last year\u2019s Mi 5 flagship. And the Mi Note 3 isn\u2019t that much bigger \u2014 the screen is 5.5 inches versus the Mi 6\u2019s 5.15, which makes somewhat of a difference in the hand but isn\u2019t enough to make it feel like an entirely separate class of device like, say, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus does to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7.\nHere\u2019s how they look next to each other:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s a meaningful but not profound size disparity.\nAnd don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2014 Xiaomi literally calls it \u201ca Mi 6 with a larger screen\u201d: \n\n\nBut wait, that's not all! Introducing #MiNote3, a #Mi6 with a larger screen at 5.5\"! pic.twitter.com/F6jsZl0Gha\u2014 Mi (@xiaomi) September 11, 2017\n\n\n\nStill, the Mi 6 is a really good phone, and the Mi Note 3 might be a better bet if you prefer the screen size. I only say \u201cmight be\u201d because the processor has been downgraded a bit to the Snapdragon 660 from the Mi 6's 835. \nBut otherwise you're looking at the same dual 12 megapixel cameras with a secondary telephoto lens, the same 6GB of RAM, andthe same sleek design with four-sided glass back panel. The battery is appropriately bigger, however, at 3500mAh, and Xiaomi has also upgraded the front-facing camera to 16 megapixels complete with \u201cAdaptable AI\u201d beautifying modes.\nThe Mi Note 3 is available in China this week from 2,499 yuan (about $380) for a 64GB black model with 6GB of RAM, topping out at 2,999 yuan ($460) for a 128GB blue/gold model. That pricing is very close to that of the Mi 6, meaning you're basically trading a little bit of speed for a little bit of screen size.\n"}
