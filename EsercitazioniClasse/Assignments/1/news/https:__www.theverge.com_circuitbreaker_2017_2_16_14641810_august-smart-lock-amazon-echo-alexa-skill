{"title": "August suggests unlocking its voice-controlled lock when you're chopping onions and expecting guests", "content": " \nAugust announced today that its smart lock can now be locked and unlocked through Alexa-enabled devices. This is legitimately practical and good for people who are immobile, but August doesn\u2019t focus on that. No, instead, August wants us to remember  that this feature might work best for people who are too busy chopping onions to answer the door for their visitors. What the heck! That\u2019s so rude.\nSomeone else on the Verge staff informed me that this might also be good for people with three-story homes, which, sure. As a highly neurotic person, I could see voice lock being useful for when I\u2019m lying in bed worrying that I forgot to lock my door. This happens frequently. \nNow, obviously, there\u2019s a risk involved with anyone being able to tell Alexa to unlock a door, so to avoid that, each lock requires a user-created voice PIN to issue a command. Each pin has to be between four and 12 digits, and it\u2019s set up during the account linking process. Smart lock owners will also have to connect their lock to the internet through either the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge or August Doorbell Cam. \n\n"}
