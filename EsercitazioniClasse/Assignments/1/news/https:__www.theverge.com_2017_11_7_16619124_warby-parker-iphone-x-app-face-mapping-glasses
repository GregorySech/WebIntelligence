Some, like Animoji karaoke are more entertaining than useful, but others \u2014 like Warby Parker\u2019s new app \u2014 are a little more useful (as spotted by Joanna Stern on Twitter.) \nThe glasses company is cleverly using the iPhone\u2019s camera to take maps of people\u2019s faces, and use that data to recommend styles of glasses that will best fit your face. It\u2019s a step beyond the digital try on system the company has previously offered, where it would try to place a virtual pair of glasses on a picture to let you see how it looks. \n\n\nWarby Parker using the iPhone X TrueDepth camera is super super smart: pic.twitter.com/LgHpO8hfUx\u2014 Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) November 7, 2017\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty neat idea, although its hard not to see the potential that could be waiting in the wings here. Why stop at just using the facial recognition to recommend glasses, when you could do full augmented reality try ons, similar to how Snapchat does its face-mapped lenses? \nThe new feature is available on the Warby Parker app on iOS now, although it should go without saying that you\u2019ll need an iPhone X to take advantage of it. \n"}
