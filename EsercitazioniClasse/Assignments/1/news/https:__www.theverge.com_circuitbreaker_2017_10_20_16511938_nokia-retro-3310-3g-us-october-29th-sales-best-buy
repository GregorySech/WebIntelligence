{"title": "Nokia\u2019s retro 3310 3G is coming to the US for $60 on October 29th", "content": " The 3G version of Nokia\u2019s resurrected 3310 was announced in September as theoretically working in the US, unlike the 2G version released earlier this year. But at the time HMD Global, which owns the rights to Nokia phones, didn\u2019t say when  or even if  the 3310 3G would be coming to the US.Now, we know the answer to both of those questions: the phone is available for preorder starting today at Best Buy for $59.99, with the phone set to release on October 29th. If you\u2019re thinking about picking one up, be aware that it should work on AT&T and T-Mobile because both are GSM networks, but it won\u2019t work with Verizon and Sprint\u2019s CDMA ones. "}
