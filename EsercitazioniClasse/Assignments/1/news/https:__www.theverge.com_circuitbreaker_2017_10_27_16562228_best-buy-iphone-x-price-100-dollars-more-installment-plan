{"title": "Best Buy says charging people $100 more to buy an iPhone X is actually a good thing", "content": " \nIf you were preordering an iPhone X from Best Buy today, you might have noticed that the popular electronics retailer is charging an extra $100 on top of the already expensive $999 and $1,149 prices that Apple charges for the phones. \nDanielle Schumann, a spokesperson for Best Buy, tried to explain the fact that the company is overcharging for the iPhone X in a statement to Bloomberg, which is included in full below for the sheer ridiculousness of it.\n\u201cOur prices reflect the fact that no matter a customer\u2019s desired plan or carrier, or whether a customer is on a business or personal plan, they are able to get a phone the way they want at Best Buy. Our customers have told us they want this flexibility and sometimes that has a cost.\u201d\nSo, apparently Best Buy is under the impression that its customers would like to pay more to buy phones from it, as opposed to the cheaper retail cost offered everywhere else the iPhone X is sold. \nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the extra fee is only if you buy the iPhone X from Best Buy upfront; if you purchase the iPhone in installments from Best Buy, the price works out to the usual $999 and $1,149. You\u2019ll only see the $1,099 and $1,249 prices if you pay for the phone in full. It\u2019s a similar strategy to push customers toward an installment plan as the company\u2019s $100 discount on the Pixel 2, but instead of giving customers a discount on the installment plan, its giving everyone who doesn\u2019t use the monthly option a more expensive price. \n"}
