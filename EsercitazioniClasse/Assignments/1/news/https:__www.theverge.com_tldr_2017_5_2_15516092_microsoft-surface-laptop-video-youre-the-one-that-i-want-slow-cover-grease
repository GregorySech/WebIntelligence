{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop video features a slowed-down cover of the Grease soundtrack", "content": " \nMicrosoft just announced the Surface Laptop, and, as is tradition in the tech industry, the announcement was accompanied by a fancy \u201cmaking of\u201d video unveiling the device by showcasing the various (stylized) parts of the manufacturing process. The video is pretty cool, but I\u2019m here to talk about the soundtrack: a bizarrely slowed-down (and slightly creepy) cover of \u201cYou\u2019re the One That I Want\u201d from the finale of Grease.\nLook, I get what Microsoft was going for here. The company is hoping that, just like Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson, you will similarly recognize a new Surface Laptop as \u201cthe one that you want.\u201d The fact that lines like \u201cthe power you\u2019re supplying is electrifying\u201d also can apply to a laptop (I guess?) in addition to the intended subject of young love is probably an added bonus. \n\nBut it\u2019s just plain weird to hear the song slowed down to the dramatic, soulful rendition that Microsoft\u2019s commercial features, given the extensive cultural weight attached to the song by, you know, Grease. Even stranger, it\u2019s not the first time a brand has sucked the joy out of the Grease finale for a haunting cover version! Chanel did it, too with a similar version by singer Lo-Fang in 2014 for a N\u00b05 perfume ad. \n\nThat said, the move is right in line with a trend in modern movie trailers: taking upbeat pop songs and turning them into moody, slo-mo covers for more weighty drama. It puts Microsoft\u2019s cover in a list that includes, but is certainly not limited to: 50 Shades of Grey\u2019s cover of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy In Love,\u201d 10 Cloverfield Lane and \u201cI Think We\u2019re Alone Now,\u201d Avengers: Age of Ultron with \u201cThere Are No Strings On Me,\u201d The Social Network with Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep,\u201d and many, many others.\nHowever, I do have to admit: even slowed down and overly moody, it\u2019s still pretty catchy. \n\n\nI fixed the music in Microsoft's Surface Laptop announcement video. pic.twitter.com/n3roe92V8A\u2014 Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) May 2, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
