{"title": "Why don\u2019t more smartwatches have a flashlight?", "content": " \nAcer announced a lot of new products today: powerful gaming laptops, fancy monitors to go with them, and even a 360-degree camera that can make voice calls. One item on that list was the Leap Ware smartwatch. Now, I don\u2019t want to be mean without giving this thing a fair shot, but my initial impressions weren\u2019t the best. The watch\u2019s proprietary software felt sluggish, the display is fairly dim and difficult to read, and the design itself won\u2019t appeal to everyone. But the Leap Ware does have at least one clever trick in its feature set: there\u2019s an LED flashlight built in. \nThe product demo tables were outside in the Manhattan daylight, so I couldn\u2019t get a good sense of how bright the LED gets in the dark. Acer says it\u2019s good for things \u201clike unlocking your front door late at night\u201d and can be used as a safety measure if you\u2019re running outside at night. But integrating a flashlight inside at least some wearables is an idea I can get behind. Sure, there are practicality obstacles. Smartwatch batteries are tiny. What if you wear your watch on your right wrist? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer\u2019s Leap Ware smartwatch.\n\n\nAnd yes, pretty much every smartphone has this function nowadays, but you don\u2019t always have your phone in your hand or in your pocket when you need a quick beam of light to help find something \u2014 like last night when I was lying on the floor trying to find my Apple TV remote underneath the couch. I\u2019m not sure Acer\u2019s watch flashlight would\u2019ve been powerful enough to illuminate the abyss down there, but I like the idea. It could work in tighter spaces, and I\u2019d probably use the thing more often than I\u2019d make calls from my wrist. There\u2019s potential, even if we only reserve this feature for the wearables that own their ugliness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t say everything about this watch is perfect.\n\n\n"}
