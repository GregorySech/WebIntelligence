Eliot used to say, messing around with the \u201cobjective correlative.\u201d In his opinion, if you felt too much while reading a poem, it was because the language therein was Way Too Floral, and also you were probably a woman. If you weren\u2019t feeling enough, it was because there weren\u2019t enough Facts or Metaphors. \nThis is why he hated the famous play Hamlet.\nI\u2019m simplifying years of painstaking and unnecessary literary criticism to make a point here: a mash-up of famous Vine clips set to the \u201cBlessings\u201d reprise from Chance the Rapper\u2019s third mixtape, Coloring Book, has moved me to tears at my desk. \n\n\nI still miss Vine. pic.twitter.com/KTPNe12HBR\u2014 Internet Shaquille (@netshaq) February 20, 2017\n\n\n\nIf T.S. Eliot were editing this moment in my life, he would say it makes no sense and isn\u2019t supported by the facts of the story. \u201cThere are lots of less silly things to cry about!\u201d he would shout. \u201cShe\u2019s an adult!\u201d he would say, convincing no one. Unfortunately, it\u2019s really happening, and that is part of why we should remember T.S. Eliot less fondly than we do. Also, he abandoned his wife (also his editor and The Wasteland co-writer), told his friends she was crazy, then pretended not to know who she was when she finally found him at a New York City book signing two years later. \nit\u2019s not silly to cry, imo\nThe Twitter app Vine, as you might recall, has been dead since late October of last year.  Some see this as a tragedy. This imbues the video with the poignancy of an award show \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment even though it is, of course, just a tribute video to an app that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Adding to the effect: the Vines selected for the clip line up fairly well with the words to the song, which makes sense because Chance the Rapper is one of the best visual lyricists of our time.\nAt the end of the video, its creator points out that Vine (\u201cthe good app\u201d) was \u201cmurdered by Twitter for not making enough money.\u201d That statement is followed by an incriminating graph of Twitter\u2019s stock value over time. Here\u2019s the updated version of that graph as of this afternoon: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Google News\n\n\nWhich part of the video is your favorite? Is it that Twitter burn, enabled by Google search and the screenshot tool? Is it \u201cdo it for the Vine,\u201d the cutest six seconds in film history? Is it the part where Chance the Rapper says \u201cI speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood / Make you remember how to smile good\u201d while a puppy smiles? \nFor me it\u2019s the part where two teens jump into a lake while Chance says \u201codyssey.\u201d It just vibes with me, and I can\u2019t explain it. Neither can T.S. Eliot, both because he\u2019s dead and because he didn\u2019t totally think women were human beings. \n"}
