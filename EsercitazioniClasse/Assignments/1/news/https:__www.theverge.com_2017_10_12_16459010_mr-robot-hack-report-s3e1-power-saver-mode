{"title": "The Mr. Robot Hack Report: Minesweeper and a fake stolen car", "content": " \nMr. Robot is back, and the C Y B E R is back, too. The show takes a special interest in showing off the details that usually get glossed over, often drawing on real hacks and real cybersecurity problems. So after every episode, I\u2019ll be breaking down who got hacked, how, and with what. It turns out, there\u2019s a lot more to each one than you can see on-screen.\nWe\u2019re back! After a year away, Mr. Robot is coming back with a bang. Tyrell has literally gone underground, Elliot is souring on his anti-corporate crusade, and the world overall continues to fall apart. And it\u2019s only 2015!\nAs season 3 picks up, Elliot has recovered from his episode-ending gunshot wound, just in time to resume the ongoing struggle within his own psyche, which may well determine the fate of capitalism. The battle lines are drawn, and power has been restored. We even got a dramatic putting-on-the-hoodie moment! Now let\u2019s get to the hacks.\nSWEEPING FOR MINES\nThis week saw Mr. Robot\u2019s first full hacking tournament, a techno-themed basement rave that might be the first Capture the Flag tournament we\u2019ve ever seen on TV. Elliot and Darlene are interested because this is the only hacker space in New York with a direct fiber connection. (In the Mr. Robot timeline, as in reality, Verizon has failed to meet its municipal franchise obligations.) But since they need the space to clear out, Elliot steps in to solve the challenge early, basically whispering the answer to a nearby hacker as if he were laying out a checkmate.\nIt\u2019s not as easy as it looks on TV\nCompetitions like this are a very real and popular part of hacker culture. They\u2019re called \u201ccapture the flag\u201d games because of the balance between offense and defense: you have to balance your team\u2019s resources between exploiting bugs on the opponent\u2019s network, and protecting your own. The biggest CTF tournaments happen at Defcon, but there are smaller ones throughout the year. In fact, the specific game they\u2019re playing \u2014 breaking into a web-hosted version of the game Minesweeper, while hosting their own \u2014 is based on a real game that was played at the Chaos Communication Congress in 2012. You can see the challenge here, and check out a bunch of the solutions. Fair warning: it\u2019s not as easy as it looks on TV!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIRI, STOP THE CAR\nWeirdly, my favorite hack of the week came from Bobby Cannavale\u2019s Irving, the Dark Army fixer and barbecue enthusiast who has turned out to be one of season 3\u2019s biggest surprises. Escaping from the hacker space with Elliot and Darlene, Irving spots an FBI agent tailing them, and manages to slow the car to a stop just by talking on the phone. There\u2019s a lot going on at once here. Irving is impersonating a cop, running the car\u2019s license plate against a DMV lookup tool to work backward to its Vehicle Identification Number. Then he uses that to identify the car to a dispatcher and shut it down.\nA rev limiter can force the engine to idle\nThe important thing here is that the car has OnStar, which includes something called a rev-limiter. If OnStar thinks your car has been stolen, the company can use that rev limiter to force the engine to idle, at which point the car rolls to a stop so the police can swing by and pick it up. In practice, this tends to happen through GPS coordinates rather than VINs, but the basic hack here is very plausible.\nYou may remember, Irving says, \u201cI see the lights blinking\u201d right before the FBI car stalls out. That\u2019s drawn from real life, too: OnStar will often typically flash the lights before a slowdown to confirm with the officer that they\u2019ve taken control of the right car.\nYou might think a remote shutdown switch is a bad thing to have in a police car, but General Motors, which makes both OnStar and a ton of police cars, actually seems pretty excited about marketing the service to cops. It\u2019s always possible there\u2019s some secret cop-switch that you could flip to disable the rev-limiter, but since the shutdown request usually goes through the police office itself, it doesn\u2019t seem like a huge problem in real life.\nONE LAST THING\nIf you were watching closely during that scene in the basement with Tyrell, Mr. Robot, and Angela, you might have seen an up-close monitor shot of a hackery-looking website. The narrative point was to confirm that E-Corp still has a vulnerability, and Mr. Robot\u2019s plan for Stage Two is still viable \u2014 but the website itself is still very much a thing. It\u2019s called Shodan.io, and it keeps a running tab on all the devices connected to the internet. A lot of them are Internet-of Things devices like web cameras and smart doorbells, and a lot of them are completely unsecured \u2014 which is a big part of why it\u2019s so important to keep tabs on this stuff. It\u2019s not just for evil hackers, I swear.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all the hacks for this week, but we talk about all that and more on the Mr. Robot Digital After Show, which you can see above. We still don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with Dom, or what any of the weird alternate timeline stuff is about. Let me know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019re wondering about, by email, on Reddit, or by tweeting at us with the hashtag #RobotAfterShow.
