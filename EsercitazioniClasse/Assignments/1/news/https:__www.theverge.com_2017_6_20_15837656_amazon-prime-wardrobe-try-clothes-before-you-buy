{"title": "Amazon Prime Wardrobe will let you try on clothes before you buy them", "content": " \nAmazon is launching Prime Wardrobe, a new program that will let you try on clothes before you buy them. Once you select at least three Prime Wardrobe-eligible pieces from over a million clothing options, Amazon will ship your selections to you in a resealable return box with a prepaid shipping label.\n\nAfter you try on the clothes, you can put the ones you don\u2019t want back in the box and leave it at your front door \u2014 Prime Wardrobe also comes with free scheduled pickups from UPS. If you decide to keep at least three items you will get a 10 percent discount off your purchase, and if you keep five or more pieces the discount rises to 20 percent.\nThis is Amazon Fashion\u2019s latest attempt to grow its retail footprint \u2014 Amazon launched the Echo Look \u201cstyle assistant\u201d back in May, and it began working with celebrities like Dwyane Wade to build out mini stores on its website. Given Amazon\u2019s history of entering and methodically dominating retail markets (see: books, electronics, and probably groceries), this likely isn\u2019t the last move we\u2019ll see from Amazon Fashion this year.\nAmazon Prime Wardrobe is currently in beta, but you can sign up to get notified when it officially launches.\n"}
