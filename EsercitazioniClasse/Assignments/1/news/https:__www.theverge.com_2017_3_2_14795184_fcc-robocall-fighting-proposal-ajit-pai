{"title": "FCC chairman Pai lays out this month\u2019s agenda, with fighting robocalls at the top", "content": " \nFCC chairman Ajit Pai has laid out the commission\u2019s agenda for the coming month, and the big item on the list is a proposal to combat robocalls.\nThe FCC made a major update to its robocall rules back in 2015 that allowed phone service providers to start offering blocking tools to stop subscribers from receiving spammy calls. This month\u2019s measure would explore ways to expand what companies can do, particularly by allowing them to block certain spoofed calls and calls from numbers that don\u2019t actually exist.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hopefully take an important step toward combating this scourge.\u201d\nPai says robocalls are \u201cthe top source of consumer complaints to the FCC\u201d and points out that they\u2019re often scams. \u201cThis month, we\u2019ll hopefully take an important step toward combating this scourge,\u201d he writes in a blog post.\nOther proposals this month include updates to rules around video relay services, which assist calls for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and a proposal to let prisons and jails block cellphone signals, to prevent the use of contraband phones.\nOn the other end of this month\u2019s spectrum is a proposal that would ease reporting requirements for telecom providers, so that they no longer have to provide an annual report on their traffic and revenue from international services. The commission says these reports are \u201cno longer necessary given the competitive nature of the international telecommunications sector.\u201d\nThis is in line with the more controversial actions Pai has taken, which generally involve removing FCC oversight from telecom companies and trusting them to behave.\nThere are six items announced in total for this month\u2019s commission meeting. And this month, Pai is publishing the text of all six items \u2014 expanding the transparency measures he began last month. (Orders typically aren\u2019t published until close to a month after they\u2019re voted on.)\nPai says \u201cthe initial stage of the pilot project was a success\u201d and that the FCC \u201creceived overwhelmingly positive feedback from the public.\u201d After this month, Pai says the commission will have enough feedback to \u201cfully evaluate\u201d options to set up permanent procedures for how and when to release new orders and proposals.\nFor the most part, Pai is right that his transparency measures have been well received. Though there have been some concerns, the general feeling is that providing more information to the public is a good thing. However Democrats have argued that Pai isn\u2019t being totally open about his own actions and has done quite a bit already without consulting the rest of the commission \u2014 just last week, for instance, he said he would halt internet privacy rules on his own if the commission didn\u2019t make an emergency vote (eventually, it did).\nThis month\u2019s measures will be voted on during a meeting on March 23rd.\n"}
