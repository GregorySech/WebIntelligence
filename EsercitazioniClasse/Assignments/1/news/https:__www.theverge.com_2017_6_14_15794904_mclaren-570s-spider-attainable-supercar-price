{"title": "McLaren\u2019s new 570S Spider is its \u2018most attainable\u2019 supercar", "content": " \nEveryone loves a good supercar: gorgeous, aerodynamic, laughably out of reach for almost everyone on the planet. We love to drool over photos of these cars, fully aware that we\u2019ll probably never drive one. McLaren wants to change that perception with the release of the 2018 570S Spider, calling it the \u201cmost attainable\u201d sports car ever. \nThis model is the third body type in McLaren\u2019s Sport series portfolio, which includes the 570S Coupe and the 570GT. (We last saw the 570S Coupe at the 2015 New York Auto Show, and were appropriately bowled over by it.) The 570S Spider will make its global debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which will be held in the UK June 29th\u2013July 2nd.\nThe 570S Spider is motivated by a 562-horsepower, 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. The 0\u201360 mph comes in 3.1 seconds with a top speed of 204 mph. Those acceleration specs are a fraction slower than the 675LT Spider, but identical to the 570S Coupe. One of the neatest features is the 570S Spider\u2019s retractable, hardtop roof that takes 15 seconds to open or close and can be engaged at vehicle speeds of up 25 mph. Top speed with the top down is 196 mph, so hang on to your hat. \nMcLaren says the first 400 units of the 570S Spider will be \u201claunch edition models,\u201d and will be priced at $208,000 each. That\u2019s almost $200,000 less than the 675LT Spider and $120,000 less than the 650S Spider. So attainable! The convertible comes in two colors: \u201cSicilian Yellow\u201d and \u201cVega Blue.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
