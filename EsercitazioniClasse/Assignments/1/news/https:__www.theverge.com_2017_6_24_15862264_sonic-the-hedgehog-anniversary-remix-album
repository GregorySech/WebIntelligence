{"title": "Relive Sonic the Hedgehog\u2019s glory days with this eclectic remix album", "content": " \n2017 is shaping up to be a big year for Sonic. Later this year, we will see the launch of two new games starring the iconic Sega character, including both the old-school Sonic Mania, and the more modern (and 3D!) Sonic Forces. With all of this going on, you may well be in the mood for a Sonic fix right now. Well, there\u2019s good news: this week, video game music collective Overclocked Remix released a fantastic celebration of the series\u2019s long musical history.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nSonic Mania and Sonic Forces show Sega's wildly differing views on its flagship franchise\nTalking to the man behind Sonic the Hedgehog's incredible Twitter\n\n\nCalled Speeding Towards Adventures: 25 Years of Sonic the Hedgehog, the new album features 23 classic Sonic tracks, remixed and reimagined by 30 different artists. As with all of the many OC Remix projects \u2014 which include everything from a jazz-inspired Chrono Trigger album to a sprawling, multi-part Final Fantasy V tribute \u2014 Speeding Towards Adventures features an eclectic range of musical styles. It starts with the thumping \u201cGotta Start From Somewhere\u201d (complete with a twist on the \u201cSega!\u201d opening jingle), before moving on to more serene sounds like \u201cThe Power of Choices.\u201d\n\u201cMy vision for this project was to be simple: I wanted to cover as many games as possible as well as to represent a variety of musical genres to represent the variety of Sonic's journeys,\u201d explains co-director Stepan \"Black_Doom\" Sudilovsky. The collection manages to strike a balance between nostalgia and surprise. You can check out the entire thing now, for free.\n"}
