{"title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\u2019s Despacito is the most-streamed track of all time", "content": " \nSince its release in January, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\u2019s \u201cDespacito\u201d has racked up a total of 4.6 billion streams, making it the most-streamed song of all time. The record includes streams from the \u201cDespacito\u201d remix featuring Justin Bieber, which was released in April. The global streaming numbers come from \u201call major platforms,\u201d including Spotify and YouTube, The Guardian reports. \nThe track surpasses Justin Bieber\u2019s 2015 track \u201cSorry,\u201d which held the previous all-time streaming record with 4.38 billion plays. \u201cDespacito\u201d accumulated most of its streams on YouTube, where the original video has more than 2.6 billion streams, and the official remix stream on Fonsi\u2019s channel has more than 400 million streams. On Spotify, the tracks have a combined total of around 1 billion streams, according to Business Insider.\n\n\u201cStreaming has opened up the possibility of a song with a different beat, from a different culture and in a different language to become a juggernaut of success around the world,\u201d Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge said in a statement to Variety.\nFonsi and Daddy Yankee earned this title in record time: just six months. But \u201cDespacito\u201d has a couple things going for it. It\u2019s a truly global hit, and the first song with largely Spanish lyrics to reach the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1996\u2019s \u201cMacarena.\u201d And it spent 10 weeks in that spot. \nThe song also had a second explosion, particularly in the United States, when Justin Bieber, who has already proven his capacity to break records, added a verse.  \n"}
