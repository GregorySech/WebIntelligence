{"title": "How to trigger Spotify\u2019s creepy Stranger Things Easter egg", "content": " In honor of Stranger Things\u2019 upcoming second season, which premieres this Friday on Netflix, Spotify has hidden a spooky little gem in its web player: a re-skin that turns the black-and-green media player into The Upside Down. It won\u2019t affect the music you\u2019re playing, but it will add some floating spores and a flashlight beam to make your listening experience a little creepier.Triggering the Easter egg is pretty simple: pull up your Spotify account on either the browser or app, start the Stranger Things soundtrack for either season, and let it play. Wait a few seconds, and you\u2019ll enter the home of the Demogorgon. If you move your mouse or browse around Spotify, however, it\u2019ll disappear. Neither me nor my colleagues were able to activate it on the desktop app, though several readers have had better luck. It also only applies to the Stranger Things soundtracks \u2014 sadly, I could not get Drake to take the plunge \u2014 and Spotify only supports specific browsers, like Chrome. Nevertheless, it is Halloween season, and who doesn\u2019t appreciate a little visual panache with their moody playlists? Thanks, Ben Krogh!Update: Added additional information about desktop app functionality. "}
