{"title": "Game of Thrones: 5 things to know before the premiere", "content": " \nThe seventh season of HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones is set to premiere this Sunday, July 16th. The show has been steadily building in popularity over the course of its run, with the season 6 finale breaking the show\u2019s previous viewership records, and conversation about each new episode taking over social media and media sites. It\u2019s been more than a year since the last episode aired, and given a cast of hundreds of players, and events crisscrossing a continents-spanning map, even the most dedicated fans may want a refresher course on where the story left off. So without further ado, here are the top five things to remember about season 6:\nSpoilers ahead for season 6 of Game of Thrones.\n1) Jon Snow survived a series of stabbings\nJon Snow was murdered at the end of season 5, and resurrected at the beginning of season 6 by the Red Woman, Melisandre. He reunited with Sansa Stark, who ran away from her abusive marriage to Ramsay Bolton and begged Jon to challenge the Boltons for control of Winterfell, where Jon and Sansa were raised as siblings. Jon was initially reluctant to declare war, but he successfully defeated the Boltons in a battle that took an enormous effort, and left Sansa\u2019s brother Rickon dead and Jon beaten within an inch of his life. In recognition of his accomplishments, Jon was crowned King in the North. His status has been recognized by several formerly Stark-allied Northern families, the Wildlings he helped rescue from north of the Wall, the men of the Night\u2019s Watch, and Lyanna Mormont, the little-girl general from Bear Island with only 62 soldiers.\n2) Most of the main characters in King\u2019s Landing were burned with wildfire\nCersei Lannister mass-murdered most of King\u2019s Landing by burning everyone with wildfire, including fan-fave Margaery Tyrell, most of her kin, a couple of Lannisters, and also the annoying High Sparrow. This backfired on her when her youngest son, Tommen, committed suicide upon finding out his wife Margery was dead. RIP our gentlest king and Cersei\u2019s last living child. Now Cersei is childless and an orphan, and when we last saw her, she claimed the Iron Throne. We can only anticipate more acts of violence from her in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, Olenna, Margaery\u2019s grandmother, is safely in Dorne, plotting away with Varys (representing Daenerys\u2019 interests) and Ellaria (representing the Martells) against the Lannisters, which brings us to our next point...\n3) Daenerys set sail for the Iron Throne\nDaenerys Targaryen has finally sailed for Westeros, with her three dragons and Tyrion Lannister in tow, as the new Hand of the Queen. Daenerys has also secured an alliance with Ironborn Yara Greyjoy, who is determined to reclaim the Iron Islands from her uncle, who seized them after he murdered her father. After seasons upon seasons of Daenerys ruling lands in the East and not making any headway in her attempt to reclaim the Iron Throne, which was once ruled by her father, the \u201cMad King,\u201d she finally boards a westward ship in the season 6 finale! About time. \n4) Stark sibling savagery\nAfter seasons of assassin training and being forced to renounce her identity, Arya Stark finally overcame the House of Black and White and traveled back to Westeros. In one of season 6\u2019s greatest moments, Arya killed Walder Frey after serving him a pie baked out of his sons\u2019 dismembered parts, eliminating them from her long revenge list. Also on that list: Cersei Lannister. In another great revenge scene, Sansa Stark let Ramsay Bolton\u2019s dogs eat him alive, getting vengeance for her abusive marriage and Rickon\u2019s murder.\n5) Bran is the next Three-Eyed Raven\nSeason 6 featured a lot of screwups on Bran\u2019s part, including accidentally giving Hodor brain damage and a permanently limited vocabulary while making Hodor\u2019s life\u2019s goal to hold the door against an army of wights. Also, Bran maybe had a hand in making the Mad King go mad. But his unfortunate failures have only earned him more magical powers and responsibility. At the end of season 6, he assumed his magical seer role as the next Three-Eyed Raven, replacing the old man fused inside a tree who held the title previously, and returning to his visions of the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: HBO\n\n\nBonus things to remember:\n\nThe status of Benjen Stark has been revealed \n\nBenjen went missing in the beginning of season 1, and numerous characters have referenced him throughout the show. At one point, he was used to lure Jon Snow to his temporary death. At the end of season 6, Benjen saved Bran Stark and his companion Meera, then explained that the White Walkers left him for dead. But the Children of the Forest saved him from turning into a wight by jamming a piece of dragonglass into his heart. He is officially undead, so he can\u2019t leave the north. \n\n Sam went to college\n\nSamwell Tarly has reached a massive library in Oldtown, where he can now do more research. This is one of those plotlines that haven\u2019t paid off yet, but it could lead to discoveries and more exploration into the White Walkers.\n\nJon Snow\u2019s origins were finally explained\n\nConfirming fan theories, as the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran witnessed a vision of Lyanna Stark holding a newborn son, fathered by Lyanna\u2019s captor, Rhaegar Targaryen. Lyanna entrusted the boy to Ned Stark, who raised him as his own, and who we now realize is Jon Snow. The R+L=J theory is canon, meaning Jon is Daenerys\u2019 nephew. That might mean the two of them don\u2019t get the happy romantic ending fans have suggested was going to be the final happy ending to Game of Thrones. Season 7 will probably clarify the situation between them, as they either embrace their family connections; murder each other, destroying everyone\u2019s hopes and dreams; or weirdly but still possible, get married as a strategic alliance of their armies. Guess which one of those endings sounds more like Game of Thrones?\n"}
