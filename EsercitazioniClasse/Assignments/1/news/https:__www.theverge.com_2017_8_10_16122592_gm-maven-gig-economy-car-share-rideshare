{"title": "GM expands its car sharing service for Uber and Lyft drivers", "content": " \nMaven Gig, the car-sharing service for gig economy workers owned by General Motors, is expanding to a few more cities. Starting today, the service is available in Los Angeles. Later this fall, it will launch in Boston, Phoenix, and Washington, DC. And Baltimore and Detroit will follow soon after. \nThe program is aimed at drivers for rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft, and delivery apps like Postmates, GrubHub, and InstaCart. Someone who\u2019s interested in driving for any of these on-demand services, but doesn\u2019t own a vehicle, can rent a Chevy Bolt through Maven Gig for $229-a-week. The weekly price includes insurance, maintenance, and electric vehicle charging.\n170 million miles\nMaven first launched its gig worker product last May in San Diego and San Francisco. Since then, Maven says its customers have logged 170 million miles driving for various on-demand apps. \nJust last November, Maven announced that it was partnering with Uber in San Francisco on a 90-day pilot program. Drivers could take out GM vehicles for $179 a week plus additional taxes and fees to earn money on the ride-sharing platform. The deal raised more than a few eyebrows at the time considering GM was a major investor in Uber\u2019s main rival, Lyft.\nPresently, there are a handful of options available to someone who wants to make money as a gig economy driver but doesn\u2019t own a vehicle. Uber has a partnership with Enterprise Rent-a-Car in Denver, while Lyft, GM, and Hertz have a rental service called \u201cExpress Drive\u201davailable in 19 cities. (Uber just recently decided to scrap its auto leasing business after higher-than-projected losses.) All offer discounted prices to freelance drivers.\nWhen it launched in January 2016, GM said that Maven would be its new \u201cpersonal mobility brand,\u201d reflecting a trend in the auto industry of spinning off new, millennial-friendly businesses as a hedge against perceived declines in personal car ownership. Since then, Maven has grown to 17 cities in the US and Canada, boasting 35,000 members who have made more than 45,000 reservations. Maven says that users in 11 of those cities have reported using the car-sharing service to make money driving for companies like Uber and Lyft.\n"}
