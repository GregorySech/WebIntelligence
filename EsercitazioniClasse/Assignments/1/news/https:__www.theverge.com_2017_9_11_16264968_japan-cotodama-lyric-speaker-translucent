{"title": "This translucent Japanese speaker displays animated lyrics", "content": " \nJapanese company COTODAMA recently made its visual lyric speaker available in the US, and the device features translucent screens that display a song\u2019s lyrics as it plays. COTODAMA says it\u2019s \u201cthe first lyrical listening speaker available to the public.\u201d\nFirst released in Japan last year, the COTODAMA Lyric Speaker features slick, minimal-looking housing made of translucent TFT LCD panels sandwiched between acrylic. There are two speakers on the front with a volume knob, and a circular disc on the back that holds the computer generating the displayed lyrics and graphics. Handmade in Japan, only 15 COTODAMA speakers are produced each month.\nWhen music plays on the speaker, the back panel turns a milky white, and the front displays animated lyrics. The speaker\u2019s technology is linked with SyncPower Corporation (PetitLyrics), Japan\u2019s largest lyrics database. Once it recognizes a song, it analyzes the mood and its \u201cexpression engine\u201d chooses fonts and animations accordingly. A slow love song, for example, might be interpreted with a delicate font that drifts across the speaker. If no lyrics are found, or an instrumental song is played, the speaker shows abstract graphics that animate in sync with the music. Regardless of what it shows, the overall effect is modern, eye-popping, and just plain cool.\nThe speaker analyzes a song\u2019s mood, and its \u201cexpression engine\u201d chooses fonts and animations accordingly\nNaturally, the speaker has an app to control it, which strangely only supports Wi-Fi and not Bluetooth. Since this isn\u2019t something you\u2019d likely be carting around, it\u2019s not a big deal that it can\u2019t connect solely to your smartphone, but it is a weird omission. If you\u2019re using Android, only the Lyric Speaker app and Spotify are compatible, but the iOS version also supports Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play, SoundCloud, Youtube, and other services.\nAs far as performance, the speaker can play 96khz/24bit FLAC files, has a range of 40Hz to 40kHz, and has two coaxial loudspeakers and two drone cones.\nCOTODAMA\u2019s lyric speaker is available now for $4,500 on fancy.com, and if you\u2019re waffling on spending that much, they\u2019re offering one-on-one Skype video demos to show it off.\n"}
