{"title": "Evernote adds support for the MacBook Pro\u2019s Touch Bar", "content": " \nEvernote is the latest Mac app to add support for the Touch Bar, and it seems to be taking a pretty simple approach to it.\nAfter a new update, the Touch Bar will display buttons to start a search, begin a new note, and access tags \u2014 all things that you may actually want to do with just a tap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Evernote\n\n\nControls get a bit more complicated in specific instances \u2014 the bar turns into a slider when choosing colors, and it pulls out a suite of markup tools for images \u2014 but they don\u2019t appear to get into the overly complicated realm that bogs down some apps\u2019 Touch Bar controls.\nEvernote specifically says it was trying to make its controls fall somewhere between touchscreen buttons and keyboard shortcuts, so it makes sense to see it land on this kind of basic result.\nMajor Mac apps have been slowly rolling out support for the Touch Bar over the past few months as the laptops end up in more and more peoples\u2019 hands. The password manager 1Password added support last year, and Microsoft updated Office with support in February. Apple has also been adding Touch Bar support to even more of its own apps, including Logic.\n"}
