{"title": "The Emoji Movie is so bad, it made us yell at strangers on the street", "content": " \nIn The Emoji Movie, a malfunctioning Meh emoji named Gene (T.J. Miller) escapes from a text app so he can be reprogrammed (and subsequently saved from deletion) by an infamous hacker. He travels though a teenager's smartphone with a washed-up High-Five emoji (James Corden) who hopes the hacker can make him popular again. \nWe went to see The Emoji Movie at 9:30AM at a Times Square movie theater, just so the experience would be a little bit worse than it had to be. We don\u2019t recommend you see the movie, but we do recommend you understand it, for your own protection. With that in mind, we\u2019ve broken down this movie into the emotions it will make you feel, and because we love a theme, we did it with emoji. \n[red X emoji] \nWarning: Emoji Movie spoilers, all the way up to the end of the film, lie ahead.\n[clown emoji] \nThe Emoji Movie opens with a voiceover from T.J. Miller proselytizing about the glory of the smartphone, which, as it turns out, is not a great way to start a movie. \u201cThe world we live in,\u201d he says, referring to a smartphone, \u201cit\u2019s so wonderful, mysterious, and magical.\u201d Of course, his magical world will soon be blown to metaphorical smithereens by a deranged Smiley Face Emoji and her army of bots. The Emoji Movie never decides whether technology will ruin our lives or save them, but it remains convinced it has to be one or the other. \n[grimace emoji]\nThe smartphone owner, named Alex, sits in a history class while his teacher rambles on about hieroglyphics. The teacher asks the class what hieroglyphics remind them of, winking so hard his eyeball almost pops out of the side of his head. They remain silent, pubescent, transfixed by their phones. The audience strains to keep the answer to themselves. The audience pleads with the class to answer the question, but they are so dumb, they have no idea what he could mean. \nMeanwhile, Alex asks his snotty friend what he should text to his crush Addie, in response to something she said earlier that day. What she texted was never revealed, but Alex decides to send a single emoji in response. \u201cWords aren\u2019t cool,\u201d his friend says, in a perfect bit of dialogue that effortlessly captures how teens really feel. Words aren\u2019t cool echoes into the back of the theater and reverberates off the skulls of adults, now terrified, unsure their mindless spawn can even speak a verbal language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Side-Eye Emoji]\nThe thumbs-up emoji has abs. \n[Shrugging Emoji]\nHi-5 takes Gene to the Loser Lounge, a place in Alex\u2019s messaging app where all the rarely used emoji, like the Fishcake, Grandma, and Broom all hang out and think about their pointless, idiotic emoji lives. Here, the writers had a chance to be thoughtful or maybe even sweet. What\u2019s it like to be an outcast emoji? Are you always waiting for some niche meme to bring you to the app\u2019s surface? Instead, they toss in a \u201cBye, Felicia\u201d joke, confirming they don\u2019t know who this movie is for, or what year it is. \nthe thumbs-up emoji has abs\n[Monkey Covering his Mouth Emoji]\nGene and Hi-5 go into the \u201cpiracy app,\u201d a grungy dive bar populated by internet trolls, spam, and the animated members of Twisted Sister. (You know, all that classic hacker stuff.) They finally meet a hacker named Jailbreak, and, in the greatest twist in cinematic history, the hacker turns out to be a woman. \n[Blowfish Emoji] \nHere, about midway through The Emoji Movie, the writers decide to ignore the plot in favor of a greater purpose: chastising teens about their social media use. As Gene and Hi-Five walk past the Facebook app, Hi-Five takes a moment to point out that this whole smartphone thing is actually super sad, and Alex is a total loser with no friends. \u201cNone of these people know him,\u201d says the Hi-Five emoji trapped in a phone, referring to his human boy master. \u201cThey like him.\u201d In case you missed it, the \u201clike\u201d here is referring to a Facebook Like \u2014 another classic bit of subtle Emoji Movie wit. \n[Volcano Emoji]\nAny pretense of storytelling gets thrown out the window as our emoji crew stops to play some quick nonessential games of Candy Crush and Dance Now, which basically act as elaborate commercials for apps desperately trying to hold onto their waning relevance. At one point, Gene tries to teach Jailbreak how to dance, telling her, \u201cFeel the music, express yourself.\u201d She responds by asking, \u201cThrough dance?\u201d proving herself to be a smooth and natural conversationalist. Later, in her usual coherent way, Jailbreak tells her boys, \u201cKeep it super DL.\u201d\n[Bag of Money emoji]\nSome lucky apps get prime placement in The Emoji Movie. Dropbox, for starters, is the portal to the perfect ethereal world of The Cloud, and is referenced by name at least 47 times. Spotify is a mystical wonderland full of sparkling rivers and romantic tunes, like Omi\u2019s 2015 hit \u201cCheerleader\u201d and Silent\u00f3\u2019s 2015 hit \u201cWatch Me (Whip / Nae Nae).\u201d \nAlex\u2019s phone also has Twitch, YouTube, WhatsApp, Shazam, and dozens of other apps. (Boys do always have way too many apps on their phones.) This part of The Emoji Movie is accurate, and hopefully profitable for everyone. It\u2019s so nice when people make money. Is there anything nicer?  \n[levitating slenderman emoji] \nGene finally explains his inner turmoil to Jailbreak. Here are some details about Gene: he wants friends. He has feelings. He cares about others. \u201cThis is my malfunction,\u201d he says. (Lizzie and Kaitlyn are crying weakly at this point, with no real faith left that there is any human being anywhere who has ever cared about a person.)\n\u201cWhat good is it to be number one if there aren\u2019t other numbers?\u201d he asks, and Jailbreak responds, in a shocked whisper, \u201cWow, that is actually kind of cool.\u201d This is a movie about how words aren\u2019t cool, but you can still expect a girl to fall at your feet in response to mild wordplay. Please keep up. Or throw whatever device you\u2019re reading this on into the ocean. Send me a postcard; tell me what it\u2019s like to be free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[woman with a macbook emoji]\nJailbreak\u2019s wig-hat combo is knocked off while she\u2019s dancing, revealing princess hair and a crown that is apparently part of her skull. Later, we find out her name is Linda. Linda is trying to escape from Alex\u2019s phone to someplace with less restrictive gender roles. \nOh, yeah, by the way, this is also a movie about feminism. As Linda says at one point, apropos of nothing, \u201cSLAY!\u201d\n[sunset emoji]\nGene\u2019s parents go looking for him, but they take a break to have a romantic moment inside a photo of Paris, inside Alex\u2019s Instagram account. They say, \u201cWe\u2019ll always have Paris,\u201d a reference to a movie from 1942. \n[skull emoji, ghost emoji, skull and crossbones emoji, rose-with-a-petal-falling-off emoji]\nGene and pals discover that Alex has a crush on a girl named Addie. They deduce this by reading an email he wrote to her but never sent. The text of the email is: \n\nYou\u2019re a shooting star I see\nA vision of ecstasy\nSo shine bright tonight, you and I\nWe're beautiful like diamonds in the sky\n\nAnd then a high-five emoji. \nHere is a list of people and corporations responsible for the existence of The Emoji Movie: production company Sony Pictures Animation, star T.J. Miller, distributor Columbia Pictures, writer Eric Siegel, writer Mike White, director Tony Leondis, original motion picture soundtrack contributor Ricky Reed, and all the Angry Birds (2016) guys, probably. We aren\u2019t going to give you their email addresses, but they probably aren\u2019t that hard to find.\n[bird emoji]\nThe deus ex machina in this film is a Twitter icon. Jailbreak and Hi-5, stranded in The Cloud after Gene is kidnapped by some virus bots, use Jailbreak\u2019s secret princess powers to summon an animated blue bird. It flies them back into the phone on its back. I don\u2019t fucking know.  \n[no-mouth emoji]\nAlex is going to delete everything off his phone because it played music out loud a few times and sent a weird emoji once. So to save all of the emoji and the entire \u201cworld\u201d of Alex\u2019s phone, Gene cooks up an animated multi-face emoji that\u2019s part blush, part kiss-face, part smile, and all romance, baby. Jailbreak sends this one emoji and no words to Alex\u2019s crush, who then compliments him on being \u201cone of those guys who can actually express his feelings.\u201d \nthe deus ex machina is an animated Twitter icon\nAs these words come out of Addie\u2019s mouth, Lizzie\u2019s head falls off her neck and rolls under the seat in front of her, and then steadily makes its way to the front of the theater, picking up flecks of popcorn and stray Skittles as it goes. \n[tongue-out emoji]\nAfter Alex\u2019s phone successfully seduces the teenage girl of his dreams for him, he decides not to delete everything off of it and announces, affectionately, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s weird, but I\u2019m gonna hold onto it.\u201d His faith is restored. This is a modern bildungsroman. In auditorium 9, in the AMC on 42nd street, in New York, New York, several people cheer.\nKaitlyn has to go pick up Lizzie\u2019s head, but it\u2019s sort of hard because she\u2019s aged 70 years in the time she\u2019s been watching The Emoji Movie, and all her muscles have atrophied. \n[woman getting a head massage emoji]\nWhen The Emoji Movie finally ends, Lizzie and Kaitlyn somehow manage to exit the movie theater through a Dave & Busters and emerge into mid-morning Times Square to see that the sidewalk is completely obstructed by at least 300 people trying to get into Madame Tussauds wax museum. At this point, Lizzie stops in her tracks and screams, \u201cI hate it here,\u201d in the tone of voice that usually precedes a full-body sob. Passing a group of singing children being ushered through the 42nd Street subway station in a single-file line that blocks just about every turnstile and staircase, Kaitlyn shouts, \u201cWhy would you encourage these children to yell?\u201d at whoever is in charge. Then Lizzie and Kaitlyn wait for a delayed 2 train with their hands over their mouths. \nSitting down to write this review, Lizzie says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can say anything funny about this, because it makes me want to die.\u201d At least she can actually express her emotions, even if she does have to use words to do it.\n"}
