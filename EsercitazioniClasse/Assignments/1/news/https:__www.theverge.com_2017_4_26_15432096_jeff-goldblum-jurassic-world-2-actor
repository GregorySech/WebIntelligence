{"title": "Jeff Goldblum can't say no to dinosaurs, will appear in Jurassic World sequel", "content": " \nIt's time to dust off your leather jacket, open the top buttons on your shirt, and practice your weird laugh \u2014 Jeff Goldblum is coming back to Jurassic Park. The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that the actor will be appearing alongside stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in the sequel to 2015's Jurassic World, due in theaters on June 22nd next year. \nGoldblum played Dr. Ian Malcolm in the 1993 smash hit, the impossibly suave mathematician and chaos theorist brought in to poke holes in John Hammond's cockamamy dino-breeding scheme. Malcolm made it out of the original park, only to head right back for the sequel, Jurassic Park: The Lost World. Since then, though, he's apparently taken his \"life finds a way\" mantra to heart, skipping out on sequels Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World. \nUntil now, anyway. It's not clear exactly what Goldblum will be doing in the new movie, but if the internet has its way, he'll spend at least some of the movie lying seductively on the table with his shirt undone, waiting for Sam Neill to press his face against his chest. \n"}
