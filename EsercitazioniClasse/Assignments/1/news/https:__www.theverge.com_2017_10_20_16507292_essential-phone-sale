{"title": "Essential Phone is $100 off at Best Buy", "content": " \nRemember the Essential Phone; the all-screen smartphone with 128GB of storage and magnetic accessories that Andy Rubin announced in May? That was a long time ago in phone years, and well before a spate of other bezel-less devices including the iPhone X, Galaxy Note 8, LG V30, Mi Mix 2, and others made their debuts (not to mention the Google Pixels). Well, the unlocked Essential PH-1 is now on sale at Best Buy for $599.99; $100 less than the price asked by both Sprint and essential.com. \nIt might not be essential, but at this price the Essential Phone might be nice to have.\n\n\n\n\n"}
