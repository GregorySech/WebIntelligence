{"title": "Apple releases iOS 11.1.1 to fix annoying I autocorrect bug", "content": " iOS 11.1.1 is here, and it comes with a small but important update: a fix for the strange autocorrect bug in iOS 11.1 that has been automatically changing the letter \u201cI\u201d to \u201cA [?]\u201d for some users. Apple had previously recommended using Text Replacement as a manual workaround so that users could type the letter \u201cI\u201d again, but it seems things are finally back to normal again with the new update.Along with the autocorrect fix, the update also fixes an issue where \u201cHey Siri\u201d voice recognition stopped working. iOS 11.1.1 is available to download now.
