{"content": " YouTube says it\u2019s updated its automated flagging system to restrict advertisements on fewer videos. The new algorithm, which began rolling out yesterday afternoon, is supposed to more accurately reflect YouTube\u2019s guidelines for ad-friendly material. It will supposedly reduce the number of demonetized listings by 30 percent, so \u201cmillions more videos\u201d will be able to make money off the full range of advertisements. The change could help salve users\u2019 frustrations over YouTube\u2019s ad policy, a long-standing point of tension that\u2019s become more pressing over the past year.A YouTube manager writes that the new algorithm was trained by nearly three months\u2019 worth of human reviews, starting after YouTube added a manual appeals process for creators in August. Theoretically, this should narrow the range of false positives \u2014 videos that were incorrectly flagged for promoting drug use, using excessive profanity, highlighting gratuitous violence, or otherwise featuring content that advertisers might find objectionable. It\u2019s being applied retroactively, so creators who didn\u2019t appeal could still get some old videos remonetized. Google also encourages people to keep appealing potentially incorrect flags, because \u201cthis updated system is an improvement, but it\u2019s not perfect.\u201dAs Polygon notes, YouTube creators started warning of an \u201cadpocalypse\u201d this spring, after seeing lots of videos stripped of advertising for unclear reasons. YouTube has spent the ensuing months trying to make the standards more consistent and transparent. But it\u2019s still shaken YouTube video makers\u2019 faith in advertising as a main source of funding.If creators have fundamental problems with the advertiser guidelines, this doesn\u2019t actually change the rules \u2014 which can limit videos that cover any \u201csensitive\u201d topics, for instance, even if they\u2019re non-graphic and presented for news or educational purposes. The change will also be moot for small or new channels, since YouTube requires at least 10,000 overall views before offering ad revenue. But if the new algorithm does massively reduce the number of demonetized videos, creators will at least be able to better predict which videos advertisers won\u2019t touch.", "title": "YouTube is fighting the \u2018adpocalypse\u2019 with a less trigger-happy flagging system"}
