{"title": "Living with the Chevy Bolt in the real world", "content": " \nWhen the Chevrolet Bolt was introduced last year, it captured a sweet spot in the marketplace. With the launch of the Bolt, GM became the first carmaker to sell a fully electric car with a range of over 200 miles and a sticker price under $40,000. It won industry accolades and awards and put GM back on the map in the electric car race. GM did exactly what Tesla is still promising with its forthcoming Model 3, but unlike that car, the Bolt is available right now. \nDriving a fully electric car in the present has its own set of challenges, however, even one with an extended range compared to other models like the BMW i3 or the Nissan Leaf. We spent a week driving the Bolt in upstate New York to get an idea of what it\u2019s like to live with a fully electric car on a daily basis \u2014 and whether we\u2019re ready to give up our gasoline-powered people movers just yet.\n"}
