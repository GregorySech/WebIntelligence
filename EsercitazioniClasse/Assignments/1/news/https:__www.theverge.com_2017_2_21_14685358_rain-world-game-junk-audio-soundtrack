{"title": "How the composers of Rain World created an alien soundscape using old cans and pipes", "content": " \nFive years ago, James Therrien was browsing an indie gaming forum when he stumbled across an in-development title that he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about. Called Rain World, the game starred a cute little creature called a slugcat, who is forced to survive a harsh, industrial alien landscape teeming with vicious predators. \u201cI loved the visuals so much, that as soon as I saw it I had this complete audio picture in my head of what it should sound like,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was so bad that I had a nightmare that the game came out and was filled with garbage music.\u201d\nNot long after that nightmare, Therrien went ahead and crafted a dozen songs and sent them directly to designer Joar Jakobsson. It was his pitch to do the soundtrack \u2014 and it worked. Therrien joined the team as Rain World\u2019s composer, alongside fellow musician Lydia Esrig, and set to work writing music in the chiptunes style the two were known for. (Esrig and Therrien also perform as a duo called Bright Primate.) But as development progressed, the sound wasn\u2019t working out quite right. The bright chiptune bleeps and bloops didn\u2019t exactly fit the bleak alien landscape of the game. What it needed was some junk.\n\u201cI\u2019d go out late at night with a recorder.\u201d\nTo create Rain World\u2019s distinct soundscape, the composers used a technique known as \u201cjunk audio.\u201d Essentially the idea is to use everyday objects \u2014 rusted tin cans, old car parts \u2014 record the sounds they make, and then mash them together into a song. \u201cYou take it, and you process it, and you amplify it, and it becomes something else,\u201d Therrien says of the process. He started out by using field recordings of various objects he found online, compulsively gathering a huge library of sounds. And when the sound wasn\u2019t quite right he went out and recorded his own. \u201cI was using a lot of steel rebar sounds being smacked against each other, but I couldn\u2019t get the right ones,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo I\u2019d go out late at night with a recorder and be in the park banging stuff together making these sounds, while trying not to get arrested or raise the ire of my neighbors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Therrien had the sound he wanted, he\u2019d essentially turn it into an instrument, tweaking it so it could serve as a track\u2019s percussion or bass. He says that the songs in the game were composed primarily using these junk audio instruments. Rain World features three and a half hours of music spanning 160 tracks, and it required thousands of junk sounds to produce it all.\nFor the most part, the sounds came from mundane objects: brake drums, a car radiator, old paint cans. Sometimes he would record people speaking, and then twist it so that it had a strange alien effect, while still retaining some humanity. \u201cIt was to give it it\u2019s own unique language,\u201d Therrien says of the reasoning behind using junk audio. \u201cAs if a musical tradition had come out of this world. What sort of musical aesthetic would be created from this environment if given time?\u201d\n(In the example below, the thumping bass you hear was originally a five-second-long recording of Therrien saying \u201cI\u2019m literally just recording audio right now.\u201d)\n\nOne of the reasons the game has so much music is that it\u2019s not only physically large \u2014 spanning a dozen regions and around 1,600 individual areas \u2014 but also features dynamic, unscripted events. Much like in No Man\u2019s Sky, the soundtrack of Rain World is designed to respond to what\u2019s actually happening, changing depending on what you\u2019re doing. Therrien describes the system as \u201cthreat music.\u201d The idea is that as the slugcat is pursued by dangerous creatures, the music will respond accordingly. If a small enemy appears, you might hear some light drums fade in. As things get more dangerous, the intensity ramps up.\n\u201cThings can get wacky and sound nasty.\u201d\nIn order to make this work, each track had to be written so that it could be chopped up, with each part standing on its own. Every song in the game is made up of between 8\u201312 layers, which will fade in or out depending on the context. The idea is to not only make it so the music responds to the action, but also ensure you\u2019re not hearing the same songs repeatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re never really seeing a complete piece of the musical picture,\u201d Therrien explains.\nOne of the reasons junk audio isn\u2019t especially common is because it can be hard to control. Unlike a typical musical instrument, you don\u2019t always know what to expect when you bang a wrench on some old plumbing. (In fact, some of the tracks proved too intense \u2014 one had to be toned down after its extreme sounds broke a pair of Beats headphones.) But for Therrien, that\u2019s the point. Rain World takes place in a harsh alien world, and it should have the sounds to match. \u201cThings can get wacky and sound nasty,\u201d he says of the process. \u201cBut that\u2019s kind of what I was going for.\u201d\nRain World is scheduled to launch later this year on PC and PS4.\n"}
