{"title": "How about an Android Pro?", "content": " \nAt Google I/O this past week, I got my first taste of the next version of Android and I enjoyed almost everything about it. Android has gotten to the stage where improvements come in only incremental steps, and Google is mostly making the right ones with its annual updates. But I have an underlying worry about where this is all going: as Android grows more proactive and assistive, I fear it might end up alienating its more technically inclined users.\nSo here\u2019s a radical thought: maybe there\u2019s now room for more than one canonical variant of Android. I can already hear the chorus of disagreement, chanting the word \"fragmentation\" with cautionary zeal, but Google is already working on a modified version with Android Go, its extra lean serving for lower-spec devices. What I have in mind is a similarly stripped-down option intended for pro users: an Android Pro.\nGoogle\u2019s vision of the future of Android \u2014 and the future of mobile and personal technology more broadly \u2014 is defined by automation. Google Assistant is the user-facing aspect of an artificial intelligence juggernaut that promises to transform how we use our devices and, in many ways, make us more dependent on them.\nOreos for the pros\nAs Android has evolved, it has consistently moved closer to Apple\u2019s deliberately simplified approach to mobile software. The latest Android O streamlines the settings menu by presenting only the most-used options and tucking the rest away into expandable \"advanced\" menus. With every version of the core OS and app updates, I see more hand holding and bigger training wheels from Google.\nAs enthusiastic a Google Photos user as I am, I don\u2019t like being nagged to back up my photos every time I open the app, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll much enjoy receiving constant reminders about Google photo books when they become available. There used to be a time when Google Maps was just a mapping application, but now it takes a couple of extra seconds to load while Google furnishes it with extra search options and local business information (mostly the locations of the nearest pizzerias). Maps has also developed an unfortunate habit of pumping notifications my way, whether it\u2019s for road traffic that isn\u2019t relevant to me or urging me to contribute my photos of known landmarks.\nIt is while setting up a new Android phone, as I uncheck every superfluous notification option on Maps, Android Pay, Docs, Drive, Photos, and YouTube that I come to think, this is Windows behavior. My standard operating procedure with any new Windows PC setup is to deselect all the options that Microsoft ticks for me \u2014 and now Android is bulking out to match that (admittedly minor) annoyance.\nSpeaking with Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer during Google I/O, I was told that the teams responsible for all of these apps make their decisions based on a lot of user research and (anonymized, he was quick to point out) data. One of Android\u2019s outstanding challenges is informing people of everything the system can do, and the prompts for action from Google\u2019s apps are helpful pointers for neophytes. In essence, Google\u2019s lowest common denominator is gradually shifting lower, as the company looks to scoop up every last feature phone holdout while at the same time matching the accessibility of Apple\u2019s iOS.\nIf cars can have a sport mode that disables assists, why not phones too?\nThere\u2019s always a balance to be struck when trying to keep experienced users moving at their fastest without leaving new ones behind. The trouble for me is that Google\u2019s assistive efforts aren\u2019t all optional. The suggested email replies of Google Inbox, for example, were promoted to the main Gmail app in Android during I/O \u2014 and, much like my colleague Adi Robertson, I find them off-putting in the way they impersonate me. Aside from the inappropriateness of offering canned responses when someone might be reading an intensely personal message, these responses just take up screen space.\nIf cars can have a sport mode that stiffens the suspension, heightens throttle response, and disables driving assists for a purer and faster experience, why not phones, too? I want something like Android Go \u2014 barebones, simplified, streamlined to run as fast as possible \u2014 but with all the latest and greatest capabilities that Android can support. All the torque, none of the training wheels.\nMy idea for an Android Pro wouldn\u2019t meaningfully contribute to Android\u2019s long-unresolved issue of software fragmentation because the thing I envision is taking features away, not adding more. I can live without Google Assistant and without Uber and Lyft being directly integrated into Maps. Just give me the familiar single-purpose, siloed-off apps, and let me worry about connecting the dots between them. That\u2019s the way Android grew to its present popularity, and there are many of us already accustomed to highly effective workflows built atop its simple, un-enhanced structure.\nAn Android Pro could also serve as a useful branding tool, giving Android OEMs an excuse not to mess around with creating their own skins and user assists, shipping Google\u2019s prepared code as it is, which could in turn accelerate updates and reinforce the idea of this being an OS for professionals.\nApple might not have more than one version of iOS, but then Apple isn\u2019t trying to address the full range of smartphone users. Google, on the contrary, wants to put an Android device in everyone\u2019s hands, and that\u2019s what has pushed it to create Android Go for the affordable segment of the market. Now how about an Android Pro for the enthusiast and professional groups that gave Android its first taste of success?\n"}
