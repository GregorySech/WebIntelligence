{"title": "Samsung's new Galaxy Tab A takes on Amazon's low-cost tablets", "content": " \nSamsung's newest Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab A, appears to be targeted directly at families. That means it competes against Amazon's line of kid-friendly tablets, although Samsung's version is way more expensive. The Tab A features an eight-inch, 1280 x 800 display, a 5,000mAh battery, 32GB of built-in storage, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera. Here are the rest of the specs:\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor\nAndroid 7.1.1 Nougat\n2GB of RAM\nUp to 256GB of expandable storage\nUSB-C\nAvailable in black or silver\n\nMore than anything, Samsung markets the device's family features. Like Amazon's Fire tablets, kids can have their own accounts with parental controls set up ahead of time, like time limits and available content. A specific \"kids mode\" populates the tablet with apps and games from Samsung partners, including Lego, although only some are included for free. Calls and notifications can also be turned off while kids play games, too.\nAmazon's Fire tablets include similar features, along with more insight into how kids use the tablets through an online dashboard. Samsung is clearly attempting to capture the same market as Amazon, but its Tab A costs more than double the price of a typical Fire tablet. It'll be $229.99 when it's released on November 1st, as opposed to $80 for Amazon's Fire HD 8 or the seven-inch 7 Kids Edition Tablet.\nSamsung's likely banking on its name and reputation to sell these devices, as well as the fact that its tablet runs true Android, as opposed to Amazon's Fire OS.\n"}
