{"title": "Watch the making of Star Wars: Battlefront II\u2019s single-player campaign", "content": " \nThe hype for Star Wars: Battlefront II has been slowly building, and today EA released a new behind-the-scenes clip detailing the making of the game\u2019s eagerly-anticipated single-player campaign. The video was first shown during the \u201cLevel Up\u201d gaming panel at Disney\u2019s D23 Expo, which also featured Janina Gavankar - the actor that plays the lead role in Battlefront II.\nMost Star Wars stories have focused on the \u201cgood guys\u201d: the Rebel Alliance, or the Resistance in the newer films. Battlefront II will flip that on its head by putting players in the shoes of Iden Versio, an Imperial Special Forces officer who sees the destruction of the second Death Star while on the forest moon of Endor. From there, she sets out to seek revenge against the Rebels, in a storyline that starts during the final moments of Return of the Jedi and stretches all the way up to current movies like The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Star Wars: Battlefront II is scheduled for release on November 17th.\n"}
