{"title": "Here's a Tesla inside Elon Musk's LA tunnel", "content": " \nWell look at that, a car in a tunnel. Not just any car, but a Tesla Model S inside a tunnel being dug beneath Los Angeles by Elon Musk's Boring Company. Proof once and for all that a car can, uh, fit inside of a tunnel.\nOh, right, you're not supposed to drive through the tunnel yourself. The plan is for regular cars to be lowered down on a lift to an awaiting \"electric skate\" that will transport vehicles along magnetic rails at speeds of up to 124 mph (200 km/h).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla for scale\n\n\nThe test tunnel being built beneath SpaceX\u2019s headquarters in Hawthorne, just outside of Los Angeles, is a proof of concept. A dry run, if you will, that will let Musk and Co say, \"See, I've safely built a two-mile-long underground test tunnel, now give me the approvals I need to build my first Hyperloop.\" \nSo yes, it's a car in a tunnel \u2014 but it's also the proverbial canary in a coal mine that should be a warning to those who profit off entrenched forms of transportation.\n"}
