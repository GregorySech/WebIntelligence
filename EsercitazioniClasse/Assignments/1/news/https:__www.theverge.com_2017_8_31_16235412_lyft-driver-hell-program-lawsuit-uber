{"title": "Judge dismisses lawsuit over Uber\u2019s \u2018Hell\u2019 program", "content": " \nA US District Court judge in California dismissed a class action lawsuit against Uber by a former Lyft driver over the company\u2019s \u201cHell\u201d program, which it allegedly used between 2014 and 2016 to track drivers of the rival service. \nThe \u201cHell\u201d program was first revealed by The Information back in April. With it, Uber allegedly created fake Lyft rider accounts that then let them track how many drivers were available on the service in different areas. Uber was then able to use this information to deploy its own drivers to areas underserved by Lyft on a real-time basis.\nUber also allegedly used \u201cHell\u201d to find Lyft drivers who split their time driving for Uber, and used that information to offer those drivers incentives to drop Lyft altogether. \nThe lawsuit, filed in April by Michael Gonzales, accused Uber of violating the Electronic Communication Privacy Act, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California\u2019s Unfair Competition law. The plaintiff alleged that Uber was using \u201cintercepted\u201d communications to drive the \u201cHell\u201d program. \nUber claimed that the case was poorly argued, and the judge seems to have agreed\nBut Uber filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this summer, arguing the plaintiff didn\u2019t make a proper case that Uber \u201cintercepted\u201d that information, which it also claimed was \u201creadily accessible to the general public.\u201d Uber also argued that it didn\u2019t violate CIPA because Lyft drivers consent to giving up their location data when they use the app. \nThe company\u2019s legal team also insisted that Gonzales didn\u2019t properly allege loss of money or property to justify the Unfair Competition law. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted Uber\u2019s motion today with \u201cleave to amend,\u201d so Gonzales will be able to amend his complaint and file another lawsuit. Uber declined to comment. \n\u201cHell\u201d was reportedly discontinued at the end of 2016, and it was one of a few notably aggressive internal tools used by Uber in its push to dominate the ride-hailing market. It was similar to the infamous \u201cGod View\u201d mode that the company used to track its own drivers (and a journalist). Both of those programs came on now-former CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s watch, whose willingness to put growth before everything else eventually led to his resignation earlier this summer. Of course, Uber still has plenty of other problems for its new CEO, former Expedia chief Dara Khosrowshahi, to deal with when he starts next week.  \n"}
