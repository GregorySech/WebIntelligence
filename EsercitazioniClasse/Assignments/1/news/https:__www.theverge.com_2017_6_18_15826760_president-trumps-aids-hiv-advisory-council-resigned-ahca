{"title": "Six members of President Trump\u2019s advisory council on HIV/AIDS have resigned", "content": " \nThe Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) is a body responsible for providing recommendations and information to the president, as well as overseeing the nation\u2019s strategy for combatting the illness. On Friday, six members of the council resigned, writing in an op-ed published in Newsweek that they can no longer be effective under a \u201cpresident who simply does not care.\u201d\nThe letter was written by Scott Schoettes, who was joined by five other members: Lucy Bradley-Springer, Gina Brown, Ulysses Burley III, Michelle Ogle, and Grissel Granados. In the letter, he explains President Donald Trump\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t taken steps to formulate a strategy for combatting the illness, \u201cand\u2014most concerning\u2014pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease.\u201d\nPACHA was formed under then-President Clinton in 1995 to provide recommendations for the ongoing AIDS epidemic, which followed President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1987 President\u2019s Commission on the HIV Epidemic and 1988\u2019s National Commission on AIDS. Under the President Barack Obama, the council helped the administration craft a new national strategy, designed to reduce infections, increase access to care, reduce health inequalities, and coordinate a national response. \nSchoettes noted that while the commission met with Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders during the primaries, it didn\u2019t have the opportunity to meet with then-candidate Trump. He also indicated that the website for the Office of National AIDS policy was one of many taken down when Trump took office. (It has yet to be replaced.) The president also has yet to name a head to the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, which was formed in 2010 as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s While House Domestic Policy Council. \nUnder the ACA, more people learned about their HIV status and received care\nThe letter particularly singled out the administration\u2019s efforts to scale back the Affordable Care Act, saying that the law has resulted in \u201cgains in the percentage of people with HIV who know their status, the percentage engaged in care, [and] the percentage receiving successful treatment.\u201d The proposals to replace the ACA with the American Health Care Act \u201cwould be particularly devastating for people living with HIV.\u201d The six explain that they feel that they would \u201cbe more effective from the outside,\u201d urging members of Congress to continue to listen to advocates as they work to reform the health care system.\n \n\n"}
