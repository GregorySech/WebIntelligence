{"title": "Trump signs executive order to expand offshore oil and gas drilling in Arctic and beyond", "content": " \nPresident Donald Trump just signed an executive order aimed at expanding offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans \u2014 and maybe even in the Pacific Ocean. The move, which is expected to lead to litigation in the courts, is the latest attempt to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. Last month, Trump began the process to halt Obama\u2019s cornerstone plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions. And on Wednesday, he signed another executive order that could expand oil and gas development on wilderness areas currently protected as national monuments.\nToday\u2019s executive order instructs the Department of the Interior to review locations for offshore oil and gas exploration and leasing that were put off limits by the Obama administration. That includes millions of acres in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans that Obama withdrew permanently from drilling in December 2016. The order also asks for a review of marine monuments and sanctuaries created in the past 10 years, and prohibits the creation of new ones, according to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who spoke to reporters about the order last night.\nThe order is expected to lead to litigation in the courts\n\u201cThis executive order starts the process of opening offshore areas to job-creating energy exploration,\u201d Trump said today before signing the order. \u201cIt reverses the previous administration\u2019s Arctic leasing ban ... and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our treasury and jobs to our workers.\u201d\nThe Interior Department oversees some 1.7 billion acres on the outer continental shelf, the submerged lands off the coasts of the US. The department is responsible for coming up with five-year plans to indicate which offshore locations can be leased for oil and gas development. The latest plan for the years 2017\u20132022 was finalized under the Obama administration; in a major blow to the oil industry, the plan put certain areas in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans off limits for drilling, instead allowing leasing in the Gulf of Mexico and in Alaska's Cook Inlet. \nTrump is now asking the Interior Department for a review of this five-year plan. As the president, he has every right to. \u201cThat is well within the boundary of the Interior Department\u2019s authority,\u201d says Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing that Obama administration did on offshore drilling when they came into power in 2009.\u201d\nRevising the plan, however, will take time, Book tells The Verge. But eventually, the new plan could include offshore areas that were previously put off limits \u2014 including waters off the Pacific Coast. Under Obama, those waters were not included in the five-year plan, as the governors of Washington, Oregon, and California voiced opposition to drilling off their shores. But Zinke said that nothing is off the table, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at everything,\u201d Zinke said when asked about potential oil leases in the Pacific Ocean. \u201cA new administration should look at the policies and make sure the policies are appropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s going to be \u201cincredibly unpopular,\u201d says Nancy Pyne, a campaign director at Oceana, an ocean conservation organization that opposes drilling. Pyne says that the president has to consult with the governors of Western states before allowing drilling in Pacific waters. But, eventually, the administration doesn\u2019t have to take their opinions into consideration when making a final decision. \u201cGiven this president\u2019s track record of bucking the trend, we\u2019re very worried that he\u2019s going to move forward with drilling off the Pacific Coast as well,\u201d she tells The Verge.\nIf the Interior Department decides to allow drilling in certain off-limit areas in the Atlantic and the Arctic, that could eventually lead to legal challenges. That\u2019s because Obama indefinitely banned some of the areas from drilling under a 1953 law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. In December alone, Obama used the law to safeguard 3.8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 from southern Virginia to off of Cape Cod \u2014 and 115 million acres in the Arctic Ocean \u2014 including all of the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska, and most of the Beaufort Sea off Alaska\u2019s northern edge. \nIt\u2019s unclear whether a new president has the authority to reverse those bans without Congress, says Robin Craig, an environmental law professor at the University of Utah. If, following this executive order, the Trump administration decides to go ahead and open up those areas, environmental groups will likely sue. But because there\u2019s no precedent, it\u2019s unclear what the outcome of those lawsuits will be. \u201cWho knows whether they\u2019ll win or lose,\u201d Book says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been litigated yet.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve fought this before and we\u2019ll fight it again.\u201d\nBut groups like Oceana are ready to fight. Drilling in Arctic waters is dangerous and there\u2019s no proven way to clean sea ice from potential oil spills, Pyne says. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s stormy, and it\u2019s covered in sea ice,\u201d she says. And drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts is unpopular with businesses and residents in coastal states. Oil spill can negatively affect fishing and tourism, and states just don\u2019t want to risk it. \u201cRegardless who\u2019s in the White House coastal communities and businesses do not want offshore drilling off their coast,\u201d Pyne says. \nSo today\u2019s executive order is probably the beginning of a long fight in the courts. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought this before and we\u2019ll fight it again,\u201d Pyne says.\n"}
