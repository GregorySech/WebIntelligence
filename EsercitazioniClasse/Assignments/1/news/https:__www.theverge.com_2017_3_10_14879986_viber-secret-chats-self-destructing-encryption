{"title": "Messaging app Viber is adding self-destructing chats for its 800 million users", "content": " \nYou might not have heard of Viber, but it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest messaging apps \u2014 more than 800 million registered users worldwide, with strong followings in parts of Asia, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa. Now, in order to give its customers a little more privacy and security, the company is introducing a new feature named \u201csecret chats.\u201d This basically gives users the option of starting conversations that self-destruct after a certain time limit. \nIt follows on from the app\u2019s introduction of \u201csecret messages\u201d earlier this year \u2014 which allowed users to put the same self-destructing timer on individual messages. Secret Chats also block messages from being forwarded to other conversations, notify users on iOS when someone takes a screenshot, and blocks screenshots altogether on Android. Like Viber\u2019s regular conversations, messages are encrypted end-to-end, and you can also hide secret chats behind a PIN code if you wish. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret chats vs. regular chats on Viber.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just another example of how privacy and security features that were previously niche have become commonplace in the messaging world. Everyone needs to encrypt, because everyone is spying. Viber\u2019s secret chats function should be rolling out to users on Android and iOS early next week. \n"}
