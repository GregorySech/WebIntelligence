{"title": "Star Trek: Discovery\u2019s incredible Comic-Con trailer shows a cold war with the Klingons", "content": " \nThe Comic-Con trailer for Star Trek: Discovery just landed, and it\u2019s the best look yet at the new series. Here, the Federation is on the verge of a cold war with a resurgent Klingon Empire, and Starfleet Commander Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green), the first officer aboard the USS Shenzhou, finds herself caught in the middle of the growing conflict.\nStar Trek: Discovery has long been a troubled production, having to deal with delays and loss of showrunner Bryan Fuller. However, it\u2019s really starting to look like it\u2019s come together in time for its fall debut on CBS. The Klingons look particularly menacing in this outing as the core antagonists. Thought they don\u2019t exactly look like the iconic race from the Next Generation era, Chris Obi (American Gods), who plays Klingon captain T\u2019Kuvma, looks every bit as intimidating as any version of the characters from the past.\nStar Trek: Discovery debuts on CBS on September 24th.\n"}
