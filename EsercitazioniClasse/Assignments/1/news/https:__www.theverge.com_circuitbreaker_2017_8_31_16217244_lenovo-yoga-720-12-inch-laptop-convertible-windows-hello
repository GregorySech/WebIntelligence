{"title": "The Lenovo Yoga 720 laptop is coming in a smaller, 12-inch size", "content": " \nLenovo\u2019s mid-range 700-series Yoga laptops have been getting good enough lately that you might think twice before stepping up to the top-tier 900-series devices. Now, after releasing 13 and 15-inch Yoga 720s earlier this year, the company is releasing a more portable 12-inch variant.\nThe new model is called, predictably enough, the Lenovo Yoga 720 12-inch. You can spec it out with an i3, i5, or i7 processor \u2014 all from Intel\u2019s 7th generation Core family. The 12-inch model isn\u2019t quite as svelte as some of the competition \u2014 it\u2019s thicker than a MacBook for sure, and weighs half a pound more. But then again, you get a faster processor and a cheaper price, as it starts at $649 for the base model.\nThat thickness also yields you both a USB-A and a USB-C port. It charges with a custom Lenovo power jack, which is a little annoying, but you can use USB-C to charge it if you want. I\u2019d prefer Lenovo to have just put in another USB-C port. It supports Windows Hello via a built-in fingerprint sensor and ships with a 12.-5-inch FHD IPS touchscreen, which itself supports Windows Ink if you have the right stylus. You can turn the screen all the way around into a tablet mode, though you\u2019re not getting the fancy watch-style hinge Lenovo puts on its high-end machines. Lenovo says battery life should last \u201cup to 8 hours.\u201d\nSpeccing up the processor and RAM will be tempting and will definitely push the price well above that $649 starting point. I don\u2019t know if the 12-inch Yoga 720 would count as an \u201cultrabook\u201d (remember when we called them ultrabooks?), but I do know that it\u2019s nice to see smaller-sized laptops that hit this mid-range zone with decent specs and build quality. \nLenovo says they\u2019ll be available in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
