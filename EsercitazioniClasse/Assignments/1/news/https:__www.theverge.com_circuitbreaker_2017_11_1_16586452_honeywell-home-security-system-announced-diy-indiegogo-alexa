{"title": "Honeywell announces a DIY security system with Alexa integration", "content": " \nHoneywell has made security systems for decades now, but this year, it\u2019s starting to branch out into the upstart DIY home security market. It\u2019s introducing a line called the Honeywell Smart Home Security System, which revolves around a base station that sort of looks like an Amazon Echo with a giant camera on the top. The camera syncs with a bunch of different sensors to monitor your home and send you notifications about whatever it sees happening.\nWhile the pitch here is security \u2014 it\u2019s in the name, after all \u2014 Honeywell says it\u2019s really focused on building out features around keeping you informed of \u201cwhat's going on at home.\u201d That means knowing who\u2019s coming and going, whether you left a window open, and so on.\nFor now, those features are on pretty even footing with the basic security features, which I suspect are what most people will initially buy this (and similar) systems for. But in the long term, I think Honeywell is looking in the right direction here. Burglaries are relatively rare, so if Honeywell can provide features that are tangibly useful on a daily basis, people will get more out of this system and have a bigger reason to invest.\nHoneywell is launching on Indiegogo\nHoneywell\u2019s DIY security system is pretty basic to start. There are only two sensors \u2014 infrared motion detectors ($50) and window/door opening detectors ($40) \u2014 as well as a key fob ($30) for setting and disarming the alarm. Then there\u2019s the main hub ($400): it has a camera on the top, which can be used to detect motion and identify people; it has lights on the bottom, to cue you into what\u2019s going on; and then it has a speaker, which is apparently capable of emitting a 90 dB alarm. The speaker hooks into Alexa, so you can ask it questions and use it to command other smart home products, too.\nThe security features are also pretty simple. Using the camera, Honeywell\u2019s system offers motion and sound detection, and it can mask out areas \u2014 say, a window facing a busy street \u2014 that you don\u2019t want to monitor. Eventually, the company plans to add facial recognition so that the system can send out push notifications when someone arrives home. That kind of feature typically costs money, and it\u2019s not clear yet if Honeywell will eventually charge for it.\nYou can only have one hub as part of the entire system, which seems like a weird limitation to me. You can add on more cameras though, by hooking up Honeywell\u2019s existing C1 and C2 security cameras. Both are indoor cameras, and Honeywell says that it\u2019s working on an outdoor one to complement them. It\u2019s also planning a hybrid motion sensor / video camera that only turns on after motion is detected ($99 for an indoor model, $199 for an outdoor model).\nAnd while many companies offering similar products are happy to sell customers a professional monitoring service on top \u2014 so that if the alarm goes off, someone will give them a call to make sure everything\u2019s okay \u2014 Honeywell isn\u2019t going to do that, at least not at first. At launch, it\u2019s totally DIY. You\u2019ll get a notification if your alarm goes off, and that\u2019s it. That might be good enough for some uses, but I suspect it\u2019ll be a nonstarter for many.\nThe whole system sounds really similar to the stuff that Netgear, Ring, Nest, and many more are all starting to build out right now. Honeywell may have a much longer history than those companies, but those companies largely have a head start when it comes to device and service offerings. It\u2019ll be important for Honeywell to expand its portfolio so that it offers the same kind of flexibility.\nIn an odd twist, Honeywell is going to be launching this system through Indiegogo. It says the purpose of that is to get feedback from the community so that it can improve the product (though crowdfunding is also just a good way to juice sales). When it actually goes on sale sometime next year, a starter kit \u2014 with the camera base station, two window/door sensors, and a key fob \u2014 will sell for $499.99. That\u2019s a really high starting price, and it seems like it\u2019ll initially be a tough sell over the many systems that are already available.\nUpdate November 2nd, 11:30AM ET: Honeywell has raised the expected prices for its indoor and outdoor motion detector cameras from $80 and $170 to $99 and $199. This article has been updated to reflect the new pricing.\n"}
