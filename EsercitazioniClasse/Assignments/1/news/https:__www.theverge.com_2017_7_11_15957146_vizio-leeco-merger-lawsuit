{"title": "Vizio sues LeEco over failed merger", "content": " \nVizio has filed two lawsuits against troubled Chinese electronics company LeEco over an attempted merger between the two companies that unraveled and eventually collapsed earlier this year. The US TV maker alleges that even at the time of the deal\u2019s announcement, LeEco had already \u201cbegun to collapse due to their severe cash flow and financial problems.\u201d LeEco\u2019s money woes have been a running story for months, and Vizio\u2019s sharply worded complaint says that the whole acquisition was a front for LeEco to create a positive impression of its financial standing. That directly contradicts what both companies said in April, when they jointly cited \u201cregulatory headwinds\u201d as the primary factor in the merger\u2019s failure. \nVizio\u2019s primary federal complaint seeks $60 million in damages in addition to punitive damages. The lawsuit says that during negotiations both in Beijing and Irvine, California (where Vizio is based), LeEco executives fraudulently claimed the company was financially healthy \u2014 all the while knowing there was no way LeEco would actually be able to make good on the $2 billion transaction. \nVizio says LeEco failed to disclose its huge money problems during merger negotiations\nBut LeEco, Vizio claims, \u201cdesperately needed to either obtain the instant financial stability, credibility, and resources that a merger with Vizio would bring, or at least to create a widespread and dramatic public impression of their own financial health and well-being to grow or continue in business that would come with the announcement of such an intended merger.\u201d \nVizio accuses LeEco of failing to fully cover the $100 million buyers termination fee that was written into the deal; only $40 million has been handed over so far. Vizio also claims that LeEco accessed \u201cconfidential customer information\u201d after the merger was announced and used that data \u201cstrictly for its own purposes.\u201d\nAfter the merger fell apart, Vizio and LeEco announced that they would instead form a partnership that would result in two things. First, LeEco would bring some of Vizio\u2019s products to China. Second, Vizio would add a LeEco app to its television software. But even that arrangement failed to come together. Vizio says efforts to move forward with the joint venture were met with \u201cradio silence\u201d and that LeEco was really just trying to avoid paying the full breakup fee. \nNow, suing a China-based company in federal court might not prove very fruitful, so in a second lawsuit seeking $50 million, Vizio instead targets one of LeEco\u2019s subsidiaries, Le Technology, which operates out of California. In recent weeks, LeEco\u2019s chairman has had some assets frozen amid growing complaints from the company\u2019s creditors and partners. And Faraday Future, which LeEco\u2019s Jia Yueting holds a major investment in, has cancelled plans for an electric car factory that was planned for Nevada. \n"}
