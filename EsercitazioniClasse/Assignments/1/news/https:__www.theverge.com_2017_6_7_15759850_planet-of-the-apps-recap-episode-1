{"title": "Rise of the Planet of the Apps: startup lessons from episode 1", "content": " \nApple\u2019s debut video series, Planet of the Apps, is a showcase for entrepreneurs hoping to raise money for their startups, aided by a quartet of celebrity coaches. Each week, we\u2019ll consider the things they do right \u2014 and the things they should have done much, much differently.\nThe debut episode of Planet of the Apps plays more or less as promised \u2014 a tech-focused Shark Tank spliced with elements of The Voice. Over the course of 49 minutes, we dive deep with the founders behind two companies and follow them from their first pitch to a meeting with an honest-to-goodness venture capital firm. Guiding them along the way are celebrity judges Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.i.am, and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk.\nAlong the way, we get brief glimpses of less promising companies, including the founders of a memorably confusing app that displays dating profiles for people going to events. Alba and Paltrow rightly identify the app as a magnet for creeps, and Will.i.am is having none of what the founders are selling. (\u201cI have sisters. I don\u2019t want my sister and my cousin Mimi, who is hot, who looks like Beyonc\u00e9, to have any more pressure than she already has going to the club with a bunch of hawks and vultures swarming around.\u201d)\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my cousin Mimi, who is hot, to have any more pressure.\u201d\nEvery startup chosen to appear on the show gets a 60-second \u201cescalator pitch\u201d in which they describe their company to the celebrities as they descend. (This is by far the show\u2019s most gimmicky element, but I enjoyed the visual metaphor of idealistic young founders descending to level of reality TV.) If at least one celebrity wants to hear more, the startup gets to make a more complete pitch. At that point, any of the coaches can either back out or offer to help, The Voice-style. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coach then offers in-person mentoring to the founders in an effort to help them hone their pitch \u2014 although in the first episode, coaches Alba and Vaynerchuk spend most of their time looking like they regret ever offering their assistance. Alba persuades the founder she\u2019s working with, who makes an augmented reality interior design app called Pair, to change his business model, which flops with investors. Vaynerchuk comes across as the most savvy of the judges, if perpetually on the brink of an aneurysm. But he knows where to poke holes in the lies founders tell themselves, and he offers the most practical advice of anyone in the pilot.\nAs the episode concludes, the founders meet with partners from Lightspeed Ventures; its investments include Snap, GIPHY, and Nest. If the partners like what they see, they invest \u2014 at an unannounced valuation or percentage of ownership \u2014 and the founders cry out in ecstasy and embrace everyone on the stage as the credits roll.\nsurprisingly low-rent\nFor all its Hollywood credentials, Planet of the Apps comes across as surprisingly low-rent. It unfolds with minimal visual flair, and many basic questions about the show go unanswered. How many developers applied to be a part of the show? How many were chosen? Will we ever see the winners again? Will cousin Mimi make an appearance? \nHere are some startup lessons from the episode one of Planet of the Apps.\nDO: Have a plausible growth strategy. Companion, a personal-safety app from recent college graduates Lexie Ernst and Jake Wayne, leverages your friend network to keep your safe while you\u2019re traveling home. What gets Lightspeed excited about the app is that Companion suggests you invite at least three friends to keep track of you on your way home \u2014 and one of those friends, on average, becomes an active Companion user. Good!\nDON\u2019T: Change your business model because Jessica Alba tells you to. Pair\u2019s Andrew Kemendo arrives on Planet with an e-commerce app. Use your phone to virtually place furniture and other decorations in your home, and then buy them through the app. By the time Alba is done with him, he\u2019s pitching VCs on building an indoor 3D map of the world, which he will then monetize\u2026 somehow. No one is convinced, and he leaves without a check.\nDON\u2019T: Pitch just one VC firm. One of the weirder elements of Planet is that founders only get to pitch a single firm, at least on the show. Different investors have different strengths, and it\u2019s odd to have founders\u2019 fates all hinge on whether their app is good for the Lightspeed portfolio. One reason Shark Tank works is that its judges have a diverse set of skills; on Planet the adults are either famous people or partners at one consumer-focused VC firm. Other founders \u2014 and the show \u2014 would be wise to mix it up.\nDO: Take Gary Vaynerchuk with a grain of salt. Vaynerchuk spends most of the episode in a lather that Google has introduced Trusted Contacts, a feature similar to the Companion app that he has just agreed to advise. \u201cThis is a straight-up atomic bomb to their business,\u201d he says. It is then revealed that Companion was already testing a premium version of its service that goes far beyond Google\u2019s, and Lightspeed invests $1 million. Some atomic bomb!\nWe invite you to join us next week for further lessons from Planet of the Apps. \n\n"}
