{"title": "VSCO\u2019s stylish filters can now be applied to videos", "content": " \nVSCO is getting into video. Starting today, the photo filtering company is beginning to introduce video editing capabilities to its flagship app. Naturally, they\u2019ll revolve around filters. But there\u2019s one big downside: the video features are only being given to paying subscribers. TechCrunch first reported the update.\nFor now, at least, editing seems to be limited to coloring and grading an image. So you\u2019ll be able to apply filters and tweak aspects of a video like contrast and saturation, but it sounds like you won\u2019t be able to trim a clip or cut multiple clips together, making it a pretty basic tool.\nIt\u2019s $20 per year for extra filters and video tools\nStill, VSCO\u2019s photo filters often make for some great looking images. And if it can recreate that with video, it may well find some fans \u2014 there are certainly editors who\u2019d be happy to use VSCO\u2019s photo presets in Premiere if that were an option. The tools are only available on iOS for now, but they\u2019re supposed to launch on Android \u201csoon.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s likely there\u2019s more to come. VSCO says it\u2019s releasing an \u201cearly access version\u201d of the feature today, which implies that it isn\u2019t finished yet.\nUnfortunately, the feature is only being released to people who pay for VSCO\u2019s $19.99 per year membership program, called VSCO X, which basically just gives you access to a bunch of filters you can probably buy for cheaper than $20, as well as some bonus filters that you can\u2019t buy outright. While it\u2019s frustrating that free users won\u2019t be able to try out the video editing tools, keeping them exclusive to VSCO X certainly sounds like a good way to drive subscriptions.\nOn a somewhat related note, VSCO\u2019s UI remains entirely unintelligible.\n"}
