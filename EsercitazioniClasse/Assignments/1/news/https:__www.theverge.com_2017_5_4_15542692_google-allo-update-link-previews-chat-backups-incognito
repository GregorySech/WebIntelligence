{"title": "Google is still updating Allo, adding link previews, chat backups, and group incognito mode", "content": " \nGoogle has pushed another update to its Allo chat service today. The app has gained incognito mode for group chats, allowing those conversations to be fully encrypted. Google also added link previews and chat backups, according to a tweet from Amit Fulay, head of product for Allo and Duo.\nAllo is still lagging when it comes to adoption; according to the Google Play Store, Google\u2019s new flagship chat app has less than 50 million downloads, while its video chat counterpart Duo has passed that milestone. Then there\u2019s the matter of the web app, which was shown off back in February but still isn\u2019t available. At least Google hasn\u2019t given up on it yet. \nWith Hangouts turning into an enterprise play against Slack, Allo has to be a success in Google\u2019s complicated chat ecosystem. Or maybe it doesn\u2019t and Google will release another chat service.\n"}
