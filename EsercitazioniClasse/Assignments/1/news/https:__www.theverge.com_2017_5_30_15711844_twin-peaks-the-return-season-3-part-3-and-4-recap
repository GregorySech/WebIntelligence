{"title": "Twin Peaks Top 3: Can someone teach Agent Cooper how to Dougie?", "content": " \nWelcome to Twin Peaks Top 3, where I look at last night\u2019s episode(s) of Showtime\u2019s Twin Peaks revival and draw bad fan art of the top three most baffling moments that made an impression on me. If you\u2019re looking for actual analysis and fan theories, you can head over to Question Club, because you won\u2019t find any of that here. Twin Peaks has always been a polarizing show, making even fans like myself question their loyalty at times. At the end of each Top 3, I\u2019ll ask myself a question: \u201cDo I want to keep watching?\u201d Let\u2019s find out.\nThis Top 3 will cover episodes 3 and 4. It\u2019s coming to you late because I was trapped in the Black Lodge for exactly one day, and that day was Memorial Day. Onward!\nBaffling Moment #1: Michael Cera as Lucy and Andy\u2019s train-conductor-hat-loving son, Wally Brando\nTwin Peaks has its fair share of comedic, offbeat moments that go nowhere and are completely endearing, or that go nowhere and are eye roll-inducingly boring. I could have done without the bit implying that Lucy has spent the last 25 years living under a rock with no idea what cellphones are, because come on. But I enjoyed the random detour with perfectly cast Michael Cera. Not sure whether he\u2019ll be back for more episodes, but I\u2019m prayin\u2019!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaffling Moment #2: Agent Cooper is now a real-life Sim\nIn episode 3, we\u2019re introduced to a third version of Cooper, known as Dougie Jones. He\u2019s a family man who\u2019s strayed down the wrong path after winning the US Masters Tournament. Don\u2019t try to tell me he doesn\u2019t golf, because there\u2019s no other way to explain that hideous lime-green blazer. He also has a violent vomiting fit, and so does evil Tommy Wiseau Cooper. I\u2019m worried for both of them. Boys, what did you eat? Take some Tums. \nThis pukefest somehow allows the real Agent Cooper to float into Nevada through an electric socket, and he\u2019s now basically a real-life Sim: he completely lacks autonomy, has to be led around everywhere, and holds in his pee until he finally almost wets himself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaffling Moment #3: Twin Peaks is the new Nashville?\nWe now have three episodes which end with musical performances at the Bang Bang Bar, featuring Chromatics, The Cactus Blossoms, and Au Revoir Simone. I have to be honest and say I didn\u2019t know anything about these bands before they turned up on the show, but I\u2019m willing to bet money that most of these Twin Peaks townspeople haven\u2019t either. The crowd could be extras paid for by the production of ABC\u2019s The Bachelorette, and this could all just be an elaborate setup for one of those dates where the Bachelorette has a \u201cspecial surprise\u201d planned, and it\u2019s a private concert featuring a band no one\u2019s ever heard of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I want to keep watching?\nYes! I need to know who the mystery woman who can help Cooper is. Please let it be Audrey!\n"}
