{"title": "There\u2019s an app for \u2018reflecting\u2019 on your dates and turning them into data", "content": " \nMost people who are looking for love in a densely populated city have one problem: how (how?) to keep track of the many dozens of promising romantic options they have at any given time. I\u2019m sure you can relate. You\u2019re busy! You have time to date 12 people but not to think about whether you like them. Wow, finally, there\u2019s an app that gets it. \nEvolve, launched post-beta last month by a small team in Boston, is a \u201cdatings and relationships manager.\u201d It\u2019s pretty simple, and I guess a brilliant idea because these four dudes got $1 million in seed money for it.\nwow, finally\nEvery time you go on a date, you just rate qualities of the outing from 1 to 10, type in if you got a smooch, \u201cmore,\u201d or whether you\u2019d rather not say. (That\u2019s your business!) Then, you can rate the date spot (so others can learn from you), and, well, you know \u2014 rate the person you were with on a numeric scale. You can also add pros and cons, like \u201cTrustworthy,\u201d \u201cSketchy,\u201d \u201cAmbitious,\u201d or \u201cBaggage.\u201d It\u2019s cold, but what are you gonna do, trust your gut? Ridiculous, your gut is an idiot. That\u2019s how you got here.\nAccording to Evolve\u2019s promotional materials, you have been waiting for this all along: a chance to \u201cweigh your options,\u201d \u201creflect on your dates,\u201d and \u201csee your patterns.\u201d Just ask Stephanie Gold from New York, NY, who said exactly one of these things verbatim when they spoke to her:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add photos and basic info about people to the app manually, or you can take screenshots of their dating app profiles and let Evolve pull information out for you. That feature is admittedly fun to use and something I would do a lot if I were maybe just 18 months younger than I am right now.\nThe more info you input about a potential romantic partner over time, the more the app will tell you about whether you like them. And the more romantic partners you add to the app, the more it will be able to tell you about your \u201cpatterns.\u201d Evolve also gives you \u201cinsights\u201d based on the dating behaviors of other people your age, e.g., Are you getting as many second dates as everyone else? As many first-date hook-ups? Picking date spots that don\u2019t suck? Going on enough dates per month? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are done with someone you can move them to \u201cthe past,\u201d which is nice, I suppose, if you\u2019re not the sort of person that will haunt forever for no reason. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with just about every modern dating solution I\u2019ve ever heard of, this is obviously insane and nobody\u2019s feelings work this way. But then again, the same could be said of the world\u2019s most revered and time-honored dating solution \u2014 a high school cafeteria game of MASH. And that doesn\u2019t stop anyone from doing it, because it\u2019s super fun. Love is absolutely so dumb, there\u2019s no attempted solve for it that could be dumber. So that\u2019s nice.\nJokes aside, it is my responsibility to beg you not to actually use this app to make decisions about people. But I don\u2019t think it will hurt you to peruse Evolve\u2019s hilarious Instagram. It\u2019s what I imagine the world would look like if I did bath salts and then sat in an American Eagle for 12 hours. Very cool. \n\n  \n  Can't choose where to go on your date? Then don't! Bring your fancy dinner plans to your apartment with a classic fort date #dateidea A post shared by Evolve App for iPhone (@evolve_app) on Apr 21, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT\n\n\n\n(\u201cClassic fort date.\u201d) \nYou can download Evolve in the App Store if you want. I can\u2019t stop you.\n"}
