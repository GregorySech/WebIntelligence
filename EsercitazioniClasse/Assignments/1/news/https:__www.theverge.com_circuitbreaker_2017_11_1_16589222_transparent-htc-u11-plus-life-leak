{"content": " \nThe new HTC U11 Plus flagship phone looks like it will come in a translucent option as revealed in a hands-on video accidentally posted to Facebook, and spotted by Phandroid. The video has since been taken down, but not before copies were made and uploaded elsewhere. If you look closely at the image above, you\u2019ll see a circular coil beneath the shell that might be a component for wireless charging or NFC.\nWell-known leaker Evan Blass also tweeted that the HTC U11 Plus will come in black, silver, as well as translucent too. The video confirms that the U11 Plus will have a 6-inch display, a 4,000 mAh battery, and will come with 128GB of storage, though it\u2019s not known if other storage options will be available.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, T-Mobile leaked spec sheets and a user guide for the upcoming HTC U11 Life mid-range phone. According to the documents, the U11 Life will feature a 5.2-inch display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor, NFC, 16-megapixel front and rear cameras with face detection, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage with microSD expansion, and a 2,600 mAh battery.\nBoth models are water and dust resistant and will feature Edge Sense, where a user squeezes the sides of the phone to launch an app or other customizable function. The Edge Sense feature is similar to Google\u2019s implementation on the HTC-made Pixel 2 devices. The HTC U11 Life will ship with Android Nougat, while the Plus model will have Android Oreo.\nAccording to the video, the HTC U11 Plus will cost 849 Swiss Francs (around $848) and the HTC U11 Life is 349 Swiss Francs ($348).
