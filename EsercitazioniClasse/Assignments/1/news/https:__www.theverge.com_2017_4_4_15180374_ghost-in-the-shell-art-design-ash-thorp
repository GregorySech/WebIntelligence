{"title": "A closer look at the art behind the new Ghost in the Shell movie", "content": " \nThe new live-action version of Ghost in the Shell has its share of problems, but one thing it does get right is the look. From the shimmering holograms to the gritty urban backdrop, the film managed to bring the distinct cyberpunk aesthetic of the anime and manga into the real world. Much of that comes down to the artists who worked during the early stages of the production process to solidify the look. Today, artist and designer Ash Thorp released a sizzle reel detailing some of his own work on Ghost in the Shell, providing some insight into how key visual aspects of the film were developed.\nThe short clip provides a behind-the-scenes look at some early concepts and animation tests, as well as designs that were featured in the final version of the movie. It covers everything from the film\u2019s building-sized holograms (called \u201csolograms\u201d) to the retrofuturistic vehicles to the camouflage ability Major uses to appear invisible. (In addition to Thorp, the featured pieces also include work by concept artists Maciej Kuciara and Vitaly Bulgarov and designer Chris Bjerre.)\n\u201cI did my best to pay homage to the past.\u201d\n\u201cBy merging physical buildings with the solograms, old neon lights, and holograms, I aimed to paint a multi-layered facade over the city to bring it to life,\u201d Thorp says of his work. \u201cI wanted it to feel as if the viewer was taking a psychedelic journey wavering between the realms of alternate reality and virtual reality.\u201d\nThorp \u2014 who previously worked on franchises like Prometheus and Call of Duty, and recently released his own short film called Lostboy \u2014 has also posted a treasure trove of concept art and design work on his site. It even includes a huge range of potential variations on the film\u2019s logo. \u201cI did my best to pay homage to the past,\u201d he says, \u201cyet bring a fresh look and feel for this new film.\u201d\n"}
