{"title": "Android users can now harness the power of neural networks to alter faces", "content": " \nLast month we told you about FaceApp, an iOS app that uses neural networks to tweak peoples\u2019 facial expressions. Now, it\u2019s available on Android, too; you can download it here from the Play Store. \nThe app is similar in technique to Prisma, which also uses neural networks to change photos; adding artistic filters in the style of famous painters or paintings. But while Prisma produces some pretty fantastic images, the changes it\u2019s making are only superficial \u2014 it doesn\u2019t actually alter the content of the photo, like FaceApp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe images produced by FaceApp aren\u2019t always convincing. \nPhoto: FaceApp / The Verge\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that FaceApp\u2019s results are always worth it. The app can add smiles, make a face look older or younger, and even swap genders; but its results are definitely hit-and-miss. As you can see above, the images it produces are hazy, low-quality, and sometimes just a little off.\n\n\njfc ban technology pic.twitter.com/i0RijzWYDv\u2014 easy d (@dcseifert) February 15, 2017\n\n\n\nStill, with Prisma, the AI work underpinning the app went from a research paper to turning up in Facebook\u2019s own filters in about a year. Using neural nets to alter images is only going to get more popular.  \n"}
