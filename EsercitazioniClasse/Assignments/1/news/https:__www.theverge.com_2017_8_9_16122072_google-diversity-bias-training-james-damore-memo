{"title": "Here\u2019s what Google\u2019s diversity and bias training looks like", "content": " \nJames Damore, formerly of Google, gave his first interview since the controversy around his internal memo erupted to \u201cmen\u2019s rights activist\u201d and alt-right ideologue Stefan Molyneux. In the interview on Tuesday, he said that he had written the memo\u2014which argues that women are underrepresented at Google due to biological differences\u2014after an upsetting experience at a \u201cdiversity program at Google.\u201d \n\u201cIt was ... not recorded, totally secretive,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard things that I definitely disagreed with in some of our programs. I had some discussions there. There was lots of just shaming and, 'No, you can't say that, that's sexist,' and, 'You can't do this.' There's just so much hypocrisy in the things they are saying. I decided to create the document to clarify my thoughts.\"\nSo what was the program that set off Damore? A person familiar with the matter tells The Verge that Damore attended a voluntary one-day summit around diversity and inclusion. The program was free for Googlers to attend, but they had to sign up for spaces in advance. Far from being secretive, some sessions were recorded and materials were sent out to participants after the summit. \nWhile we do not have the materials from that specific summit, the training that was offered was very standard, and may have overlapped with these slides and materials for Google\u2019s Bias Busting @ Work, a workshop to help address bias in the workplace. The workshop\u2019s resources are available publicly as part of re:Work, an open platform of HR materials used by Google. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exercise from Google\u2019s Bias Busting @ Work. \n\n\nDamore wrote in his memo that \u201c[a]t Google, we\u2019re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership.\u201d There are two presentations on re:Work that have to do with unbiasing. One is called Unconscious Bias @ Work, and the other is Bias Busting @ Work. The first has been filmed and publicly posted on YouTube with over a hundred thousand views.  \n\nThe second\u2014Bias Busting @ Work\u2014is more of a small workshop that takes place in a safe space, where participants are \u201csupposed to make mistakes.\u201d A slide in the deck reminds participants not to repeat what others say in the room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slide from Google\u2019s Bias Busting @ Work basic deck\n\n\nThe following slide explains that debating whether or not bias exists at Google is \u201coff-topic\u201d for the session.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe re:Work website only hosts a basic, customizable deck with an accompanying facilitator guide, so it\u2019s possible that the actual contents of the presentation vary in practice. The Bias Busting workshop doesn\u2019t appear to be a mandatory program for Google employees. \n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate, 8:21PM ET: This story has been updated with additional information regarding the program that former Google engineer James Damore attended.\n"}
