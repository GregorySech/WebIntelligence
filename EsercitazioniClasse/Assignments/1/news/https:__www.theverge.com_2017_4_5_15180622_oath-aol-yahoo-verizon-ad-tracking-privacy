{"title": "Oath isn\u2019t just a terrible name \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a nightmare ad-tracking machine", "content": " \nTwo seemingly unrelated things happened Monday that actually point directly at the future of the internet:\n1. Verizon was scooped into admitting that it\u2019s going to rename the combined zombie corpses of AOL and Yahoo \u201cOath,\u201d which is a terrible name that comes second only to Tronc.\n2. President Trump signed the bill that allows ISPs to share your browsing data without permission.\nThis is everything Verizon and AOL have been working toward over the past few years. Like every other broadband provider, Verizon wants to extract more revenue from its network by increasingly owning the media that travels over it. \nBut unlike AT&T (which bought DirecTV and is in the process of buying Time Warner) or Comcast (which bought NBCUniversal and invested in companies like BuzzFeed and our own Vox Media), Verizon\u2019s plan is far more lowbrow: it\u2019s going to churn out as much cheap content as it can from AOL and Yahoo and tell advertisers it can do a better job of delivering eyeballs because it has better ad-tracking capabilities than Google and Facebook.\nWhat Verizon wants, more than anything, is a piece of Google\u2019s ad business.\n\n\ntrack your device locations, browsing history to mine your behaviors, target you, gut net neutrality but also have a few pubs in house!\u2014 Jason Kint (@jason_kint) April 4, 2017\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new or small plan \u2014 it\u2019s been AOL CEO Tim Armstrong\u2019s vision for years now.  (Armstrong was the head of Google ad sales for years before taking over AOL.) AOL has been buying marketing and ad tech startups nonstop since Armstrong took over in 2009; they all have names that would cause normal, non-influencer humans to die in an explosion of pure shame. Millennial Media. RYOT. Adap.tv. Vidibile. Convertro. Buysight. Every single one of these companies is designed to better target advertising to you, the hapless AOL consumer.\nWhat Verizon wants, more than anything, is a piece of Google\u2019s ad business\nThen there\u2019s Armstrong\u2019s purchase of The Huffington Post, which now seems like just a prelude to his conquest of Yahoo. HuffPo was once the ultimate in cheap scale, generating millions of free contributor page views on which to place all that ad tech, but Yahoo is next-level cheap scale. People still use Yahoo as a homepage and primary search engine. They look up financial data. They play fantasy sports and dive into databases of stats. Something... happens on Tumblr. Yahoo Mail can\u2019t stop losing your passwords but it\u2019s still massive. Yahoo delivers millions and millions of pages that cost almost nothing to produce, all waiting to be strip-mined of data and retargeted with advertising.\nNone of this was a secret when Verizon bought AOL \u2014 the Ad Age headline was straight-up \u201cAd-Tech, not Content, Is King in the Verizon-AOL Deal.\u201d Can\u2019t be any clearer than that.\n\u201cThe ability to combine my browsing history and my location on the most personal and sensitive thing we own \u2014 the smartphone \u2014 with the tonnage inventory of AOL, MSN, and Yahoo is an interesting play,\u201d says Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group dedicated to better online advertising. \u201cThey know what they're doing. I just think it's bad for the marketplace overall.\u201d\nKilling net neutrality is next on the list\nAnd now, with the new privacy not-rules, Verizon is free to take the data generated from the tracking supercookies it imposes on its network customers, mash it up with AOL\u2019s ad stack, and promise advertisers hyper-targeted marketing information that can\u2019t be blocked or stopped because Verizon will own both the pipes and an enormous amount of the content flowing through it.\n\n\nVZ: We want to combine an ISP & ad networkDevil: Name your oath2 years later:VZ: You took care of Congress. We named it \"Oath\"Devil: \u2026 https://t.co/kUaN2cdEHk\u2014 Ben Thompson (@benthompson) April 4, 2017\n\n\n\nThe ISPs were explicit about what they wanted during the Congressional debates on the privacy rules \u2014 they have tons of consumer data because they own the pipes, and they want to be able to use that data without permission. Again, it wasn\u2019t even subtle.\n\n\nRep. Bill Flores (R, TX) just characterized this as \"leveling the playing field\" between ISPs and content companies (eg Verizon vs. FB)\u2014 tc (@chillmage) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nVerizon owns the networks that deliver the mobile data, along with lots of broadband internet to the home, plus the stores where many people buy their smartphones and the bloatware that runs on them. It wants to take the foundation and build itself up into an ISP, a content company, and an ad network, a corporate hydra that feeds on boardroom buzzwords like synergy and relevant content and generates names like Go90 and Oath. \nKint says Verizon\u2019s plans are \u201cvery concerning.\u201d \n\u201cAlthough Facebook and Google are clearly an [advertising] duopoly based on industry trends, Verizon, without net neutrality (their intention next) or privacy rules, is a chokepoint to consumer choice,\u201d he says. \u201cVerizon will be able to prioritize Oath's content. Imagine go90 getting priority over outside parties.\u201d\nAs a reminder, Go90 was the disastrous video service Verizon is now completely rebooting with the team from yet another acquisition. We made this video when Go90 came out; the product was such an obvious disaster we had to selectively decide which clueless bits to focus on.\n\n\n\n\nOath might fail the same way Go90 has failed; it\u2019s not like AOL and Verizon are terrific at executing these content-based ideas. But this is Verizon\u2019s next big plan to generate revenue and growth \u2014 it\u2019s a lot cheaper and simpler to extract revenue from hyper-targeted ads on the world\u2019s biggest content farm than it is to compete against AT&T and Comcast in broadband deployment. \n\u201cI've been vocal about Verizon's very active role in stripping any consumer privacy protection from the market. It lowers the bar for everyone including Facebook and Google. That\u2019s why the duopoly also reportedly supported the effort,\u201d says Kint. \n\u201cI expect even more ad blocking and less trust of digital advertising, which ends up harming everyone that matters, including marketers, publishers, and importantly consumers.\u201d\nWhatever happens with Oath, it\u2019s not a joke \u2014 it\u2019s the beginning of a very important fight about ad tracking across the entire internet.\n"}
