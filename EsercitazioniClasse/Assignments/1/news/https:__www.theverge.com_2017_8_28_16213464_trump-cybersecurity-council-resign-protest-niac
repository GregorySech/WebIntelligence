{"title": "Members of Trump\u2019s cybersecurity council resign in protest", "content": " \nSeveral members of a White House cybersecurity council resigned last week in protest over President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the violence in Charlottesville and the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, among other issues. \nIn a resignation letter obtained by NextGov, eight members of the 28-person National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) said that the president\u2019s \u201cactions have threatened the security of the homeland I took an oath to protect.\u201d The letter states that the Trump administration is not \u201cadequately attentive to the pressing national security matters within the NIAC\u2019s purview,\u201d and that Trump has paid \u201cinsufficient attention\u201d to the growing threats that the US faces to its cybersecurity. \nA \u201cdisregard for the security of American communities.\u201d\nThe letter also points to Trump\u2019s failure to condemn neo-Nazis and white nationalists following this month\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, as well as his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, which the signees cite as evidence of the president\u2019s \u201cdisregard for the security of American communities.\u201d   \n\u201cThe moral infrastructure of our Nation is the foundation on which our physical infrastructure is built,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s actions undermine that foundation.\u201d \nThree Obama-era officials \u2014 DJ Patil, Cristin Dorgelo, and Christy Goldfuss \u2014 confirmed their resignations from the council on Twitter over the weekend. Eight names were removed from the NIAC website, Defense One reports.\nEstablished in 2001 under an executive order from President George W. Bush, the NIAC advises the president on critical infrastructure security. Last week\u2019s resignations came ahead of a new NIAC report that called for the US to strengthen its cyber defense systems, adding that the current state of US infrastructure is a in a \u201cpre-9/11 moment.\u201d (Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta used similar language to describe the state of US cybersecurity infrastructure in 2012.)\nTwo White House business councils were disbanded earlier this month after several executives raised concerns over Trump\u2019s response to the Charlottesville violence.     \n\n"}
