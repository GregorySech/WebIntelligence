{"title": "Nokia 6 is now available on Amazon for $179.99 if you love lock screen ads", "content": " \nThe Nokia 6 showed up in China in January, but now it's available in the US on Amazon.com. The low-end phone has a retail price of $229, but if you want to subject yourself to Amazon's lock screen ads and offers, you can get the subsidized version for $179.99, as spotted by Phandroid.\nThe unlocked handset works on AT&T and T-Mobile. To get the discount you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member, and the Prime version also includes preinstalled Amazon apps and Prime services like Prime Music, Prime Photos storage, and of course Amazon Video. The best news, though, is you can always pay Amazon $50 to get rid of the ads if they\u2019re bugging you.\nIf you spring for the $229 version, you get pure Android 7.1 with nothing on top. Not a bad deal for a Snapdragon 430 phone with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 5.5-inch 1080p display. Just remember that this isn't your father's Nokia: the phone is built by HMD Global, who now owns the rights to Nokia phone branding.\n\nPoll\nWhich version would you get, if you had to choose?\n\nThis poll is closed.\n\n\n25%\nThe one with ads\n(615 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n74%\nI\u2019ve already seen Mozart in the Jungle\n(1797 votes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        2412 votes total\n      \nVote Now\n\n\n\n"}
