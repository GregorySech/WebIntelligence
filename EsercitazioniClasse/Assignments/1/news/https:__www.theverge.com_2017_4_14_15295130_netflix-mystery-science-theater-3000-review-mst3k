{"title": "Netflix\u2019s Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival is as funny (and necessary) as the original", "content": " \nIn November 2015, Mystery Science Theater 3000 creator Joel Hodgson announced a Kickstarter campaign to help bring the show back. After the initial wave of excitement subsided, fans and skeptics started asking questions. Would this be a reunion of the original cast and crew? If so, what would \u201coriginal\u201d mean, given that during its 11-year run, MST3K cycled through different casts and hosts, with Hodgson giving way to Mike Nelson in the lead role? Most importantly: Since Hodgson and his old collaborators were still making good money by mocking cheesy old movies with the Cinematic Titanic live show and DVDs, and the RiffTrax audio commentaries, did the world really need another Mystery Science Theater? \nThrough interviews and Kickstarter updates, Hodgson clarified. The revival would keep the same basic format that worked so well from 1988 to 1999, with mad scientists forcing a jumpsuited goofball and his robot friends to endure the worst of B-cinema. But while previous cast and crew members were welcome to drop by and pitch in, Hodgson would hire a fresh host, comedian Jonah Ray \u2014 and Ray would tap two of his pals, Hampton Yount and Baron Vaughn, to be the new voices of familiar protagonist \u2019bots Crow and Tom Servo. \nSkeptics remained skeptical. But fans were intrigued enough to break a Kickstarter record, pledging more than $6 million to finance 14 new episodes. Netflix struck a deal to release the new season, which debuts Friday, April 14. And judging by the first of the new batch \u2014 a righteous, hilarious skewering of the 1961 Danish monster movie Reptilicus\u2014there won\u2019t be a lot of buyers\u2019 remorse.\n\nAfter the Netflix logo fades, the latest iteration of MST3K serves up an immediate nostalgic callback to the show\u2019s old opening recommendation: \u201cTurn down your lights (where applicable).\u201d Then, after a lengthy bit of backstory introducing Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as the new \u201cmads,\u201d Kinga Forrester and \u201cTV\u2019s Son of TV\u2019s Frank,\u201d Reptilicus begins, and Ray, Yount, and Vaughn start tossing out rapid-fire references to everything from Finding Nemo to The Wicker Man to Jacques Tati to Prince. They even trot out old Mystery Science Theater in-jokes, shouting \u201cRat Patrol! In color!\u201d when an army vehicle rolls onto the screen, and \u201cDiarrhea is like a storm raging inside of you\u201d over a shot of a roiling ocean.\nThough Hodgson and company could\u2019ve taken advantage of Netflix\u2019s commercial-free  open-endedness, they\u2019ve made a version of the show that could\u2019ve aired 25 years ago: 90 minutes long, with regular breaks, and with host segments that feature songs, sketches, letters from fans, and even an \u201cinvention exchange.\u201d It feels like 1992 all over again. Should it feel like 1992, here in 2017? Answering that means understanding what made MST3K matter in the first place.\nNetflix\u2019s new MST3K feels like 1992 all over again\nConventional wisdom has the debut of The Sopranos on HBO in 1999 as the beginning of TV\u2019s new golden age, but the decade leading up to that moment was filled with exciting, entertaining experiments with the medium, spurred by a boom in cable channels. In the 1980s, cable had emerged as a home for sports, public-affairs programming, and repeats of old TV shows or movies. In the 1990s, increased competition prompted a demand for material that could make channels stand out from the pack. Soon, between Beavis & Butt-head on MTV, Iron Chef on Food Network, Space Ghost: Coast to Coast on Cartoon Network, The Kids in the Hall on HBO, and a hearty assortment of other clever cartoons, sketch shows, game shows, and offbeat genre hybrids, telephiles had good reason to jump around the dial. \nHodgson concocted Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1988 while living in Minnesota, on a break from his thriving career as a prop comic. In its nascent form on the Minneapolis UHF station KTMA, the show was a hodgepodge of goofy, geeky ideas. It was a little bit old-fashioned monster-movie matinee, a little bit DIY puppetry, a little bit local-TV kids\u2019 show, and a little bit retro science-fiction saga. By the time the then-fledgling Comedy Central picked up the series, Hodgson and his creative team had a keener sense of how to balance original material with the weekly grind of watching a crummy old film, and they\u2019d discovered that if they wedged in as many jokes as possible, they could throw in some that only a select few would get.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComedy Central\n\n\nThat\u2019s one big reason for the affection and outright devotion so many people feel for this show. It was a rinky-dink series, produced in the middle of the country, by smart, funny people who hadn\u2019t been ground through the mill of either New York or Los Angeles showbiz. It connected with the sprawling subcultures of geeks and pop obsessives, many of whom had the same media diets, nerdy backgrounds, and schlubby Midwestern fashion sense as the performers on the screen. MST3K\u2019s barrage of references to everything from old cartoons to rock music to art-cinema allowed anyone who\u2019d just stumbled across the show to take ownership, because the show felt like it was made by people just like them. As internet bulletin boards became more popular, viewers connected with each other, sharing favorite jokes, swapping tapes, and spreading the word to potential fans. Mystery Science Theater became one of the first original cable programs that critics latched onto, hailing it as equal to or even better than network TV programming.\nMST3K was one of the first original cable programs greeted as equal to network TV shows\nHodgson stepped down from the show in 1993, in the middle of its fifth Comedy Central season, after it became an established cult hit. He left behind a well-oiled machine that kept churning out hilarious episodes without him, even as other cast members left and ratings declined. The series shifted to the SCI FI Channel until 1999, when it was cancelled. But Mystery Science Theater 3000 never really went away. It disappeared from television until recently, when a healthy handful of the first decade-plus of episodes returned to syndication (and occasionally to Netflix). But first Rhino and then Shout! Factory kept the home-video market steadily supplied with VHS tapes and DVDs, which the cast and crew promoted at conventions and special events, between their new movie-riffing endeavors.\nMeanwhile, the success of the basic MST3K formula \u2014 adding jokes to cheaply acquired pre-existing footage \u2014 inspired other comedians to follow suit. MST3K disciples produced overt homages like ESPN Classic\u2019s Cheap Seats, which had twin stand-up comics Jason and Randy Sklar riffing on some of the goofiest clips in the archives of sports broadcasting. The 1990s and 2000s spawned Talk Soup and its successor The Soup, where the worst of reality TV became fodder for snarky commentary. YouTube has spawned its own industry of post-MST3K smart-alecks, gleefully trashing everything from video games to movie trailers. What is a \u201cCinema Sins\u201d or \u201cEverything Wrong With [Movie]\u201d YouTube video but a MST-like skewering, minus the silhouettes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComedy Central\n\n\nBut Netflix\u2019s revival version grasps something that most of the copycats miss: Mystery Science Theater was never just about sneering. The new Jonah Ray version of the series recaptures the original version\u2019s handmade, \u201cHey kids, let\u2019s put on a show\u201d charm. The sets and effects look fussed-over and intricately detailed, but also inexpensive enough that any diligent, gifted community-theater tech could\u2019ve pulled them off. During the first break in Reptilicus, Ray and the \u2019bots launch into a Hamilton-esque rap (penned by nerdcore songwriting duo Paul Sabourin and Storm DiCostanzo) about giant monsters around the world. In that song, Ray, Yount, and Vaughn hit every tricky, rapid-fire aural cue, but also knock over props and sing like spirited amateurs. The presentation throughout the first new episode is smart and energetic, but not always slick.\nThe main thing the Netflix MST3K gets right is the original\u2019s giddy media deconstruction. During Reptilicus, there are jokes about the movie\u2019s slow pace (\u201cFeel free to begin the scene any time, guys\u201d), and about the stock characters and casual sexism (\u201cBrigadier General Military Industrial Complex, this is Miss Doctor Woman\u201d). Ray and the \u2019bots have some fun with the poor quality of the source material itself (\u201cEither this print is in really bad shape, or it\u2019s raining tar\u201d), and the movie\u2019s distinctly Danish setting (\u201cProtect the parfumerie!\u201d).\nMST3K taught viewers to watch the screen closely for details\nThis is what the original Mystery Science Theater 3000 did at its best: It taught viewers to look closely at the small details of what they were seeing on-screen, not just to make fun, but so they wouldn\u2019t be lulled into shutting their brains off whenever a film turned tedious. By making jokes about establishing shots, transitions, set design, and the like, the show has always encouraged its audience to grapple with the totality of a piece of entertainment, and to question even the basic visual tools it uses to impart information. In this age, when we\u2019ve all become more anxious about whether we\u2019re being misled by the mainstream media, that kind of fine attention is crucial. Watching MST3K is a fun way to sharpen our eyes.\n\u201cFun\u201d would be reason enough for this revival to exist. But what\u2019s so heartening about the new MST3K is that Hodgson and his latest crew know being silly doesn\u2019t excuse being lazy. So they\u2019re attentive, attuned, and always on the lookout for a topper to every gag. About halfway through Reptilicus, Tom Servo remarks that a character playing chess looks a little like Andrew Lloyd Webber. That\u2019s pretty funny. Ray then starts idly singing one of Webber\u2019s songs, as though the character actually is Webber. That\u2019s even funnier. And because the chess-player keeps putting his hand over his lips while contemplating his next move, Ray muffles the song whenever the character\u2019s mouth is covered, and sings out when it\u2019s not.\nThat, friends, is a Mystery Science Theater 3000 joke. It draws an observant pop-culture reference from an unrelated project, then reintegrates it into the original material, so that for a few seconds, a throwaway moment in a throwaway movie becomes something surprising, amusing, and wonderfully weird. It\u2019s what the show has always done best, from 1988 to now.\n\n"}
