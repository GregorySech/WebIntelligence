{"title": "Apple is fixing the most annoying thing about CarPlay in iOS Beta 10.3", "content": " \nWhen Apple designed CarPlay for iOS, it decided to stick with a familiar paradigm: a home button that takes you to a simple home screen of icons. That\u2019s not a terrible idea \u2014 the interface is simple and familiar to everybody, and you don\u2019t want to be struggling with a touchscreen when you\u2019re supposed to be keeping your eyes on the road.\nHowever, think about the two main things you have on a car dashboard: you glance at a map and you control your music. Currently, in order to switch between those tasks you have to tap twice: once for home, and then again for the other app. That\u2019s not a  huge problem, but it does mean extra time looking away from the road. It also could be a hassle if you don\u2019t recall where your music app icon is (or if you don\u2019t have \u201cNow Playing\u201d on your main home screen).\nCarPlay feels more like it\u2019s made for a car now\nWell, with the public beta that Apple is letting users test right now, that problem is fixed. Now, instead of a single icon in the upper left-hand corner, there are three. They list your recent apps and are a much faster, easier way to switch between them. This has been around on the beta since January 24th, but it\u2019s so helpful that I wanted to call it out on its own rather than let it be missed while everybody else pays attention to the Find My Airpods feature.\nIt\u2019s not a huge change, but it is a welcome one. And it\u2019s also a sign that Apple is thinking a little more clearly about making interfaces native to their situations. The iOS home button paradigm is simple, but slapping it on a car dashboard always felt a little lazy to me. When you\u2019re driving, you want quick \u201cOne button, one function\u201d interfaces, and this new update to CarPlay gets us just a little closer to that.\n"}
