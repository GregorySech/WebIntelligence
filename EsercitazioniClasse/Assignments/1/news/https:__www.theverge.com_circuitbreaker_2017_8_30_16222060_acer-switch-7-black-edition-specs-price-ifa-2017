{"title": "Acer\u2019s new fanless 2-in-1 has Intel\u2019s latest processors and discrete Nvidia graphics", "content": " \nAcer is introducing what it calls the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d fanless 2-in-1 notebook with discrete graphics today at IFA in Berlin. The new Switch 7 Black Edition is the latest in the Switch range, and includes a 13.5-inch display (2256 x 1504) and Intel\u2019s 8th-generation Core i7 processor inside a brushed-aluminum exterior. Acer has also included Nvidia\u2019s MX150 GPU, all while keeping the weight less than 2.5 pounds.\nWhile the Switch 7 looks a lot like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro device, Acer has included its own automatic kickstand that can be automatically deployed or retracted with a single hand. (You just press the bottom of the display down on any hard surface and the stand flips out.) \nThe screen also includes Wacom stylus support, and a fingerprint reader that\u2019s under the glass and will boot up the PC and sign into Windows 10 thanks to its Windows Hello support. Acer is planning to make the Switch 7 Black Edition available in December, starting at $1,699.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
