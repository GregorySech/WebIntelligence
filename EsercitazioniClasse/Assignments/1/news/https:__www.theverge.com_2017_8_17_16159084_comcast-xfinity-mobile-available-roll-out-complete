{"title": "Comcast's Xfinity Mobile is now available in all the company's markets", "content": " \nNearly three months after it first started rolling out, Comcast has now officially completed its release of Xfinity Mobile. The mobile phone service is available in all of Comcast's service areas, both through retail stores and online at XfinityMobile.com.\nAs a reminder, the service is only available to Xfinity Internet customers, who can pay as low as $45 per month per line for unlimited data (up to five lines), although speeds are reduced after 20GB a month. Comcast also offers pay-as-you-go service for $12 per gigabyte. Every customer initially receives 100MB of shared data across their lines. The service supports the most recent iPhones, as well as the most recent Samsung Galaxy devices. \nComcast is renting wireless space from Verizon, so technically, customers are on Verizon's network and should have service across the country. Phones on Xfinity Mobile won't always be on the network, though, and when possible, they'll automatically connect to nearby Wi-Fi hotspots so data use is curbed. Anyway, if you're a loyal Comcast customer who tends to be around Wi-Fi hotspots, maybe this is a plan worth considering.\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.\n"}
