{"title": "Evidence grows for new Apple TV with 4K and HDR support", "content": " \nAn Apple TV with 4K and HDR support has been rumored for months, if not years, but it seems like Apple may finally be gearing up to release an updated version of its set-top streaming box. According to a new report from MacRumors, iTunes is beginning to list movies as supporting 4K and HDR in users\u2019 purchase histories, implying that Apple\u2019s digital storefront \u2014 and likely, its devices \u2014 could be supporting higher-quality videos soon. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nApple TV 4K review: so close, so far\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no way to actually download movies in 4K or HDR through iTunes at this time; it just simply shows up in purchased history for now. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that Apple would even unintentionally have added the tags if it wasn\u2019t working to offer 4K and HDR videos sometime in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: MacRumors\n\n\nAccording to the MacRumors report, the tags are showing up on films such as Passengers  and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which would imply that, if the rumor is true, both Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. Studios are on board to offer the higher-resolution movies in some way. \nSince Apple usually announces a slate of new hardware in the fall for the upcoming holiday season, it\u2019s likely that, if there is a new Apple TV on the horizon, we\u2019ll be hearing about it sooner rather than later. \n"}
