But today, for the first time since their inception in the late \u201890s, the band gave a live on-camera interview. \n\u201cFear was one of the biggest emotions\u201d\nDamon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett appeared (as 2D and Murdoch) on MistaJam\u2019s Radio 1 show this morning, which was streamed live on YouTube, Dazed reports. Over the course of the 30-minute interview, 2D and Murdoch answered viewer-submitted questions about their upcoming album Humanz, smartphones (\u201cWe never had smartphones when we were starting out, and now we do\u201d), and Donald Trump.  \nAlbarn and Hewlett never break character, with 2D insisting that he was kidnapped by Murdoch in order to make this album. \u201cIt was very emotional for us,\u201d 2D says of the band\u2019s creative process. \u201cFear was one of the biggest emotions, and frustration... emasculation is another one.\u201d \nYou can watch the entire joyful, goofy thing above. Humanz is out next Friday.\n"}
