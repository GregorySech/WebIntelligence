{"title": "The OnePlus 5 gets a software update fixing the 911 reboot bug", "content": " \nOnePlus has issued a software update that fixes the 911 issue that some OnePlus 5 users were reportedly experiencing earlier this week. \nMake sure to update ASAP\n\"We have begun rolling out the software update. Timing may vary by region,\u201d a OnePlus representative said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cWe encourage OnePlus 5 users to download the update. If users haven't received a notification, check for the update by going to \u201cSettings\u201d > \u201cSystem Updates.\u201d\nThe update, which should be rolling out to OnePlus 5 owners now, fixes the problem where the recently released smartphone would reboot instead of calling emergency services. Given the critical importance of being able to call 911 (or 999 in the UK), it\u2019s good to see that OnePlus has managed to solve the issue in an appropriate timeline.\n"}
