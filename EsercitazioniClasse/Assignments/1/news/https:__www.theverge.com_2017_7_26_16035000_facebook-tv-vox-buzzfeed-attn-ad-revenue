These will be inexpensive, five- to 10-minute shows that are owned by the media companies that have partnered with Facebook, with 45 percent of ad revenue going to the latter. \nA Facebook spokesperson declined to comment.\nBy contrast, Facebook\u2019s future TV content that it plans to launch later on will be 20- to 30-minute shows owned solely by Facebook. Some of the partnered media companies include Group Nine Media, BuzzFeed, ATTN, and Vox Media (which owns The Verge). \nFacebook TV will be middlebrow\nThese TV shows were originally expected to be released in June, but then were delayed to near August, and \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d told Bloomberg that further delays could still occur.\nFacebook TV will be middlebrow entertainment, coming in just above homemade YouTube videos, but well below the likes of Netflix and HBO.
