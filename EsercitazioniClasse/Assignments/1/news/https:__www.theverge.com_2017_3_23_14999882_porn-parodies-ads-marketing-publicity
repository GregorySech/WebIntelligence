{"title": "Why porn PR is rarely about the porn", "content": " \nOver the past few decades, the gap between the adult industry and mainstream culture has grown ever narrower. But you wouldn\u2019t necessarily notice this from porn\u2019s coverage. As popular as the films produced by smut peddlers might be, mainstream news outlets are unlikely to cover the latest edition of Big Booty Moms or Barely Legal; when porn winds up in the media, it\u2019s more as a punchline than the subject of serious reportage or criticism. That is to say, porn isn\u2019t the easiest thing to promote.\nOf course, porn public relations isn\u2019t impossible. Brian Gross \u2014 who transitioned to porn PR after a few years as a music publicist \u2014 notes that, whether he was persuading music reviewers to give an unknown act a listen, or encouraging mainstream media to write up some of the world\u2019s most beloved porn performers, he was doing \u201cthe same type of publicity.\u201d Namely it was a very aggressive, very creative sort of strategizing.\nOf course, there was still one big difference: while Gross might eventually get reviewers to write up the music performed by one of his more obscure acts, it\u2019d be next to impossible to get a straight review for the work of even the world\u2019s most famous porn star. While music publicity is always, fundamentally, about the music, adult industry publicity is very rarely about the actual porn, a reality that\u2019s helped fuel porn PR\u2019s reputation for stunts targeting the lowest common denominator and press releases hyping their own inherent wackiness, rather than a viable, compelling product. \nIn the past, porn publicity was a business of stunts\nDuring the years that I spent writing for porn blog Fleshbot, I became intimately acquainted with this sort of press release, which most commonly took the form of a seven-figure porn contract offered to whatever beleaguered celebrity happened to be in the news. Google \u201cVivid offers 1 million\u201d and you\u2019ll turn up a plethora of these stunts, as everyone from Nadya \u201cOctomom\u201d Suleman to Pippa Middleton to Ted Cruz has been turned into fodder for the adult industry public relations machine.\nThese days, sites like Pornhub make splashy announcements about shooting porn in space or plowing streets overrun with snow, only to largely abandon these efforts as soon as the earned media value has run out. For many people \u2014 especially beleaguered members of the press exhausted by press releases announcing things like Pornhub-branded lube, Pornhub promoting the cause of pet sterilization awareness, and a service nobody wants that involves texting emoji to receive porn \u2014 porn promotion doesn\u2019t do much to challenge the adult industry\u2019s reputation as a seedy business with a primary focus on immediate gratification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Pornhub\n\n\nBut while these cheap ploys for attention are certainly a part of how the adult industry courts mainstream attention \u2014 Adella, founder of FAM, notes that doing stunts \u201cmakes [clients] happy and they like it and it\u2019s easy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s inaccurate to reduce the entirety of porn PR to empty press grabs. Mike Stablie, whose clients include Kink.com and xHamster, compares this sort of strategy to a \u201csugar rush\u201d and notes that \u201cstunt PR fades pretty quickly, and I don\u2019t think that it contributes a lot to the overall conversation around sex and sexuality.\u201d\nPorn publicists want to improve the convo around sex\nThis, despite the adult industry\u2019s reputation, is actually pretty important to many people working in porn PR. While it\u2019s easy to get quick hits off of outreach that plays up the shocking, taboo nature of sexually explicit media, that doesn\u2019t do much for the long-term health of the industry, which benefits far more from mainstream respect than the \u201cedgy\u201d cred of being part of an aggressively stigmatized industry. \nAdella tells me that she always tries to pitch an angle \u201cthat isn\u2019t just about porn, or isn\u2019t just about sex, but is about creating a dialogue in our society about the evolution of our sexuality and female empowerment.\u201d In a similar vein, Stabile sees porn publicity as a way to fill in the gaps in our cultural conversation around sex. \u201cSexuality is not something that is adequately studied,\u201d he tells me, noting that government funding for sex research is virtually nonexistent. \u201cPorn companies are one of the few places that hold this data. What I try to do when I work with a company is to try to figure out what that data tells us, even if it\u2019s imperfect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStabile knows that Kink.com isn\u2019t a research institute, but he still feels that, for instance, the site\u2019s periodic report on the \u201ckinkiest cities in the US\u201d \u2014 which combines Kink.com\u2019s own data, information from FetLife\u2019s membership database, and sales data from retailers like Doc Johnson \u2014 offers a useful entry point for conversations around nonnormative sexual identities. A recent effort by xHamster, which responded to Utah\u2019s decision to nix comprehensive sex education by redirecting their Utahn xHamster visitors to their sex ed-focused YouTube series, is another example of what Stabile thinks of as \u201cusing porn for good.\u201d There\u2019s no denying that press attention is the ultimate goal here (Kink.com isn\u2019t assembling that report just for their own enjoyment), but for many porn PR reps, the potential to encourage much-needed discussions about sex is a significant component.\n\u2018Ask a Porn Star\u2019 hopes to destigmatize the industry\nGross highlights WoodRocket\u2019s Ask A Porn Star video series, which he compares to Us Weekly\u2019s \u201cStars \u2013 They\u2019re Just Like Us\u201d feature, as another attempt to bring press attention to porn by helping to normalize and demystify sex and the sex industry \u2014 and also the people who work within it. For WoodRocket founder Lee Roy Myers, the series taps into people\u2019s curiosity about what he refers to as \u201cthe human side of sex.\u201d As the novelty of easy-access to porn has worn off, curiosity about the day-to-day experiences of people who make porn has grown. Myers sees the popularity of Ask A Porn Star as a piece of the rise of \u201cnormal\u201d porn performers like Sasha Grey, who stood in contrast to the more outr\u00e9 stars who gained mainstream popularity in the 1990s, like Jenna Jameson, the epitome of the big-breasted blonde archetype, and the hirsute, rotund Ron Jeremy, who represented the other extreme pornstar stockplayer. (Disclosure: I briefly consulted for WoodRocket in 2013 and 2014.)\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that all of WoodRocket\u2019s press-friendly projects are aimed at highlighting the \u201cnormal\u201d side of sex and porn. Since its inception, WoodRocket \u2014 which may be the most frequently covered porn site, save for the omnipresent Pornhub \u2014 has drawn copious attention for its porn parodies, which run the gamut from almost too obvious (2013\u2019s Game of Bones) to the aggressively weird (SpongeKnob SquareNuts, the viral video that helped launch the site). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Woodrocket\n\n\nThe appeal that these parodies hold is pretty obvious: unlike most porn films, parodies are able to completely crack the mainstream / adult barrier, getting write-ups and reviews in venues that typically focus on non-adult entertainment. Publications peg the story on the safe, mainstream property, while knowingly smirking at the porn side of the equation. Tellingly, Vivid began putting energy into their parody line around the time that celebrity sex tapes began to fall out of favor \u2014 both genres allow porn to ride the coattails of the mainstream entertainment industry, albeit approaching mainstream celebrity and popularity from slightly different angles.\nBut while Myers knows that famous \u201cTV show + porn\u201d is an easy recipe for press attention \u2014 \u201cWe could get away with bare minimum,\u201d he tells me, noting that even just a photo of a porned-up SpongeBob would probably merit mention somewhere, from someone \u2014 he sees full-scale parody projects, which devote a good deal of time and attention into crafting something that\u2019ll appeal to fans of the original property, as more than a ploy for press coverage.\nThe media prefers to cover porn indirectly\n\u201cUntil you make a SpongeKnob SquareNuts aimed at getting press attention, you don\u2019t know how much you like making SpongeKnob SquareNuts,\u201d he tells me. It\u2019s the genuine enjoyment he derives from creating XXX parodies that blend the boundaries between sexy and ridiculous that fuels his passion for these projects. Which, he muses to me, may be why his projects get the attention of the press: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a scam with us\u2026 We just make stuff that we want to make.\u201d And so exists an alternative to traditional porn PR: where press stunts served themselves, now they inspire films that creators like to make and viewers like to watch.\nWhich ties back to the key point when it comes to getting press attention for a supposedly untouchable subject like porn. As Gross puts it, \u201cIf you have a good story to tell, then you have the opportunity for it to be published.\u201d Mainstream media may not be writing straight reviews of most hardcore porn \u2014 and, at least in the immediate future, they probably never will \u2014 but as long as adult industry publicists are able to find an interesting angle that helps bridge the gap between porn and the general public, they\u2019ll be able to help the uncoverable get covered. \n\n"}
