{"title": "Sony\u2019s Shawn Layden: \u2018Vita is still a viable platform\u2019", "content": " \nUnless you follow events like E3 closely, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that Sony\u2019s portable Vita platform is all but dead. After all, the handheld is rarely mentioned by the company anymore, and that\u2019s unlikely to change at this year\u2019s PlayStation E3 keynote on June 12th. But just because the Vita won\u2019t have much of a presence at gaming\u2019s biggest spectacle, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the platform is dead \u2014 especially if you ask Sony Interactive Entertainment America president and CEO Shawn Layden.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still my favorite portable.\u201d\n\u201cVita is still a viable platform,\u201d Layden says, \u201cchiefly in the Japanese and Asian markets. We still have developers in Japan who are building for that platform. But it just didn\u2019t get over the hump in Europe and America. It\u2019s hard to know exactly why, but it didn\u2019t garner a large enough audience here for us to continue to build for it.\u201d\nThat said, the spirit of the Vita still lives on in a way through the Nintendo Switch. The portable / console provides a more seamless way to play games both at home and on the go. It has also become an increasingly popular destination for indie games, much as the Vita used to be. Whatever happens with the Vita in the future, though, know it has at least one big fan inside Sony. \u201cIt\u2019s still my favorite portable,\u201d says Layden. \u201cIt travels with me all the time, and I play Hot Shots Golf consistently.\u201d\n"}
