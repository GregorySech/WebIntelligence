{"title": "Instagram begins letting you hide all those hideous overly filtered pics from 2012", "content": " \nNot all of your Instagram pics are winners, and Instagram knows it. So the company has started testing a feature that lets you hide your published photos, keeping them tucked away in a private section of your profile that only you can view. Photos can later be unhidden and returned to their proper place in your profile, too.\nInstagram refers to the new feature as your \u201cArchive,\u201d and the ability to \u201carchive\u201d photos is starting to appear in the \u201c...\u201d menu where you could previously go to edit, share, and delete photos.\nYour embarrassing photos can be restored if you have a change of heart\nIn fact, \u201carchive\u201d shows up as the first option in that menu, and not because it\u2019s first alphabetically: the archive option doubles as a way to keep people from deleting their photos. You\u2019re still able to fully delete a picture if you want to. But with the archive, you have the option of hanging on to slightly embarrassing pictures that you may still want to see again.\nInstagram users are able to browse photos in their archive just like any other part of their profile. From inside the archive, photos can also be restored to your profile page so that everyone\u2019s able to see them again. It\u2019s a minor feature, but it seems like it could be helpful here and there.\nThe archive option appears to have begun rolling out at least a couple days ago. And while several of us at The Verge have access, Instagram tells us the feature remains an \u201cearly test\u201d and that availability will expand in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d That makes it sound like this feature will eventually roll out to everyone, but Instagram seems to be leaving the door open for giving up on the feature.\nWhen you get access, the archive will show up in the top right corner of your profile page in the app. A little pop-up will appear to highlight the new addition.\nUpdate May 23rd, 10:40AM ET: Instagram tells us the archive feature is just a test for now and is not rolling out to all users, as we previously speculated.\n"}
