{"title": "Asus leaks four new phones on its own website", "content": " \nAsus accidentally pushed new phone listings live on its French website this week, thereby leaking its own products. That's a bummer for the company, but good news for those of us who hate surprises. The leaks include the ZenFone 4, the ZenFone 4 Selfie, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro, and the ZenFone 4 Max. I'll break down the specs for each below, along with their listing. (Thanks to Android Police for gathering these screenshots.)\nZenFone 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinFuture\n\n\n\n5.5-inch full HD AMOLED display\nSnapdragon 630 processor \n4GB of RAM with 64GB of expandable storage\n3,300mAh battery \nDual rear-facing camera system comprised of one 12-megapixel sensor and one 8-megapixel sensor; 8-megapixel front-facing camera\nAvailable in white and black\n\u20ac499 in France\n\nZenFone 4 Selfie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus\n\n\n\nSnapdragon 430 processor\n5.5-inch IPS 1280 x 720 display\n4GB of RAM with 64GB of expandable storage \n3,000mAh battery\nTwo front-facing cameras, one 20-megapixel sensor and one 8-megapixel sensor with a flash; 16-megapixel rear-facing camera\n \u20ac299.99 in France\n\nZenFone 4 Selfie Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus\n\n\n\nSnapdragon 625 processor\n5.5-inch full HD AMOLED display\n4GB RAM with 64GB of expandable storage\nDual front-facing cameras with 24-megapixel sensor and 5-megapixel sensor; 16-megapixel rear-facing camera\n\u20ac399.99 in France\n\nZenFone 4 Max\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsus\n\n\n\n5.2-inch IPS 1280 x 720 display\n3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage\n4,100mAh battery\nDual rear-facing cameras with 13-megapixel sensor and 5-megapixel sensor; 8-megapixel front-facing camera\n\u20ac229.99 in France\n\nAs a note: Asus already unveiled the ZenFone 4 Max in Russia earlier this year, but this French leak suggests a model with the same name will be released globally. The new version features a smaller battery and screen. This could get confusing.\nOverall, Asus appears to be giving customers lots of choice with its 2017 releases. The selfie phones are differentiated by their display and processor. The same goes for the ZenFone 4 and the ZenFone 4 Max. Users will have to decide which they value more \u2014 a front-facing or rear-facing camera system \u2014 and then from there, determine how much they want to spend. Seems simple enough, although this is certainly a lot of devices to show off at once.\n"}
