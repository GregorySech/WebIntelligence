{"title": "Google Calendar gets an iOS widget, nearly three years after widgets launched", "content": " \nGoogle Calendar users on iOS, rejoice: the official Google Calendar app for iPhone and iPad has finally gotten a Today widget, allowing you to preview upcoming events at a glance from the \u201cToday\u2019 section of the notification shade and lock screen, as spotted by 9to5Mac.  \nThe widget can show the next two events on your calendar, and expand to show another four. Like other Today widgets, the preview can also be accessed on iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 devices by pressing down with 3D Touch on the Google Calendar icon. \nThat\u2019s pretty much it. There\u2019s no way to show a full month view like the excellent Fantastical 2 does, which is one of the main reasons it remains my favorite iPhone calendar app. But if you\u2019ve been looking to have more easily accessible information from your Google Calendar, now you can. \nGoogle Calendar\u2019s Today widget update is available now on the App Store. \n"}
