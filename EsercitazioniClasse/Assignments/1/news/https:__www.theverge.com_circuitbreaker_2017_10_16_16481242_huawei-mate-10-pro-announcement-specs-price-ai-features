{"title": "Huawei's Mate 10 phones have big screens, small bezels, and AI hardware", "content": " \nHuawei has announced the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, two new phones that occupy the highest end of its lineup. The Mate 10 phones see the Chinese giant get on board with the skinny-bezel trend of 2017 while leveraging its ability in silicon design to supposedly improve AI-related performance.\nThe main difference between the two phones is in screen size and shape. The Mate 10 features a 5.9-inch 2560 x 1440 LCD while the Mate 10 Pro\u2019s display is a 6-inch 2160 x 1080 OLED; both have thin, symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom. The Pro feels like the smaller phone, however, due to the narrower 18:9 aspect ratio it shares with many of this year\u2019s similarly sized \u201cbezel-less\u201d phones. \nThe regular Mate 10\u2019s sharper 16:9 screen makes for an unusually proportioned device, albeit one that\u2019ll probably work well for YouTube and other casual video watching \u2014 it feels very wide in the hand, but the combination of a huge, standard aspect ratio screen with slim bezels lends a distinctive heft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\nBoth phones feature glossy glass construction and come in \u201cmocha brown\u201d or \u201cpink gold,\u201d with additional black and gold finishes for the Mate 10 and blue and gray colorways for the Pro. There\u2019s also a Porsche Design special edition Mate 10 Pro with a \u201cdiamond black\u201d finish.  The Mate 10 is 8.2mm thick and has a fingerprint sensor below the screen; the Pro is 7.9mm and has its fingerprint sensor around the back. The Pro features IP67 waterproofing and an IR blaster, while the Mate 10 gets a headphone jack and a microSD card slot in return.\nThe Mate 10 Pro gets an IR blaster; the Mate 10 gets a headphone jack\nBeyond external differences, both phones are similarly specced. They each feature a Kirin 970 CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 4,000mAh battery, 64GB of storage, and dual cameras with f/1.6 lenses. That camera setup includes a 20-megapixel color sensor and a secondary 12-megapixel monochrome sensor designed to gather additional luminance information and detail, as with the P10 and other recent Huawei flagships. The Pro has an additional variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the Porsche Design model comes with 6GB of RAM and ups the storage to 256GB. \nBoth phones use USB-C, as you\u2019d expect, and Huawei has developed a desktop docking solution that\u2019s similar in concept to Samsung\u2019s DeX, which in turn is similar in concept to Windows Continuum and the Motorola Atrix and a lot of other things that didn't work out. Huawei\u2019s spin doesn\u2019t require a dock, however \u2014 you can plug your phone directly into a monitor with a cable and expect to get around three hours of use in the desktop environment, which features resizable windows and Office support. The system allows you to use your phone as normal while it\u2019s powering the larger monitor, and there are privacy controls that allow you to stop notifications from popping up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\nBut the biggest differentiator for Huawei this year is the Kirin 970 chip, developed in-house at the company\u2019s HiSilicon semiconductor arm. The Kirin 970 includes what Huawei is calling an NPU, or neural processing unit, which is designed to handle tasks related to AI and deep learning. Apple announced much the same with the iPhone 8 and X\u2019s A11 Bionic chip, which includes a \u201cneural engine,\u201d but Huawei is leaning harder into making the Kirin 970\u2019s NPU a core feature of the device.\nHuawei says performance degradation is a big problem with Android, which it\u2019s trying to fix\nOne of the biggest claims is that Huawei\u2019s AI processing will be able to significantly reduce the phone\u2019s performance degradation over time, which the company has identified as a major problem with Android devices in general. The Mate 10 uses on-device processing to build a model of how you use the phone and allocates resources accordingly with machine learning predicting user behavior. And while Apple\u2019s lead in raw CPU processing speed is seemingly unassailable in the mobile space, Huawei believes it will be able to outstrip the new iPhones when it comes to on-device deep learning tasks such as image recognition. \nIt\u2019s hard to judge any of this without having the phone in hand \u2014 in fact, it\u2019ll be hard to judge much of it without having used the phone for several months. But it\u2019s clear that dedicated AI hardware is going to have its uses, and Huawei is demonstrating a significant advantage by managing to spin up its own take on the idea before the likes of Qualcomm.\nHuawei\u2019s last flagship, the P10, came with some disappointing quirks, and the company\u2019s claims about the Mate 10 require that we reserve judgement even further. On paper, though, Huawei\u2019s latest are intriguing devices that carry a lot of potential. \nHuawei has set European pricing at \u20ac699 ($824) for the Mate 10, \u20ac799 ($942) for the Mate 10 Pro, and a staggering yet unsurprising $1,395 ($1,645) for the Porsche Design Mate 10 Pro \u2014 the release date hasn\u2019t been announced yet, nor have any plans for a US launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
