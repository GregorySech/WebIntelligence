{"title": "Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s big summer update adds cooperative raids and redesigned gyms", "content": " \nNearly a year after it first launched, Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting a big summer update aimed at making the game both more accessible and more social. While it may not be as popular as the heady days when it first debuted, developer Niantic says that Pok\u00e9mon Go has been downloaded more than 750 million times to date, and it currently boasts 65 million monthly players. To keep that fanbase engaged, the studio is adding two major new features to the game, which you\u2019ll be able to experience shortly through a pair of free updates. The updates join a slew of changes for the game over the past year, which include everything from the addition of new creatures to the limited time in-game events.\nHere\u2019s what to expect this summer:\nMultiplayer raid battles\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know that scene in the original Pok\u00e9mon Go trailer where trainers team up to fight a huge, powerful pok\u00e9mon in Times Square? \u201cRaid battles\u201d are Niantic\u2019s attempt to bring that concept into the game. Essentially, the battles allow up to 20 players to work together to fight rare bosses, which will randomly appear at gyms. You\u2019ll know a boss is coming because a pok\u00e9mon egg will appear at a gym, complete with a timer to let you know when it will hatch. Once that happens, a powerful pocket monster will show up, and the group will have just five minutes to defeat it.\nIf you succeed, you\u2019ll then have a chance to capture the rare pok\u00e9mon \u2014 though, naturally, it\u2019ll be a bit tougher to snag than most monsters. There are also a handful of new items that can only be earned through raids, including rare candies (which turn into a pok\u00e9mon\u2019s candy when used on them), golden razz berries (which offer a greater chance of capturing wild pok\u00e9mon), and two types of technical machines that let you permanently teach a monster either a fast or charged attack.\nThe idea behind raids is to get players back outside and working together. Because the battles are centered around gyms, you\u2019ll need to be in the same areas as your teammates in order to take on a raid. And while the default raids are public, you can also create private battles limited to just you and friends. Niantic says one of the goals of raids is to allow all players \u2014 not just those who play every day and have a roster of strong pok\u00e9mon \u2014 to be able to access higher-level content. It\u2019s also a chance to capture strong monsters. Accessing raids will require a new item called a \u201craid pass.\u201d Players will get one free pass per day, and can purchase additional ones as well.\nThe raid battles are expected to launch as a free update \u201cin the weeks ahead.\u201d\nRedesigned gyms\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso coming soon are some fairly big changes to how gyms work. For one thing, gyms will now essentially double as pok\u00e9stops. You\u2019ll have the option to spin a disc at a gym and earn items like berries, pok\u00e9balls, and more. (Niantic says one of the motivations behind this change was to increase the number of pok\u00e9stops available in rural and suburban areas.)\nThe structure of gyms is also changing. Now they\u2019ll feature six permanent slots for pok\u00e9mon, and instead of being ordered based on strength, you\u2019ll be able to battle them in the order in which they were assigned to the gym. (Each of the six slots will also be occupied by a different type of pok\u00e9mon, so you won\u2019t find yourself fighting through six straight Dragonites.) The update will also introduce a new feature called motivation. Pok\u00e9mon who are part of a gym will lose motivation over time, which in turn will lower their CP, making them easier to defeat. In order to keep the motivation up, players from the same team can visit a gym and feed the pok\u00e9mon berries to increase the stat.\nNiantic says the new gyms will be available to all players \u201csoon.\u201d But until that happens, the company is temporarily disabling gyms in the game. \u201cOnce the update has been rolled out to players around the world, gyms will return,\u201d the developer says.\n"}
