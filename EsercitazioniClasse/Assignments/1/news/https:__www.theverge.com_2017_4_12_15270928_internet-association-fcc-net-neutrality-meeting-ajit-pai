{"title": "Google, Facebook, Netflix lobbyist tells the FCC not to destroy net neutrality", "content": " \nA group representing today\u2019s biggest web companies met with FCC leader Ajit Pai on Tuesday and offered a defense of net neutrality, which increasingly appears to be under threat.\nThe Internet Association, which represents more than three dozen companies including Google, Facebook, and Netflix, told Pai that it maintains \u201cvigorous support\u201d for the 2015 net neutrality order and said that the \u201cexisting net neutrality rules should be enforced and kept intact,\u201d according to a filing made by the group.\nPai\u2019s plan to undo net neutrality is supposedly coming soon\nThe meeting comes just a week after Pai is said to have privately revealed plans to drop the existing net neutrality rules and instead encourage net neutrality principles to be established in customer service agreements \u2014 a dramatically weaker way of maintaining net neutrality, if it can even be said to really do that, than what\u2019s currently in effect.\nPai\u2019s meeting with the Internet Association has been on the books for months, so the timing here is somewhat coincidental. But it offered web companies the chance to restate their support for strong net neutrality rules, suggesting that Pai is in for a fight if he tries to weaken them.\nThe Internet Association said that there are four key net neutrality principles it wants to see maintained no matter what: no paid fast lanes, no unreasonable interconnect fees, rules that apply to both wireless and wired internet, and having the FCC be capable of enforcing the rules.\nThough the group expressed full support for net neutrality\u2019s current implementation,  it doesn\u2019t strictly demand the use of Title II to put internet providers under a strong regulatory regime. Instead, the Internet Association says that what matters is \u201cthe end result \u2014 meaningful net neutrality rules that withstand the test of time.\u201d\nThe Internet Association also showed some amount of support for the recently struck-down internet privacy rules, saying that the FCC was correct to find a distinction between web companies like Google and Facebook and internet providers like Comcast and AT&T. Republicans and Pai himself have insisted that this distinction doesn\u2019t exist, and thanks to Congress, it looks like it won\u2019t be present whenever new privacy rules are put in place.\nIf Pai offered more details of his plan to undo the 2015 net neutrality order, the Internet Association didn\u2019t mention it. Pai is said to have first brought it up during a meeting with internet providers last week. None of the details are public yet, but The Wall Street Journal says they could come as soon as next month.\n"}
