{"title": "HBO Go finally adds an automated binge mode to its iOS and Android apps", "content": " \nHBO Go is still one of the best ways to watch HBO content if you (or a family member) happen to have a cable subscription. Unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t ever been the best app to navigate, forcing you to dig through its library just to get to the next episode of Game of Thrones. Thankfully, that\u2019s changing today. With the latest update, the app finally makes it easier to pick up where you last left off or keep watching your favorite show without needing to touch your smartphone.\nWhat users have come to expect from Netflix and Hulu\nHBO Go\u2019s new continuous binge mode is essentially what users have grown to expect from Netflix and Hulu. After finding the show you want to watch, the app will surface you the next episode you need to see, or prompt you to pick back up on the episode you paused earlier. And after the credits roll, the next episode will play automatically.\nHBO Go has slowly improved over the years, making it a reasonable alternative for those not still unwilling to paying the $15 per month for HBO Now. However, it still needs some work in the UI department. With all that in mind, this one little addition is more than welcome.\n\n"}
