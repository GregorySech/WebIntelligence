{"title": "Samsung\u2019s browser comes to all Android phones and gets an ad-tracking blocker", "content": " \nSamsung\u2019s web browser is now available on all Android phones running Android 5.0 and above. In the same update, Samsung Internet is also getting a built-in ad-tracking blocker. Users on other Android devices can find the Samsung Internet app in the Play Store or Galaxy Apps store. Previously, Samsung Internet was only available on Samsung devices and Google\u2019s Nexus and Pixel devices.\nThe browser\u2019s new extension blocks invisible trackers, allowing you to browse privately. You can toggle on the tracking blocker, or if you\u2019re in Secret Mode, the blocker will already be enabled by default. The extension is powered by Disconnect, a privacy protection company, which already makes a similar ad-blocking extension for Samsung Internet. \nWith the new blocker, Samsung might have taken a cue from its competitors. Apple recently began restricting ad tracking on the mobile and desktop versions of Safari last month.\nIn this newest version, Samsung also announced the browser was getting a Night Mode and a High Contrast mode, for browsing with white text on a black background, to reduce eye strain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
