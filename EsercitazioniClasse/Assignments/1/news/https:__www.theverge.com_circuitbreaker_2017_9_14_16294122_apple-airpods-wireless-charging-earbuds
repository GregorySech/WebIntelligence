{"title": "Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods charging case is reportedly coming in December for $69", "content": " \nApple spoke very briefly about AirPods at Tuesday\u2019s big iPhone X event, and only really mentioned that the truly wireless earbuds would, like the new phones, be capable of wireless charging using a new case. Now, MacRumors is reporting via Macprime that the refreshed case with Qi wireless charging could come later this year at a price of $69.\nAs MacRumors points out, that\u2019s the same price as a replacement for the current case if the owner is out of warranty. Otherwise, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s still unknown about how Apple will make this switch. Will the company simply add the new case to its inventory and sell it alongside the original $159 AirPods at the same price or with a slight markup? Will Apple allow AirPod owners to upgrade to the new case, and will there be a charge associated with that?  \nWhatever the case, when Apple debuted AirPods a year ago, the narrative around the product was the same as the removal of the headphone jack: \u201cthe future is wireless.\u201d AirPods\u2019 relative absence from this week\u2019s event makes it seem like Apple is completely content with the first draft of that future. So if, like me, you weren\u2019t a fan of AirPods\u2019 open design, the way they fit, or the earbuds\u2019 long stalks, don\u2019t be surprised if you have to wait another year for a revision.\n \n"}
