{"title": "Rap songs about Donnie Darko, ranked", "content": " \nRichard Kelly\u2019s 2001 cult classic Donnie Darko is returning to theaters this weekend in 4K, in honor of the film\u2019s 15th anniversary. If you weren\u2019t already aware of that fact, I\u2019m so pleased to be able to bring you a pleasant Monday afternoon surprise. \nAs one of the top 10 Donnie Darko fans anywhere (but not in a scary way), I\u2019ve been preparing for the event by trawling Reddit for photos of super hideous Donnie Darko tattoos, reading articles I don\u2019t totally understand about its one-of-a-kind cinematography, and listening to rap songs that reference Donnie Darko either obliquely or outright. There are, I am thrilled to tell you, literally dozens of these (there\u2019s also a rapper named Donnie Darko, but he doesn\u2019t rap about the movie), and I\u2019m going to rank 10 of them for you right here, right now. You\u2019re welcome, and how do I put this on a CD? \n10. \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by G. Wiz\n\n\u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by G. Wiz starts with the phrase \u201cit was all a dream,\u201d which is not at all a correct interpretation of the sci-fi film Donnie Darko \u2014 a rough start. \nThis song also has a rough middle and ending, musically, but I enjoy many of the visuals (including the subtle reference of wearing a white long-sleeve T-shirt while biking). One of the comments on \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by G. Wiz is \u201ccompletely and in all ways unrelated to the movie,\u201d which I don\u2019t think is totally fair because G. Wiz does say \u201cthe world looks like it\u2019s ending soon.\u201d Donnie Darko is, in most interpretations, about narrowly avoiding the end of the world. Also, someone dressed up exactly like Frank the Bunny from Donnie Darko for this music video and many scenes take place in front of a bathroom mirror. So, in some ways it\u2019s related, for sure. Nice. \n9. \u201cbamfomania next\u201d by bamfomania\n\nThe video for \u201cbamfomania next\u201d is also about the world ending, and about a bunny (presumably Frank, though the costuming is too vague to say for sure) looming over the protagonist\u2019s shoulder. At one part one of the guys said \u201cI had a beard at birth,\u201d which isn\u2019t true about Jake Gyllenhaal, but he does have one now.  \nIt\u2019s not great, but the effort is there, which is why it is ranked 9th. I am a huge fan of effort and Donnie Darko, though not a huge fan of this song. \n8. \u201cMad World (Remix)\u201d by Lowkey and Doc Brown \n\nThis is a remix of Gary Jules\u2019 \u201cMad World,\u201d a song made famous by the final scene of Donnie Darko. It\u2019s performed by British rapper Doc Brown, who also has a starring role on Law & Order: UK. There is a lyric in \u201cMad World (Remix)\u201d about being \u201ctrapped in the system of capitalism,\u201d which I assume is a reference to the anti-Reagan politics of the film Donnie Darko and its fairly cynical portrayal of American suburbs in the late 1980s. \nThis song is also called \u201cDonnie\u2019s Lament,\u201d which is nice. Donnie lamented a lot of things in the film Donnie Darko, because he was a teenager living in a... mad world. There is a lyric about \u201csuffering from sleep deprivation,\u201d which is sort of related to one of Donnie\u2019s main problems: sleepwalking to Patrick Swayze\u2019s house. \n7. \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by Richard Weirdo\n\nThe song \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by Richard Weirdo contains a very literal Donnie Darko reference, which I\u2019ll repeat here verbatim: \u201cFeeling like I\u2019m Donnie Darko / trapped in a room with all my sorrows / everywhere these voices follow / don\u2019t know if I see tomorrow.\u201d At the end, someone asks, \u201cWhy are you wearing that stupid man suit?\u201d This is one of the film Donnie Darko\u2019s most famous lines.\nTexas rapper Richard Weirdo is part of a crew called RichBrokeDudez, and they all went to high school together. That\u2019s nice, though friendship is not thematically relevant to the film Donnie Darko, which is about emotional isolation. \n6. \u201cBunny Boy, Can I Be Frank?\u201d by Fresh Out The Shower \n\nI love the idea of rapping immediately after getting out of the shower, both because the shower is a notorious \u201cbest creative thinking\u201d zone and because being fresh out of the shower is just a pleasant frame of mind to be in, generally. Also, this teenage girl using maybe the most famous teenage boy movie of the last 50 years for her own adolescent angst is inspiring to me. \nThere are few obvious Donnie Darko references in this song (mostly the word \u201cbunny\u201d and the word \u201cmask\u201d a few times each). However, the whole tune is about not feeling that bad RE: being a high school misfit. Donnie Darko, too, does not feel that bad about being a misfit \u2014 he has no shame and openly talks about time travel with anyone who will listen. Perfect.\n5. \u201cdarko\u201d by ISLAND LOOT\n\nISLAND LOOT is not a producer I\u2019ve heard of before, but their SoundCloud profile image is of James Franco\u2019s character in Spring Breakers. That\u2019s kind of alarming. So is this song, which is mostly just an ominous beat with bits of Jake Gyllenhaal laughing or saying \u201cI made a new friend. He talks to me about time travel\u201d layered on top. \nOne of the comments on the song is \u201cR.I.P. donnie,\u201d to which ISLAND LOOT responded \u201cin memoriam\u201d \u2014 confirming that this song is in tribute to Donnie Darko of Donnie Darko. It\u2019s not really a rap song, but it\u2019s short and I genuinely like it, and I think it would be easy to slip into a SoundCloud playlist without majorly inconveniencing yourself. Then you would get to listen to Jake Gyllenhaal laugh once in a while. That might be nice?\n4. \u201cMount Sinai\u201d by $UICIDEBOY$\n\nNew Orleans duo $UICIDEBOY$ are known for surreal, scary \u201chorrorcore\u201d rap, which makes it very close to too-on-the-nose for them to rap about Donnie Darko. They did so in the song \u201cMount Sinai\u201d anyway, saying \u201cI'm Donnie Darko when I spark up and I'm creeping like Frank.\u201d Frank is pretty creepy, and Donnie Darko does smoke one cigarette in Donnie Darko. While he\u2019s smoking it, one of his friends makes a comment like \u201cthat\u2019s some good shit, huh?\u201d and then Donnie says \u201c... it\u2019s a cigarette.\u201d \nHe, like $UICIDEBOY$, would probably say that he\u2019d \u201crather be left alone.\u201d This song ranks higher than it might otherwise because one of the $UICIDEBOY$ uses \u201cYung Heath Ledger\u201d as one of his many aliases, and Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were dear friends.\n3. \u201cThe Last Temptation\u201d by Ja Rule ft. Charli Baltimore \n\nThis Ja Rule song (and the album it appears on), is possibly named after Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ \u2014 a notorious culture war flashpoint that serves as a pivotal plot point in Donnie Darko and provides the backbone for one of the most popular fan theories about the film. \nI can\u2019t prove that Ja Rule intended this song to be a reference to Donnie Darko, but it was released in the fall of 2002, almost exactly one year after Donnie Darko premiered in theaters and flopped abysmally. The song is about partying and car rides and living it up before you die, several things that happen in the film Donnie Darko just after Donnie goes to see the film The Last Temptation of Christ and just before the film ends violently. \n3. \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by BLEEZIEDUB7\n\nThis rapper, who also goes by Blaz\u00e9, has a pretty good Twitter account and writes great Donnie Darko-inspired lyrics! \nI am very into the line \u201cI\u2019m human / I\u2019m gruesome / no doubt about it / I\u2019m Donnie Darko\u2019s little buddy.\u201d The song \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d is about struggling to articulate a creeping feeling of malaise and dread, as well as a few quibbles with religion and some questions about whether laws of physics are real. The film Donnie Darko is also about all of those things, which makes this both the most literally relevant and most thematically relevant Donnie Darko rap track I have been able to find.  \n1. \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d by Mackned ft. SneakGuapo \n\nThe best Jake Gyllenhaal reference in \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d goes \u201cthe world move slow so I stay inside a bubble.\u201d \nThe best Donnie Darko reference in \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d is the title, and otherwise it\u2019s not clear if anyone singing has seen the movie Donnie Darko. However the song is interspersed with snippets of dialogue from one of my favorite scenes in Donnie Darko, a dinner table argument about curse words and Michael Dukakis. This is a very chill, hypnotic rap song about falling asleep after drinking \u201ckombucha and lean,\u201d in tandem with \u201cvicodin and syrup\u201d and it ends with Jake Gyllenhaal saying \u201cHow exactly does one suck a fuck?\u201d backed by a twinkly angel choir.\nIt\u2019s beautiful. \nBonus: \u201cMad World (rap remix)\u201d by Gary Jules ft. The Game\n\nThis mash-up of \u201cMad World\u201d and The Game\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Ok (One Blood)\u201d is probably illegal, but that can\u2019t stop you from listening to it for now. I don\u2019t know at all what the lyrics of this The Game song have to do with Donnie Darko, as they\u2019re mostly about blood and rappers who The Game doesn\u2019t like very much, but it all sounds okay. The underlying beat is fine, so you could jog to it \u2014 all the way to your local theater for a showing of Donnie Darko.\nSee you at the movies!\n\n"}
