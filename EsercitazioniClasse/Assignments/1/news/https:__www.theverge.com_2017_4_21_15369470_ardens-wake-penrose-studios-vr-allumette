{"title": "Arden\u2019s Wake is a coming-of-age story set in an underwater future Manhattan", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special-event releases. We\u2019re currently reporting from the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.\nTwo-year-old virtual reality studio Penrose has developed a remarkably distinctive aesthetic in its short life. Its first two pieces, loosely adapted from The Little Prince and Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s \"The Little Match Girl,\" established a diorama-like visual style that made animated characters look real enough to touch, with self-contained environments that floated in mid-air.\nPenrose\u2019s third work, Arden\u2019s Wake, is an interesting expansion on this formula. It\u2019s the first piece to not be obviously based on a well-known children\u2019s story, and the first set in a world that envelops viewers instead of floating in the air \u2014\u00a0in this case, a massive future ocean. There\u2019s no set length yet, but the 15-minute prologue debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival, and it\u2019s now making its way out to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nPost-apocalyptic monomyth.\nWhat\u2019s it about?\nA young woman named Mina and her father live an isolated, ocean-bound life in a distant future. They\u2019re haunted by the memory of Arden, Mina\u2019s mother,\u00a0who drowned in an event that\u2019s only hinted at in the prologue. Then, on an underwater scavenging trip, Mina\u2019s father disappears. When she goes to rescue him, we learn that their small cabin is built on top of an underwater future Manhattan, and that a fantastical creature is living in its ruins.\nOkay, what\u2019s it really about?\nPenrose co-founder Eugene Chung describes Arden\u2019s Wake as a coming-of-age story that mirrors the studio\u2019s last piece, Allumette \u2014 although Arden\u2019s Wake doesn\u2019t seem as overtly tragic. But as with so much virtual reality art, it\u2019s still primarily an exercise in how to create stories for the medium.\nIs it good?\nWith only the first part available, it\u2019s difficult to judge what the final piece might look like, especially because the prologue ends on a cliffhanger. But Arden\u2019s Wake is one of the rare VR films with a premise that could hold up in an older, more sophisticated medium. It feels a little like Scott Synder and Sean Murphy\u2019s comic The Wake, though the titles are unconnected and tonally different \u2014 both involve a young woman navigating a flooded world with semi-mythological elements.\nEach part of a scene is like a comic panel\nEven so, the most interesting thing about Arden\u2019s Wake is its diorama structure. The piece is a simple but effective example of spatial storytelling. You\u2019re given a god\u2019s-eye view of an environment, but each piece of it is like an individual comic panel. The set is small enough that you\u2019re not missing out on pieces of the story, but the setup makes you feel like you\u2019re actively following the plot, playing the role of the camera.\nIn one scene, for example, you might look outside the house to see a young man serenading Mina with a guitar. Then, you peer up and around to see Mina watching him from a window. The father is hammering away at a wooden bathysphere on the other side of the house, but then he notices what\u2019s going on, and you can follow him across the living room, where he throws a bucket of fish at the suitor.\nAt some point, you might also sneak a glance below the water, where you can see a slender wooden stalk holding the cabin up \u2014 a hint that there\u2019s something dark and strange lurking below the lighthearted antics on the surface. Penrose could do a lot more with this idea, but Arden\u2019s Wake still takes it further than Allumette, which introduced the mechanic.\nWhat should it be rated?\nA light PG for its intense and eerie underwater sequences, because the sea is terrifying.\nHow can I actually watch it?\nThe Arden\u2019s Wake prologue will be available soon on a variety of VR platforms.\n"}
