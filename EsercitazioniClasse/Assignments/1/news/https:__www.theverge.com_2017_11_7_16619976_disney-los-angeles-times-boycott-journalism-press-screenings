{"title": "Disney ends ban on Los Angeles Times after media backlash", "content": " \nAfter growing media pressure, Disney lifted its media blackout of the Los Angeles Times, which had barred movie critics at the publication from attending press screenings of its movies. Disney originally blacklisted the newspaper after it published an investigation of the entertainment giant\u2019s business ties to the city of Anaheim, which Disney called \u201cunfair.\u201d \nIn response, writers, film critic associations, and publications like The A.V. Club, the National Society of Film Critics, and most recently, The New York Times, stepped up in solidarity with the Los Angeles Times, announcing that they would boycott advance screenings of Disney Films. A.A. Dowd wrote for The A.V. Club, \u201cNow more than ever, journalists need to be united in combating these kinds of attacks.\u201d\n\n\nDisney's boycott of the LA Times is unprofessional and unjournalistic. It's petty, vindictive, and it makes the company look small.\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 6, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Wire creator David Simon, once a journalist himself, posted on Twitter that he would refuse to vote for a Disney film during awards season, and director Ava DuVernay also told journalists she was \u201cstanding with [them].\u201d\nAs pressure continued to build, Disney decided to reverse the ban this afternoon, only four days after it was announced. In a statement to The Verge, Disney cited \u201cproductive discussions with the newly installed leadership at The Los Angeles Times\u201d as the reason. Alyssa Rosenberg, The Washington Post critic who led the call for solidarity, called the decision \u201ca huge victory\u201d for critics.\nUpdate November 7th, 6:36PM ET: This article was corrected to reflect that one Washington Post critic announced she was boycotting Disney films \u2014 not the whole publication.\n"}
