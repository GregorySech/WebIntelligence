{"title": "FCC announces plan to reverse Title II net neutrality", "content": " \nThe Federal Communications Commission is cracking open the net neutrality debate again with a proposal to undo the 2015 rules that implemented net neutrality with Title II classification.\nFCC chairman Ajit Pai called the rules \u201cheavy handed\u201d and said their implementation was \u201call about politics.\u201d He argued that they hurt investment and said that small internet providers don\u2019t have \u201cthe means or the margins\u201d to withstand the regulatory onslaught.\n\u201cEarlier today I shared with my fellow commissioners a proposal to reverse the mistake of Title II and return to the light touch framework that served us so well during the Clinton administration, Bush administration, and first six years of the Obama administration,\u201d Pai said today.\nThe full net neutrality proposal will be revealed Thursday\nHis proposal will do three things: first, it\u2019ll reclassify internet providers as Title I information services; second, it\u2019ll prevent the FCC from adapting any net neutrality rules to practices that internet providers haven\u2019t thought up yet; and third, it\u2019ll open questions about what to do with several key net neutrality rules \u2014 like no blocking or throttling of apps and websites \u2014 that were implemented in 2015.\nPai said the full text of his net neutrality proposal would be published tomorrow afternoon. It\u2019ll be voted on by the FCC at a meeting on May 18th. From there, months of debate will follow as the item is opened up for public comment. The commission will then revise its rules based on the feedback it receives before taking a final vote to enact them.\nStrong net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 and have been in place for about two years. Those rules reclassified internet providers as \u201ccommon carriers\u201d under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which subject them to tough, utility-style regulation.\nWhile the commission didn\u2019t apply many of the traditional utility restrictions \u2014 like pricing regulations \u2014 the classification was meant to ensure that internet providers would be subject to careful oversight.\nRepublicans argue the 2015 net neutrality rules harmed investment and innovation\nThe commission mandated that internet providers follow a few key rules: no blocking of sites and apps, no throttling the speed of sites and apps, and no paid fast lanes. The rules applied to both wired and wireless internet providers and also gave the commission oversight of \u201cinterconnect\u201d agreements between internet providers and big content companies like Netflix.\nInternet providers have, of course, been unhappy about this, as they\u2019d rather not have the FCC looking over their shoulder and limiting what they\u2019re able to do with their network. They sued to overturn the rules, but so far the rules have been held up in court.\nRepublicans have also been unhappy with the rules, and it\u2019s been clear since Trump was elected that they\u2019d take a shot at reversing them. They view the existing net neutrality  rules as heavy handed and believe they limit innovation from internet providers.\nOne issue they\u2019ve pointed to in particular is investment in broadband networks. There was a slight dip in investment the year net neutrality rules were passed, and Republicans have pointed to that as evidence that these are damaging policies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.\u201d\nDuring his speech today, Pai claimed Title II classification hurt \u201clow-income, rural, and urban neighborhoods\u201d the most and had the effect of \u201caccelerating the practice of digital redlining,\u201d because these neighborhoods would be the first areas cut when internet providers cut back their spending. \nWhile network investment is an important metric for the FCC to track \u2014 it\u2019s responsible for improving access to broadband \u2014 it\u2019s hardly the only metric to track how much impact the rules have had. At the end of the day, internet providers are still doing well and have seen their stock prices rise, which suggest investors aren\u2019t as devastated by net neutrality as they let on.\nThe argument for net neutrality is that the limitations put on internet providers are worth the tradeoff for keeping the internet open. If internet providers have the ability to control or influence which websites you visit, that\u2019ll hugely tip the scales in favor of their own services and the services of existing juggernauts that can pay for access. Netflix, for instance, may have struggled if it had to pay internet providers for fast streaming.\nRepublicans and internet providers continue to argue that they aren\u2019t actually against net neutrality, they\u2019re just against the Title II classification. While it\u2019s possible to have net neutrality without Title II \u2014 common carrier rules are just a way to go about implementing them \u2014 the argument gets a lot less convincing when you actually look at what they\u2019re proposing as an alternative.\nTheir alternative seems to be net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t backed up by close regulatory oversight. That means internet providers have a lot more leeway to skirt the rules.\nAdvocates and web companies are already coming out in opposition \nIn his final speech as FCC chairman, Tom Wheeler, who oversaw the passing of the 2015 rules, laid out a basic test by which he said we could tell if a net neutrality proposal offered true net neutrality. A proposal had to offer three things, he said: an agency with full authority to protect consumers, rules that can evolve to fit new devices and networks, and consistent guidelines that make it clear what behavior is and isn\u2019t appropriate.\n\u201cPassing legislation or adopting regulations without these key provisions and calling it net neutrality would be false advertising,\u201d Wheeler said at the time.\nDemocrats, activists, and web companies are already coming out in opposition to Pai\u2019s plans. Senator Bill Nelson, ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a statement that \u201cdepriving the FCC of its ongoing, forward-looking oversight of the broadband industry amounts to a dereliction of duty at a time when guaranteeing an open internet is more critical than ever.\u201d\nThe Internet Association, a group that represents more than 40 top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, and Netflix, said there was no reason to change the rules. \u201cThe current FCC net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d said the group\u2019s CEO, Michael Beckerman. \u201cConsumers pay for access to the entire internet free from blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization.\u201d\nA group of 800 startups and investors, led by Y Combinator, also released a letter this morning directed to Pai, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework.\u201d While the ACLU and 170 other advocacy groups wrote Pai last month asking for him to preserve the 2015 rules.\nPai is well aware that he\u2019s in for a fight, but it\u2019s one he thinks is worth starting. \u201cMake no mistake about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fight that we intend to wage, and this is a fight that we are going to win.\u201d\n"}
