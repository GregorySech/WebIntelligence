Now, the company has responded to concerns, and says that it will scale back its collection efforts.While many device makers routinely collect some information on how users are using their devices, one security researcher was alarmed at the amount that OnePlus devices were gathering up. He found that the phones collected \u201cIMEI s , phone numbers, MAC addresses, mobile network s  names and IMSI prefixes,\u201d as well as wireless network identifying numbers, his phone\u2019s serial number, and data on what apps were being used and when.In the forum post, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei explained that the company\u2019s devices using OxygenOS \u201csecurely transmit analytics in two different streams, usage analytics and device information.\u201d Pei wrote that the company collected this information to improve the phone\u2019s operating system, and that users have the option of opting out of the user experience program that collects the data. In response to the concerns, he noted that the company will begin improving the program going forward, and added that the collected data wasn\u2019t shared outside of the company. Those improvements will mean that users using OxygenOS-equipped phones will be prompted to opt into the program at the end of October, and that the terms of service will be updated accordingly. Pei also says that the company will stop collecting phone numbers, MAC Addresses and WiFi information.  "}
