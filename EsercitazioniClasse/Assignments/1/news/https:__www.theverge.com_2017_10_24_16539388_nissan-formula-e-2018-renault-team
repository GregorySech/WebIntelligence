{"title": "Nissan is joining EV racing series Formula E next year", "content": " Nissan is joining Formula E, the first global racing series made up of all-electric racecars. The Japanese car manufacturer announced today at the Tokyo Motor Show that it will enter the series late next year at the start of Formula E\u2019s fifth season. It will be the first manufacturer from Japan to compete in the young racing series, joining other carmakers from Germany  Audi, BMW, and \u2014 soon \u2014 Porsche and Mercedes-Benz , China  NIO , France  DS , the United Kingdom  Jaguar , and others. The move will likely come at the expense of Renault, according to a recent report from Motorsport.com, as Nissan has decades-old strategic partnership with the French automaker. Representatives for Nissan declined to comment on Renault\u2019s plans, and a representative for Renault\u2019s racing division did not reply in time for publication. Nissan \u201cwill work with its partner Renault to leverage expertise and development already available, in keeping with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi automotive partnership\u2019s focus on collaboration and maximizing synergies to boost competitiveness,\u201d the company wrote in a statement. Further details will be announced closer to the start of season five.  The beginning of season four is just over one month away, and the teams and manufacturers are already locked in.  It would be a seismic shift in the sport if Nissan replaces RenaultIt would be a seismic shift if Nissan\u2019s entry pushes Renault out of the sport, as the French automaker has won both team championships since Formula E began allowing manufacturers to compete in 2016. And e.Dams \u2014 the team that runs Renault\u2019s race operations in Formula E \u2014 won the championship in the first season. It\u2019s expected that e.Dams would remain with Nissan, according to Motorsport.com, putting the Japanese manufacturer in an excellent position as it enters Formula E. It was only started in 2014, but major manufacturers have been flocking to Formula E, and for a number of reasons. It\u2019s a relatively low financial commitment as far as motorsports go, and so involvement Formula E is seen as a low-risk way to promote a company\u2019s EV efforts to a new, younger audience. Companies like Audi and Porsche, which have both been implicated in diesel emissions scandals, even quit or reduced their presence in more expensive  and more traditional  motorsports series in order to make the switch. .@Nissan is joining the @FIAformulaE championship.

The series only allows the manufacturers to develop a limited amount of the tech that powers the cars, but the series plans to expand what carmakers can tinker with as the seasons go by, increasing the technological relevance to their road cars. Nissan already competes in a variety of motorsports via its performance arm, Nismo, though its flirtations with hybrid electric racecars have produced unflattering results. But, considering Nissan\u2019s history with EVs, the fact that it\u2019s about to start heavily promoting the new 2018 Leaf, and its ambitious electric plans for the future, Formula E seems like the right place to be.
