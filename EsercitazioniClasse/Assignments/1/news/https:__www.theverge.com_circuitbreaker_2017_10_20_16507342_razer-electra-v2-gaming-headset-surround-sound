{"title": "Razer\u2019s Electra V2 headset does virtual 7.1 surround sound on a budget", "content": " \nGaming headphones and headsets can be a real crapshoot, with some of them being downright excellent and others, the majority, tending toward poorly engineered disappointment. I can\u2019t yet speak for where on that spectrum Razer\u2019s Electra V2 cans will land, but the good thing is that you won\u2019t be making much of a financial gamble to find out.\nThe newly updated Electra V2 sport Razer\u2019s signature luminous green as an accent color and a nice aluminum headband with a self-adjusting fit. They cost $59.99 with a standard 3.5mm analog connector or $69.99 with a USB plug, and both versions offer the promise of 7.1 virtual surround sound.\nFaux leather ear pads sit in front of 40mm drivers that Razer says it has custom-tuned to suit the needs of gamers. That sounds a little peculiar at first, when you think that every headphone seller should be custom-tuning its own hardware, but many companies like Razer tend to buy components off the shelf and create branded enclosures and exterior design to go with them. Razer seems to have taken an extra step here, even if it\u2019s small one.\nThe Electra V2 are available from the Razerzone online store right away.\n"}
