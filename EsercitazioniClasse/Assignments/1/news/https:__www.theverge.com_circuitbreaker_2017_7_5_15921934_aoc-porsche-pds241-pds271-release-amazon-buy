{"title": "AOC and Porsche designed a monitor with no hanging cables", "content": " \nAOC and Studio F. A. Porsche are collaborating on monitors. The companies designed and manufactured two new Full HD displays \u2014 the 24-inch PDS241 and the 27-inch PDS271 \u2014 with their single cable as the selling point. That cable, which is routed through the stand and comes out the back, combines the power and HDMI inputs in one place. I suppose a single cable looks better than a bunch of them hanging off the display, but is this necessarily the pinnacle of design? Nah, probably not.\nAOC and Porsche get worked up about their design work in a press release. Here\u2019s a sample of what it says: \nThe design philosophy behind these monitors was inspired by the principals of Ferdinand Alexander Porsche: His approach was \u201cIf you analyze the function of an object, its form often becomes obvious.\u201d In its purest sense, a monitor is just a screen. But the screen is meant to provide a beautiful visual experience, and that experience is often marred by unsightly cables hanging down from the monitor\u2019s ports.\nDeep. Porsche didn\u2019t seem to take branding into account when ruminating on design. Doesn\u2019t AOC realize that stamping its name across the front and back ruins any impressive look? AOC isn\u2019t Apple or Rolls-Royce or even Porsche; its branding doesn\u2019t exude cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: AOS\n\n\nIn either case, the 24-inch version costs $199, while the 27-inch model costs $249. Both are available through Amazon, although their listings currently say \u201ctemporarily out of stock.\u201d They were already released in the UK, so I\u2019m sure this release is just delayed and they\u2019ll be stocked soon.\n"}
