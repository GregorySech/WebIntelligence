{"title": "Japan\u2019s Pikachu train is like a tiny speeding amusement park", "content": " \nPok\u00e9mon with You \u2014 which started as a disaster relief project after the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan \u2014 took over Japan Railway East in 2012 with a pok\u00e9mon-themed sightseeing train. Inside and out, it was decorated with characters and knickknacks from the series in extreme detail: fake plants, little tunnels, curtains, and decals. Starting July 15th, the train is getting a Pikachu-themed makeover. \nThe train, spotted by RocketNews24, has been reimagined with Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s most lovable electric mascot. Roughly translated to interior design, this equals a lot of yellow and brown. There\u2019s also a special play area filled with large Pikas for kids to befriend. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those hoping to ride the train, it runs on the Ofunato Line, which departs from Ichinoseki Station and ends at Kesennuma Station. The schedule is as follows, with tickets going on sale in advance: \n\nJuly 15th\u201317th, 22nd\u201323rd, 29th\u201331st\nAugust 1st\u201320th, 26th\u201327th\nSeptember 2nd\u20133rd, 9th\u201310th, 16th\u201318th, 23rd\u201324th, 30th\n\nNo word yet on when we\u2019ll get that Magikarp train. \n"}
