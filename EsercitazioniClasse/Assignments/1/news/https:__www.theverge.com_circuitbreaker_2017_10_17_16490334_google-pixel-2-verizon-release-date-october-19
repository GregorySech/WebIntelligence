{"title": "Google Pixel 2 will be available at Verizon stores on Thursday", "content": " \nIt\u2019s officially launch week for the Pixel 2. Some customers are set to receive their preorders as early as tomorrow, and Verizon \u2014 the exclusive carrier of Google\u2019s new smartphones \u2014 will have them for sale in stores on Thursday. \nA Verizon spokesperson confirmed that both the Pixel 2 and 2 XL will be available, though stock will vary by location. The spokesperson was unable to provide specifics on inventory. \nHopefully both Google and Verizon are better prepared to meet demand now than they were for the original Pixel last year, when it was impossible to find the device in stock for weeks. Verizon had a product on its shelves that it could only help you web order. If you want to avoid that nightmare, it might be worth getting to your local store bright and early. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nGoogle Pixel 2 review: plainly great\n\nThe Pixel 2 costs $649.99 (64GB) or $749.99 (128GB), and your color choices are white, black, or kinda blue. The 2 XL is $849.99 (64GB) or $949.99 (128GB) and comes in either black or the black/white mix that has seemingly been dubbed \u201cpanda.\u201d The regular Pixel 2 is still available for Thursday delivery if you prefer buying online, but the Pixel 2 XL is at backordered by at least a week or two. \nVerizon did a great job staying out of the way when it came to software updates on the original Pixel, which were almost always released simultaneously for both the unlocked and carrier models. There\u2019s no reason to believe the same won\u2019t hold true for the Pixel 2. (It\u2019s also likely that the bootloader on the Verizon Pixel 2 will remain locked, if you\u2019re the nerdy type who cares about that.) \nVerizon has had demo units of both new Google phones at stores ahead of their release. So if you\u2019re curious about the differences between those displays, you\u2019ve still got time to go and spend a few minutes with both devices before making a final choice. \nIf you\u2019re in New York City or Los Angeles, Google will also be selling the Pixels directly at its pop-up locations in those cities. \n"}
