{"title": "iFixit\u2019s new Retina MacBook Pro repair kit lets you change your old battery", "content": " \nIf you own one of Apple\u2019s Retina MacBook Pros (from 2012\u20132015, which is the model before the newest, Touch Bar-equipped iteration), then you know that they\u2019re not exactly meant to be taken apart once you\u2019ve bought one. Most parts are attached directly to the logic board, and the battery is particularly hostile to user replacement. The entire unit is physically glued in place with some industrial adhesive.\nStill, the good folks over at iFixit believe that everyone should be able to repair, replace, and upgrade the gadgets that they own, and they\u2019ve spent some serious time and effort coming up with a way to allow Retina MacBook Pro users to replace their batteries, allowing them to dramatically extend the usable lifespan of their laptops. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end result is the company\u2019s new Battery Replacement Kits for 2012\u20132015 Retina MacBook Pros, which cost between $89.95 to $109.95, depending on your particular model. The kit comes with all the parts and instructions you\u2019ll need to resurrect your aging MacBook Pro. \nThe catch is that the process of actually replacing the battery isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call simple. The location of the battery makes heating up the glue to weaken it unfeasible. (Remember: fire + batteries = bad.) So iFixit had to take a slightly more ridiculous-looking approach: it developed a chemical solvent that can dissolve Apple\u2019s adhesive so you can remove the old battery successfully. It\u2019s an impressive workaround. As iFixit notes, even Apple doesn\u2019t remove the entire battery for in-house repairs, instead the company just replaces the whole piece of the case that the battery is attached to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 37: Inject the acetone solvent underneath your MacBook Pro\u2019s battery to dissolve the adhesive glue...\nPhoto: iFixit\n\n\nEven with the kit and iFixit\u2019s detailed instructions, battery replacement isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. But if your MacBook Pro\u2019s battery has been giving you issues and you don\u2019t mind the extra effort, then grab your screwdriver, plastic pry bar, and your trusty syringe and get to work. \n"}
