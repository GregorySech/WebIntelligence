It\u2019s believed to depict Pharaoh Ramses II, one of Egypt\u2019s greatest rulers. \nThe statue, carved out of a tough rock known as quartzite, was submerged in groundwater where it was buried under the streets of a Cairo suburb. Archaeologists also recovered fragments of another statue believed to be of Ramses II\u2019s grandson, Pharaoh Seti II, as well as an obelisk. \nEgypt\u2019s Antiquities Ministry is calling the find one of the most important ever, according to Reuters. \"We found the bust of the statue and the lower part of the head and now we removed the head and we found the crown and the right ear and a fragment of the right eye,\" Egyptian antiquities minister Khaled al-Anani said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Anadolu Agency / Ibrahim Ramadan\n\n\nArchaeologists will continue to extract the other parts of the statues for study and restoration. If the larger statue is determined to be of Ramses II, it will be installed at the Grand Egyptian Museum next year, according to The Guardian. This isn\u2019t the first time that statues have been found in the area: in 2006, archaeologists discovered a four-ton statue believed to depict Ramses II in a marketplace. \nRamses II \u2014 also known as Ozymandias \u2014 was one of the empire\u2019s longest rulers, with a six-decade reign from 1279 BCE to 1213 BCE. He ruled during the height of Egypt\u2019s power in the region. The artifacts were discovered in what was one of the oldest cities in ancient Egypt, Heliopolis, which contained a massive temple dedicated to the ruler. The city was known for its temples and historical records by the time Greece expanded its empire to encompass Egypt. However, it was eclipsed by the rise of neighboring cities Cairo and Alexandria, and its temples and statues were dismantled for raw materials. \n"}
