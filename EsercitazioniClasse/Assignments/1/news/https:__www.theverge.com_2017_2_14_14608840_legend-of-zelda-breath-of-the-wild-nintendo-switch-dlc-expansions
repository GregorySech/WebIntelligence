{"title": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is getting $20 worth of downloadable extras", "content": " \nDownloadable content is invading Hyrule. Today Nintendo revealed that the upcoming Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be getting a series of paid downloadable add-ons, a first for a mainline Zelda game.\nStarting March 3rd \u2014 the same day Breath of the Wild launches \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to purchase an \u201cexpansion pass\u201d for $19.99 in both the Switch and Wii U versions of the game. While this will get you a few small extras on launch day, the real meat comes from two DLC packs that will be available later in the year. The first, which is coming this summer, will feature a new cave to explore, a harder difficulty level, and new map features. The second is coming sometime during the holiday 2017 window, and will include a new dungeon and what Nintendo describes as a \u201cnew original story\u201d to play through. Nintendo notes that the two packs \u201ccannot be purchased individually.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith this additional content, we\u2019d like to give even seasoned Hyrule explorers something new and fun,\u201d says Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma. While this is new territory for a major Zelda release, it\u2019s far from the first time Nintendo has experimented with DLC. Most notably, the company released a series of new paid characters, courses, and vehicles for Mario Kart 8 on Wii U \u2014 including a motorcycle-riding version of Zelda\u2019s own Link.\n"}
