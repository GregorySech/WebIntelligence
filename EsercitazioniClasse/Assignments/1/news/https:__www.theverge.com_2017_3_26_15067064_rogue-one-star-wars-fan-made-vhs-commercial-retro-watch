{"title": "This fan-made VHS commercial for Rogue One is delightfully retro", "content": " \nRogue One, A Star Wars Story will soon be available on DVD and Blu-ray (the digital version was released on Friday), but there\u2019s one format that the film won\u2019t be released in: VHS. A fan-made commercial imagines how such a release might have been advertised in the 1980s. \nFrom the commercial\u2019s editing to Anthony Sevins\u2019 dramatic voiceover, the short is a perfect throwback to the VHS era. The grainy footage and retro box art looks exactly like something one would have found in your neighborhood video rental shop back in the day, before Netflix drove them out of business. \n"}
