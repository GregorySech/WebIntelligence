{"title": "Lenovo\u2019s Surface competitor has Intel\u2019s new quad-core processors, LTE, and a 3D camera", "content": " \nLenovo is making its Surface competitor a lot better this year. After slow iterating the Miix tablet from its Core M roots, the new Miix 520 will include Intel\u2019s 8th generation quad-core i7 processor. It\u2019s an addition that pushes its CPU performance past Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Pro, alongside 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and a 12.2-inch 1920 x 1200 display. Lenovo also offers a USB-C port, the company\u2019s own active pen support, and an optional 3D camera for capturing images.\nLenovo is even offering an LTE version of the Miix 520 before Microsoft has managed to ship its own Surface Pro with LTE. Like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, the Miix 520 includes a detachable keyboard, and an adjustable kickstand. Lenovo is using its watchband hinge that the company typically uses on its Yoga line of convertible laptops. If you use Cortana, Microsoft\u2019s digital assistant, with your voice then the Miix 520 also has far-field microphones that can pick up your requests up to four meters away.\nWhile the design hasn\u2019t changed much from last year\u2019s Miix 510, the new Miix 520 will ship in both light and dark grey options. The light grey is very similar to the Surface Pro, but the \u201ciron grey\u201d as Lenovo calls it is more of a black look that\u2019s a welcome departure from the regular grey typically found on these Surface-like devices. Lenovo is planning to make the Miix 520 available in October, starting at $999.99 with the keyboard and stylus included (take note, Microsoft).\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
