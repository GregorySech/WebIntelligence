Investigators have identified Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman in the shooting, which unfolded in the town of Sutherland Springs.\n\"Unfortunately, at this point in time, we are unable to get into that phone,\u201d Combs said. \nThe comments echo other high-profile incidents where the FBI said it was blocked from accessing a phone because of encryption technology used in devices. Most memorably, the FBI and Apple went to court last year in a major legal dispute over whether the company could be forced to help law enforcement access a phone used by the shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino attack. \n\n\nFBI official, citing encryption tech, says federal agents have not been able to access the Texas shooter's phone https://t.co/CacbcOGFxq\u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) November 7, 2017\n\n\n\nCombs explicitly drew the connection between the Texas shooter\u2019s encrypted device and those used by others. \u201cIt highlights an issue that you\u2019ve all heard about before, with the advance of the technology and the phones and the encryptions [sic], law enforcement, whether that\u2019s at the state, local or federal level, is increasingly not able to get into these phones,\u201d he said. \nCombs said he would not describe which phone was used because he did not want to \u201ctell every bad guy out there what phone to buy.\u201d \nIn the case of the San Bernardino shooting, the FBI ultimately paid about $1 million for a hacking tool that allowed investigators to access the device, an iPhone 5C. Just last month, a federal judge ruled that the FBI would not have to disclose any details on the hack. \n"}
