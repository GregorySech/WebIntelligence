Variety reports that Liman stepped down to focus on the upcoming sci-fi film Chaos Walking. Liman is the latest director to walk away from a DC Extended Universe project, but Warner Bros. is already looking for replacements.\nJustice League Dark, also known by the title Dark Universe (sorry, Universal), is a superhero team-up movie that focuses on DC\u2019s supernatural heroes, with characters like John Constantine, Zatanna, and Deadman expected to join the lineup. Liman left Fox\u2019s Gambit to direct the film last year, replacing Guillermo del Toro at the helm after the Pacific Rim director left the project in 2015.\nOf course, Liman already has a very full plate. In addition to Chaos Walking, which recently got the greenlight and stars Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley, he\u2019s promoting his upcoming Iraq war movie The Wall and working on the follow-up to 2014\u2019s Edge of Tomorrow, titled Live Die Repeat and Repeat.\nLiman\u2019s departure comes at a tough time for DC movies\nLiman\u2019s departure comes at a tough time for DC movies. Justice League director and DCEU architect Zack Snyder announced earlier this week that he was stepping down from the film due to a family tragedy. Avengers and Batgirl solo film director Joss Whedon was tapped to ferry the project through post-production. Meanwhile, DC films are no stranger to lost directors. The Flash, starring Ezra Miller in the title role, has gone through two directors to date, having lost both Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa. TheWrap reports that Warner Bros. is in talks with a number of directors to replace Liman, including It\u2019s Andy Muschietti. Hopefully things stick this time.\n\n \n"}
