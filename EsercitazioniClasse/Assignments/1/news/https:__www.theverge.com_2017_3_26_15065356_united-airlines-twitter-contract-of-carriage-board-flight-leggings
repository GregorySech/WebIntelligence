{"title": "United refused to let three girls board a flight because they were wearing leggings", "content": " \nThis morning, a United Airlines passenger took to Twitter to complain that a gate agent refused to let three passengers board because they were wearing leggings. The airline said that its rules allow airline personnel to refuse service for passengers who aren\u2019t properly attired. \nThis post has been updated. \nThe incident appears to have happened during boarding for a flight headed to Minneapolis from Denver. Twitter user Shannon Watts noted that her complaint originated when the gate agent refused to allow three girls to board their flight, and asked why the airline was policing clothing choices. While one girl was ultimately allowed to fly after changing, two others were reportedly not. \n\n\n1) A @united gate agent isn't letting girls in leggings get on flight from Denver to Minneapolis because spandex is not allowed?\u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n2) She's forcing them to change or put dresses on over leggings or they can't board. Since when does @united police women's clothing?\u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Gate agent for flt 215 at 7:55. Said she doesn't make the rules, just follows them. I guess @united not letting women wear athletic wear?\u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\nAccording to a United customer service official on Twitter, the airline\u2019s Contract of Carriage allows airline personnel to refuse service to, or even remove passengers \u201cfor the safety of such Passenger or other Passengers,\u201d which includes passengers \u201cwho are barefoot or not properly clothed.\u201d In a follow-up tweet, the airline said that this decision is left to the gate agent\u2019s discretion.\nWatts\u2019 tweets attracted attention, and the problem has become a small public relations issue for the airline, as a number of other users have taken to Twitter to complain about the decision. They pointed to the vague nature of the language, the discretion allowed for gate agents, and the perception that the airline is allowed to police clothing for girls and women. \nAfter the initial posts, the customer service agent addressed complaints with the same language: \u201cUA shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage.\u201d\n\n\n@kerry_g537  UA shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage. ^FS\u2014 United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n@raleigh_mecklin UA shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage. ^FS\u2014 United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n@ElesaCooperson UA shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage. ^FS\u2014 United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n@geesemom UA shall have the right to refuse passengers if they are not properly clothed via our Contract of Carriage. ^FS\u2014 United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\nThe airline rep has since said that the company acknowledged \u201cthe severity of the situation,\u201d and that they are looking into it, and has reminded other users that the passengers weren\u2019t properly attired. \nUpdate March 26th, 2:36PM ET: United posted a tweet to address the issue, noting that the passengers in question were United Pass Riders \u2014 passengers who fly under employee pass privileges, either employees or family members of employees. \n\n\nThe passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel.\u2014 United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\n\n\nA United spokesperson spoke to Colorado\u2019s 9 News, and explained that the three passengers in question were not permitted to board because they didn\u2019t meet the criteria for Pass riders, who are held to the company\u2019s internal dress code standards. She also noted that \u201cyoga pants or leggings are more than welcome for regular paying customers.\u201d The spokesperson did not release a copy of the dress code, saying that it was an internal document. \nWe\u2019ve reached out to United for comment, and will update if we hear further. \n"}
