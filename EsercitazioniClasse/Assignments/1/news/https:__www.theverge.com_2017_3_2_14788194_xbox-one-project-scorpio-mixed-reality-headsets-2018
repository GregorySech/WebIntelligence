{"title": "Xbox One and Project Scorpio will support mixed reality headsets next year", "content": " \nMicrosoft is planning to support mixed reality headsets on Xbox One and the upcoming Project Scorpio console in 2018. The software giant revealed the launch timing at the Games Developers Conference this week, while shipping Windows Mixed Reality (previously Windows Holographic) headsets to developers. \u201cOur plan is to bring mixed reality content to the Xbox One family of devices, including Project Scorpio, in 2018,\u201d says a Microsoft spokesperson.\nWhile Microsoft originally revealed that Project Scorpio was VR-ready, it appears we\u2019ll have to wait until next year to experience Microsoft\u2019s mixed reality vision for its upcoming console. That's an unusual delay, and means Project Scorpio will launch later this year without support for these new headsets. Sony launched its own PlayStation VR back in October.\nXbox One owners will be happy to hear that they\u2019re not being left behind, though. A number of PC makers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer are planning to introduce Windows Mixed Reality headsets that will now work across Windows 10 PCs, Xbox One, and Project Scorpio. Acer\u2019s headset will ship to developers this month, alongside Microsoft enabling its Windows Mixed Reality shell inside the latest Windows 10 Creators Update.\n \n"}
