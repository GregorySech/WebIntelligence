{"title": "Atomic Blonde is a good movie improved by an exceptional soundtrack", "content": " \nAtomic Blonde is a violent, neon-drenched pleasure romp. Charlize Theron is in her finest action form as an ass-kicking MI6 agent who can crack a man\u2019s skull in \u2014 or sometimes with \u2014 a fine pair of heels. But her best accessory? The film\u2019s killer soundtrack, a mix of \u201880s synthpop that elevates it above typical action-genre fanfare. \nWith every superbly choreographed move Theron takes, there is an equally perfect song added for garnish. The film leans into its 1989 setting by collecting some of the best songs of the decade, then unleashing them at the most unexpected moments. Nena\u2019s \u201c99 Luftballoons\u201d is the background track for a brutal interrogation; \u2018Til Tuesday\u2019s \u201cVoices Carry\u201d becomes a ballad of tension as two characters struggle for their lives. Not a single song in the film feels like a whiff, whether it\u2019s David Bowie / Queen\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d or Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cBehind the Wheel.\u201d\nAtomic Blonde relishes cheeky use of diegetic sound. Theron uses George Michael\u2019s \u201cFather Figure\u201d to give herself a noisy cover when she finds herself pinned down in an apartment. Other scenes see characters blasting the scene\u2019s music from their radios, only for the track to cut at the most dramatic moment.\n\nThe movie won\u2019t hit theaters until July 28th, but this is one of those rare times when its bombastic trailer (featuring both Queen\u2019s \u201cKiller Queen\u201d and Health\u2019s \u201cBlue Monday\u201d) perfectly captures its tone without spoiling every detail. There\u2019s a defiant, synthpunk feel to Atomic Blonde, from the spray paint-style on-screen captions for time and place to Theron and James McAvoy\u2019s equally stylish hairstyles. But it\u2019s the film\u2019s soundtrack that truly reveals its personality \u2014 and makes its best scenes unforgettable moments that will continue playing in my mind on loop.\n\n\n\n\n"}
