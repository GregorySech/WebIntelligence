{"title": "Here are the 2017 Hugo Award nominees", "content": " \nThe finalists for the 2017 Hugo Awards were announced this morning, and the ballot includes a refreshing number of women and authors of color in what has been a historically white male-dominated field.\nThe Hugo Awards, named after Amazing Stories editor Hugo Gernsback, are awarded to recognize the best work in fantasy and science fiction from the previous year. The annual ceremony has been held almost every year since the Hugos\u2019 inception in 1953. The Hugos are overseen by the World Science Fiction Society at the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), with the awards collectively voted on by attendees and paying members of the society. \nThis year\u2019s Hugos will be presented at Worldcon 75, taking place in Helsinki, Finland, from August 9th\u201313th. The presentation ceremony will be held on August 11th, and is typically live-streamed online.\nThe 2017 nominees include some of the biggest books from last year, including All the Birds in the Sky, by former io9 editor Charlie Jane Anders; The Obelisk Gate, by N.K. Jemisin (who won last year\u2019s Best Novel Hugo for The Fifth Season); and Death\u2019s End, the final book in Cixin Liu\u2019s Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy. The ballot also covers movies, television, graphic novels, and other media. The Hugos recognize achievements in fantasy and science fiction over a wider range of media than the Nebula Awards, which are run by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and are more specifically focused on published writing. That said, both awards for works in 2016 feature some incredibly welcome diversity in the nominee lineup. \nThe Hugos have been unusually contentious over the past couple of years, with a pair of fan groups calling themselves the Sad Puppies and Rabid Puppies aggressively pushing voting slates favoring white men and conservative outlooks. Voters have consistently rejected Puppy-nominated works. This year, the Puppy groups were relatively muted, with only a few slated works making it to the finalist stage of voting.\nHere\u2019s the full list of 2017 nominees: \nBest Novel\n\n\nAll the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders (Tor Books / Titan Books)\n\nA Closed and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers (Hodder & Stoughton / Harper Voyager US)\n\nDeath\u2019s End by Cixin Liu (Tor Books / Head of Zeus)\n\nNinefox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee (Solaris Books)\n\nThe Obelisk Gate by N.
