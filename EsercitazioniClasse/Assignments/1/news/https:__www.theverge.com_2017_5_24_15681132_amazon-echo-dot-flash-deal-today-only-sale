{"title": "Amazon is having a rare one-day sale on the Echo Dot", "content": " \nIn the market for one, two, or even four devices to shout \u201cAlexa\u201d at? For the first time this year, Amazon is offering the Echo Dot for $39.99, making this the best Dot deal of the year.\nYou may remember last month when Amazon ran a promotion in which you\u2019d have to buy three Echo Dots to get $20 off. Until 12PM ET today, you can grab $10 off the Echo Dot \u2014 matching Black Friday for an all-time low price.\nUnlike previous discounts we\u2019ve seen on Amazon devices like the Kindle deal last March, today\u2019s deal is not exclusive to Amazon Prime members, allowing anyone to take advantage of this deal. \nThere\u2019s really not much more to be said since the deal speaks for itself. And hey, maybe you don\u2019t need four Dots \u2014 but then again, even that is $20 cheaper than buying just one Echo.  \nGood Deals is a weekly roundup of the best deals on the internet \u2014 and sometimes, in cases like this, deals that can\u2019t wait until the weekend \u2014 curated by Vox Media's commerce editor, Chloe Reznikov, in collaboration with The Verge's editorial team. You can submit deals to deals@theverge.com and find more Good Deals here.\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
