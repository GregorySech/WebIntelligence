{"title": "Teen who asked Wendy's for nuggets breaks all-time retweet record", "content": " \nNevada teen Carter Wilkerson has successfully ousted Ellen DeGeneres for the world record of the most retweeted tweet of all time. The title, previously held by DeGeneres at 3.4 million retweets, comes a little over a month after Wilkerson asked the Wendy\u2019s Twitter account how many retweets he would need for a free year\u2019s supply of chicken nuggets, and the company responded with \u201c18 million.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 9th, 9:36AM ET.\nImage: CartervsEllen.com\n\n\n\n\n.@carterjwm is now the most retweeted tweet of all-time. That\u2019s good for the nuggets, and $100k to @DTFA. Consider it done. #nuggsforcarter pic.twitter.com/k6uhsJiP4E\u2014 Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2017\n\n\n\nSince then, brands and celebrities have all poured their support for Wilkerson, from Apple Music, Google, and Microsoft to actor Aaron Paul, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, and Ellen DeGeneres herself. United tried to get in on the fun, too, but mostly this backfired just about immediately. Meanwhile, Twitter has granted Wilkerson a verified badge, and made a custom hashtag with emoji for the cause. It even included Wilkerson\u2019s tweet in its Q1 shareholder letter.\nWilkerson appeared on The Ellen Show on April 18th (about a week and a half since his initial tweet) where she proposed that if he makes it to 18 million retweets, she\u2019ll give him a special prize \u2014 but on the condition that he doesn\u2019t surpass her own record by asking fans to retweet both their accounts and surge to 18 million together. Whoops. Sorry, Ellen.\n\n\nNugget boy is here today. You know what they say... keep your friends close and your Twitter competition closer. pic.twitter.com/PA9Vfu2tY3\u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) April 18, 2017\n\n\n\nSince the tweet went viral, Wilkerson has pivoted his objective a bit \u2014 promising that once the record is broken, Wendy\u2019s will donate $100,000 to The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. Wendy\u2019s also confirmed that the teen will get his nuggets, though it didn\u2019t specify how many pieces he\u2019ll be allotted per day. For the amount of press the company got though, complying with Wilkerson\u2019s nuggets demand sounds like bargain.\n"}
