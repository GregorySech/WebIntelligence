{"title": "Nintendo on supply issues: \u2018Sometimes we get it wrong\u2019", "content": " \nLast night Nintendo made a surprise announcement: a brand-new piece of hardware is launching this summer in the form of the New Nintendo 2DS XL. That will mark the third major hardware release for the company in the span of nine months: the now-discontinued NES Classic Edition released in November, followed by the Nintendo Switch in March. The one common theme between these devices \u2014 and even the older Nintendo 3DS \u2014 is that they\u2019ve been incredibly supply constrained of late, making it difficult for consumers to actually purchase them.\nI had the chance to ask Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, president of Nintendo of America, about what exactly goes into the process of determining how many units to make of a particular product. \u201cWe create a plan, we build our programs against that plan,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut based on what we see in the marketplace we make adjustments, and we go from there.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \nEven with Switch, Nintendo is still focused on the 3DS \u2014 for now\n\nTake the Switch as an example. Nintendo originally planned to produce enough of the tablet / console hybrid to sell 2 million of them in the first month. But that number grew significantly \u2014 yesterday the company revealed that the system moved 2.76 million units in March. \u201cAs we began the ramp up with our communication activity, starting with the video we released in October, then the hands-on events that we did in January, clearly we began to see a consumer response that was very positive, and there was a lot of excitement,\u201d Fils-Aim\u00e9 explains. \u201cSo at that point we began to improve on our production capability.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Nintendo 2DS XL.\n\n\nOne thing that doesn\u2019t necessarily influence supply is the introduction of new platforms. A new 2DS likely won\u2019t have a dramatic impact on Switch production, just as Switch didn\u2019t greatly impact the NES Classic. \u201cIt\u2019s not a direct, one-for-one effect,\u201d says Fils-Aim\u00e9. \u201cCertainly there are some components that are common within a particular platform; so with 3DS for example, there are some common components. A great example: the AC adaptor is the same whether you\u2019re talking about a 2DS or a 3DS XL. It\u2019s the same adaptor. And there are some things that are shared between a 3DS platform and a Nintendo Switch. But what we try and do, is manage the overall business to deliver as much financial results as we can, and also as much consumer satisfaction as we can.\u201d (Of course, that doesn't necessarily preclude the idea that Nintendo is intentionally limiting stock to increase demand, as many have speculated.)\nSuccessfully meeting day one demand is a problem for most hardware companies \u2014 just ask Google. That said, Nintendo says it\u2019s confident that the supply issues that have plagued recent launches won\u2019t also hinder the release of the New Nintendo 2DS XL on July 28th. \u201cWe make estimates on what consumer demand is, and if the demand dramatically exceeds what we plan, it creates some tightness in the marketplace,\u201d says Fils-Aim\u00e9. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve estimated for New Nintendo 2DS XL pretty well, and we\u2019re confident that the consumer who wants to buy it on July 28th is going to be able to do that.\n\u201cWe get it right more times than we get it wrong. But sometimes we get it wrong.\u201d\n"}
