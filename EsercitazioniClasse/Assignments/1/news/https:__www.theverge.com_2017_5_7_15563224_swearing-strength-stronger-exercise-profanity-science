{"title": "Could swearing make you stronger at the gym? Maybe, so drop those F-bombs", "content": " \nHere\u2019s my confession: I am a prolific and unrepentant swearer. I drop F-bombs like I shed hair. And let me tell you, my shower drain is always clogged \u2014 you know, because I shed so much hair. \nAlong with being an expert in swear words and unclogging drains, I also love lifting heavy weights. I hadn\u2019t actually thought to combine my strength training and cursing hobbies until I found a small research study that said swearing, apparently, could make me stronger. \nThis study was actually a presentation at the Annual Conference of the British Psychological Society, and all I could see was the abstract. But it described 29 young adults who took short spins on exercise bikes, and another 52 people who squeezed grip-testers as hard as they could. Each group did one trial while repeating their favorite profanity in what the study\u2019s lead author, psychologist Richard Stephens, described to The Guardian as \u201can even tone.\u201d It\u2019s not really clear to me why the authors were investigating even-toned, repetitive swearing \u2014 even I can\u2019t string together multiple \u201cfucks\u201d while trying to squeeze out one more deadlift. You could say I can\u2019t give a fuck. Eh? Pretty good?\n\n\nFollow Verge Science on Facebook!\n\n\n\nPlastic-eating caterpillarsPlastic-eating caterpillars could solve our trash problem.\u200ePosted by Verge Science on\u200e \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 8 \u05de\u05d0\u05d9 2017\n\nA new place to follow smart science coverage that isn\u2019t overhyped and overblown.\n\n\nMoving on. The participants also did a clean run where they instead repeated a neutral word like \u201cwooden\u201d or \u201cbrown.\u201d  The prompt, according to The Guardian, was to use a word describing a table. During the profanity-spiked trials, the abstract reports that participants spun faster and squeezed harder than during the runs where they had to repeat \u201cwooden, wooden, wooden.\u201d\nThis builds on earlier findings from the same lab that spewing profanity allows people to keep their hands in ice water for longer. But there are, obviously, a bunch of caveats: It was a small study. And since it\u2019s a conference presentation, it probably hasn\u2019t been through the full process of peer review \u2014 where other psychologists would pick apart the study for flaws and inconsistencies before it\u2019s published. \nThere also wasn\u2019t enough detail in the conference abstract to tell if the scientists compared swearing runs to, say, silence or other socially less-acceptable words that aren\u2019t typically thrown around as expletives (like: urethra, urethra, urethra). And then there\u2019s the possibility of the placebo effect \u2014 after all, it\u2019s really hard to blind the participants or the researchers to whether or not someone\u2019s cursing. \nIf the study didn\u2019t already pair two of my favorite things \u2014 fitness and swearing \u2014 I probably would have ignored it. But if all it takes to finally break 185 on my squats is to repeatedly mutter F-bombs in \u201can even tone,\u201d I\u2019m willing to try it. You know, for the sake of my health.\n"}
