{"title": "Why I love PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds despite hating online shooters", "content": " \nIf ever there were any doubt that PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds is one of the biggest hits of the year, some new numbers last night confirmed it. The breakout shooter reached number 4 in Steam\u2019s ranking of most concurrent players ever, its figure of 382,561 beating out Grand Theft Auto V and coming in behind Fallout 4. At one point Battlegrounds was also the most-watched game on Twitch, too; a lot of people are playing and watching this game.\nNot bad for a game that hasn\u2019t even officially been released yet. And Battlegrounds didn\u2019t go about this the easy way. It saddled itself with an unwieldy name, forcing most players to refer to it as the even less penetrable PUBG (rhymes with sub-G). It also came out in Steam\u2019s Early Access program for games that are still in development, with all the instability that implies. To call the game visually unappealing would be kind, despite the fairly hefty system requirements, and even players on powerful hardware are likely to run into major bugs.\nHow on earth did it get so popular, then? Well, all you need to do is hook up your LED-ridden mechanical keyboard and multi-button gaming mouse to find out. I almost never play online shooters, let alone online shooters as ugly and seemingly hardcore as PUBG, and I\u2019m not really into watching livestreams either. But it only takes one round to understand why this game is so special.\n\n\nAgain, your support of @PUBATTLEGROUNDS astounds me! We just surpassed GTAV & achieved the 4th highest peak player count on @steam_games <3 pic.twitter.com/UGtSJX3GYR\u2014 PLAYERUNKNOWN (@BattleRoyaleMod) July 16, 2017\n\n\n\nPUBG is one of the most elegantly designed shooters ever created. Here\u2019s how it works: up to a hundred unarmed players parachute down into a vast map. They find weapons, armor, and vehicles. As time passes, the safe play area shrinks, forcing players into the same region of the map. The last person alive wins. \nAnyone can jump in and have a meaningful experience\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. And yes, you may have noticed that \u201cit\u201d is pretty much the movie Battle Royale in video game form. In fact, PUBG's namesake creator Brendan \u201cPlayerUnknown\u201d Greene cut his teeth developing similar mods for games like ARMA 2 and 3. PUBG, however, is built entirely around this structure, and it\u2019s this purity and focus that makes it so accessible. The game\u2019s balance is a lot less forgiving than Halo or Call of Duty, but it\u2019s not quite as harshly realistic as ARMA.\nWhat this means is that basically anyone can jump in and have a meaningful experience. Everyone starts in the same vulnerable situation, and every kill is significant. Winning \u2014 or being the last person standing \u2014 is immensely difficult, but since the scoring system is so simple it\u2019s always tempting to try to improve your ranking next time. And PUBG isn\u2019t shy about including elements of luck; even the most skilled player might find themselves landing in an area oddly bereft of weaponry beyond a frying pan and getting rifled in the back.\nEvery time I\u2019ve managed to be one of the last ten players remaining has been among the most intense gaming experiences of my life. Everything you do becomes a small but profound decision. Do you wait inside that room and stay safe for now, but risk having to blow your own cover when the play area gets smaller? Do you attack that other player now, or hope she doesn\u2019t notice you and wanders into a more compromised position down the line? Do you draw attention to yourself by using a loud vehicle to cover more ground, or can you make it to the safe zone in time while keeping quiet?\n\nPUBG has none of the trappings of online shooters that I\u2019ve found so off-putting for the past decade. There\u2019s no way to reliably game the map, no requirement to put up with usually offensive voice chat, no oppressive metagame that requires you to spend every waking hour playing if you have any hope of catching up. Each game rarely lasts more than half an hour, and even that\u2019s only if you\u2019re playing very well. Anyone with a basic grasp of shooters can have fun with PUBG.\nThat said, the game is clearly unfinished. You may find yourself cursing the netcode when you die due to lag. The visuals are distinctly unpretty, even if you\u2019re not one of the many players that turns down everything except draw distance for competitive reasons. Jumping over knee-high obstacles is weirdly difficult. And you need a beefy Windows PC right now, despite the unimpressive results.\nBut PUBG is coming to consoles sometime this year, with a launch first on Xbox One, and by that point it should be a more robust, widely palatable game. Microsoft already demonstrated the ability to vault over fences and cars, which will make a huge difference. Even in its current state, however, and even considering that 2017 has been one of the best ever years for video games, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds is already one of the best games of the year. It\u2019s janky, unattractive, and thematically unappealing, sure. But it\u2019s also kind of my perfect game. \nIf you're curious to find out more, The Verge will be facing off against a team from Polygon later today and streaming the battle live. Stay tuned for more info.\n"}
