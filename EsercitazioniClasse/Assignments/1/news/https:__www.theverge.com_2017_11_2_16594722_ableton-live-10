{"title": "Ableton Live 10 introduces some long-desired features", "content": " \nDeveloper Ableton has announced Live 10, the next version of its popular music production software. Live 9, Ableton\u2019s last major upgrade to the title, came out in 2013 alongside the debut of Push, a hardware controller for Live with 64 pads designed to play and program beats.\nThere\u2019s a lot of new, notable changes to Live in version 10. Ableton is introducing four new plugins \u2014 the tools used for everything from sound creation to signal processing \u2014 that will come standard with the software: Wavetable, a synth that promises \u201cdeep, flexible modulation,\u201d Echo, a multi-purpose delay unit for adding texture, Drum Buss, an all-in-one drum sculpting tool, and Pedal, which delivers overdrive and warm distortion. Some previous plugins have been given a refresh: Utility now has an improved gain range and the ability to mono bass separately, and EQ Eight and Split Stereo Pan have extended low frequency slopes for finer control. You can also look forward to a new library of sounds.\nOne of the more exciting new features in Live 10 might be initially glossed over by many: Collections. Ableton describes Collections as a way to organize favorite or most-used plugins, sounds, and more, but really, it\u2019s a customizable tagging system. It\u2019s literally something I pined for in a tweet earlier this year.\n\n\nMan how cool would it be if Ableton let you organize your sample library with assigned tags instead of a traditional folder structure\u2014 Dani Deahl (@danideahl) June 30, 2017\n\n\n\nAbleton\u2019s Collections don\u2019t quite work the way I had envisioned (which was more akin to Soundbase tags), but they\u2019re still super useful. A Collection is essentially a tag, marked by a title and designated color. They appear in the program\u2019s left hand navigation, and items can be tagged to appear in multiple Collections. In the example below, the Glue Compressor is marked by green, purple, and gray squares as it\u2019s been tagged for the \u201cFavourite Effects,\u201d \u201cMixing,\u201d and \u201cMastering\u201d Collections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Ableton\n\n\nHow Collections are organized and named is up to the user. Maybe more straightforward Collections like \u201cFavorite Vocals\u201d make sense for you. Or, you could create Collections based around types of sounds, like \u201cPop\u201d or \u201cGrime.\u201d The system\u2019s not quite perfect \u2014 Collections are only top-level tags. I couldn\u2019t, say, search for a sound tagged both \u201cKick Drum\u201d and \u201cDistorted\u201d (which was my dream situation) \u2014 I\u2019d have to create a separate Collection for \u201cDistorted Kick Drums.\u201d That said, Collections should still prove a practical(ish) way to categorize and easily access frequently used elements.\nLive 10 introduces the option to export audio as .MP3\nOther workflow changes for Live 10 include the introduction of groups within groups, the ability to rename Live\u2019s inputs and outputs, multiple MIDI clip editing, which allows for the content of two or more clips to be displayed in one view, a multitude of new keyboard shortcuts and clip interactions, and at last, the option to export audio as .MP3. Live 10 will also support note chasing, which is the ability to trigger and play a MIDI note even if playback is started in the middle. Other Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) like Logic and Pro Tools already have note chasing, but currently in Live 9, MIDI has to be frozen (bounced to audio in the background) in order to initiate playback from the middle of a MIDI note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbleton Live 10\u2019s new Wavetable synth\nImage: Ableton\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a new feature called Capture, which is a mechanism always running in the background that\u2019s listening for and temporarily cacheing MIDI input. Capture can recall MIDI notes previously played in a session, even if they weren\u2019t recorded. Say you\u2019re messing around on a keyboard and stumble upon the perfect chord or melody \u2014 Ableton will remember it, even if you can\u2019t. Simply click Capture, and the MIDI is recalled, available to place in your project. It even guesses the tempo, and assigns the notes accordingly.\nOne change you won\u2019t see but will help with your CPU load: Max for Live is now fully built into Live 10. A programming environment that allows users to build their own instruments and effects, Max for Live was previously supported as an add-on product for purchase but will now come already integrated in the software itself. This means Max for Live devices should be more stable, load faster, and use less CPU.\nCapture can recall MIDI notes previously played in a session, even if they weren\u2019t recorded\nThe graphics in Live\u2019s interface have been touched up, and are now sharper, with a thinner font used for clip and channel titling. There\u2019s also some small color changes and a range of new skins, all of which Ableton says will make the program easier to read across different displays and in a variety of environments, from dark clubs to brighter workspaces. If the screenshots of Live 10 are anything to go by, it is crisper than how Live 9 currently looks on my MacBook.\nPush, Ableton\u2019s hardware component for Live, has a few updates of its own. Notes in a clip are now displayed directly on Push, the interfaces for several devices \u2014 like Wavetable and EQ Eight \u2014 can now be displayed on Push\u2019s screen, and a new step sequencing layout allows for note sequencing and real time playing to happen concurrently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Ableton\n\n\nAbleton Live 10 will be available in early 2018 for purchase at Ableton.com and various retailers.
