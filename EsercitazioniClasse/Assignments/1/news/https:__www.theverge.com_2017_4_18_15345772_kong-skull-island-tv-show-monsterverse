{"title": "Following Kong: Skull Island, a TV show called King Kong Skull Island", "content": " \nKong: Skull Island, the second entry in Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cMonsterVerse,\u201d which also includes 2014\u2019s Godzilla, as well as the upcoming film Godzilla: King of Monsters (2019), and the inevitable Godzilla vs. Kong (2020), hit theaters just over a month ago.  \nNow, as reported by Deadline, there will be a not-totally-related King Kong TV show called King Kong Skull Island. It will reportedly feature \u201ca female-led, multicultural ensemble that delves into the wonders and horrors of Skull Island and its origins.\u201d \n\n\n    Related\n  \nHow Industrial Light & Magic built a better Kong for Skull Island\n\nThe live-action series will be written by The Bye Bye Man\u2019s Jonathan Penner and Stacy Title, adapted from the novelization of Merian C. Cooper\u2019s original 1932 film King Kong and DeVito Artworks\u2019 Skull Island comics. IM Global is co-producing the series (it does not yet have a network attached), and president Mark Stern explained the choice to Deadline saying \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a deep and abiding interest in this timeless story.\u201d A timeless story about a really big animal that exists in the same universe as a different really big animal. Coming to a small screen near you. \nThe first two films in the \u201cMonsterVerse\u201d have together raked in over $1 billion for Warner Bros. at the box office, so it\u2019s clear why TV producers would want in. And it is, I suppose, worth noting that both those films have Rotten Tomatoes scores about three times those of the studio\u2019s recent superhero films, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (28 percent) and the Academy Award-winning Suicide Squad (25 percent). \n\nWhat would movie monsters actually sound like?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
