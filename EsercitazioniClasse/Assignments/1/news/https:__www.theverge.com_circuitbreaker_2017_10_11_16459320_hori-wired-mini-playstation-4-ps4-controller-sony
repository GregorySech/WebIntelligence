{"content": " Do you think the PlayStation 4\u2019s DualShock 4 controller is too big? Then Hori\u2019s new adorable-looking Wired Mini Gamepad might just be the controller for you. The miniature controller works like a regular DualShock, with all the buttons and triggers that you\u2019d expect. Even the touch pad is there, sort of: there\u2019s a dedicated button to simulate a click on top of the controller, and a \u201cTP\u201d button on the bottom that lets you use control sticks to simulate the gestures. And while it\u2019s a wired controller, the cord is three meters long  or just shy of 10 feet , so unless you\u2019ve got a really huge living room, it should reach your couch just fine. The new controller is the latest in a series of officially licensed PS4 controllers that Sony is releasing, following the first pair, which launched last December. Along with the Hori Wired Mini Gamepad, there are also new options from @PLAY and Nacon, which are decidedly less interesting, but worth a look if you really hate Sony\u2019s own controller option for some reason. The Hori Wired Mini Gamepad is set to launch on November 6th, although no price has been announced yet. ", "title": "Hori\u2019s new miniature PS4 controller looks adorable"}
