{"title": "Movie theaters are becoming roller coasters, whether you like it or not", "content": " \nToday, Cars 3 becomes the first Pixar film to be distributed in 4DX, the motion-based \u201cimmersive\u201d film format from Seoul\u2019s CJ 4DPlex. 4DX is one of a handful of formats that attempt to turn traditional, passive filmgoing into something more experiential: seats shake, tilt, and pivot, while environmental effects like air blasts, scents, sprays of water, and in-theater fog and strobe lighting echo what\u2019s happening on the screen. Imagine Star Tours, only while you\u2019re watching a movie, and you\u2019ll get the idea.\n4DX and its competitors have largely been focusing on bombastic superhero movies and action flicks, and while animated 4DX films are nothing new \u2014 Despicable Me was released in the format back in 2010, and last year everything from Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book to Kung Fu Panda 3 got the treatment \u2014 it\u2019s hard to not see the Pixar release as an inflection point. One of the most prestigious modern animated film studios, winner of 16 Academy Awards, is having its latest film released in a format that is arguably more of theme park experience than a cinematic one.  \nIt\u2019s symptomatic of an industry struggling to give audiences something they simply can\u2019t get online or from their television at home. And whether it\u2019s extra-large screens or vibrating seats, the concept of making filmgoing \u201cimmersive\u201d has become the latest trend. But enveloping audiences in a fictional world requires more than just technological add-ons. And in the mad rush to entice audiences into theaters, these new formats could undermine the most important reason to go to the movies of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a big surprise that technologies like 4DX \u2014 like IMAX or 3D before them \u2014 are appealing to theater owners and studios. Movie attendance in the United States is shrinking, and increases in ticket prices are what actually drive the perception of a healthy, robust theatrical business. According to data from the National Association of Theater Owners, the average ticket price in the US has increased more than 30 percent over the last 10 years, while North American box office grosses have actually grown just 24 percent. It\u2019s a war of attrition and Hollywood is losing. And with so many entertainment options available to audiences, these technology-driven theatrical experiences offer a dual benefit: they\u2019re something viewers can\u2019t re-create in their living rooms, and they simultaneously justify a more expensive ticket.\nBut just because something is appealing from a business perspective doesn\u2019t mean it makes for a great moviegoing experience. After James Cameron\u2019s Avatar legitimized 3D filmmaking, audiences were assaulted with a torrent of poorly converted 3D films that still give the format a bad name. In similar fashion, the experience of motion-driven, \u201c4D\u201d filmgoing can range wildly, with my colleague Sam Byford calling 4DX \u201ca gimmick at best\u201d after watching Iron Man 3, to saying that 4D was a must-watch for The Force Awakens.\nAs a coherent immersive experience, it fails completely\nI recently went to a 4DX screening of Wonder Woman in Los Angeles, and I wouldn\u2019t characterize the overall experience as pleasant. The extra $8 per ticket was the first sticking point, and then both my wife and I felt vaguely queasy after viewing just the 4DX hype trailer. Things progressed as you\u2019d expect from there. Watching a film in 4DX can be a jarring, jolting experience \u2014 but in fairness, so can a theme park ride. 4DX, however, touts itself as an \u201cimmersive multi-sensory cinematic experience.\u201d That magic phrase \u2014 immersive experience \u2014 is the thread that unites everything I write about in this column, and it\u2019s where 4DX fails completely. \nThere are two distinctly different elements to the 4DX experience: the motion of the seat, and the environmental effects. The seat tilts, shakes, and rolls to essentially track the movement of the camera from shot to shot. It\u2019s Camera Operator: The Simulator, which would be fine by itself if it wasn\u2019t for the environmental effects. Those cue off of literally anything. In one moment during Wonder Woman, 3D arrows being shot toward the audience triggered blasts of air, creating the illusion that the film was spilling out of the screen and into the auditorium. In another moment, though, I watched a character fall off a horse and land on the ground \u2014 triggering a quick, uncomfortable jab in my back from what the company calls a \u201cback kicker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Warner Bros.\n\n\nAs a piece of immersive entertainment, it\u2019s utterly discordant. There\u2019s not a coherent experience with a consistent point of view that\u2019s being delivered to the audience; instead, it plays like a collection of effects shoved in wherever they can be justified. As 4DX creative director Catherine Yi later explained to me on the phone, the company uses two different editors: one for motion, and one for the environmental effects. Those individuals stay in constant communication during the process, but there\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule about perspective or continuity that the company abides by in crafting its experiences.\n\u201cAt the very beginning stages of our company, nobody had a lot of experience doing this. So in the beginning, our editors were really going by trial and error,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat ended up happening was if you just choose one character, or one point of view, there are a lot of holes [in the effects and motion], and it becomes a little bit jarring. [So] we try things. And if it works, and if it seems seamless and natural, then we go with that.\u201d\nEffective motion simulators carefully match movement with on-screen action\nThe problem is that seems to be a philosophy based on maximizing the usage of the effects, rather than their utility. The 4DX experience with Wonder Woman didn\u2019t pull me into the film, it continuously shoved me out. When I\u2019m wondering why my seat is punching me in the back instead of focusing on the outcome of the battle on-screen, it\u2019s a sign that the format is actively harming the movie in question.\nThat\u2019s largely because systems like 4DX are essentially grafting motion simulator ride tricks onto mediums that were never designed with them in mind. When going on a ride like Flight of Passage at Disney\u2019s new Avatar land, or taking a trip on Star Tours or Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout, there\u2019s a carefully choreographed dance taking place. The on-screen visuals and environmental cues work together with the ride vehicle to deliver an experience that simulates something very specific. Audiences can actually feel like they\u2019re heading into a space battle, or taking a ride on the back of a Banshee. Technologies like 4DX, on the other hand, can\u2019t do that because the movies they\u2019re piggybacking on were never designed as first-person experiences. \nThe end result definitely can\u2019t be duplicated at home \u2014 but it turns what could be a satisfying filmgoing experience into a roller-coaster ride of distraction. Perhaps that\u2019s a net positive when dealing with a movie that has no coherent story or characters worth following \u2014 Transformers: Age of Extinction was the first 4DX film released in the US, after all \u2014 but for something like Wonder Woman, it actively prevented me from enjoying a film I had already seen once and liked.\n\nThe same kind of awkward fit applies when looking at other new technologies that bill themselves as enhanced cinematic experiences. 4DX sister company ScreenX is pushing a new panoramic format that uses two additional screens placed at the edges of the traditional frame for a wider field of view. (The latest Pirates of the Caribbean served as its first Hollywood blockbuster.) Barco\u2019s Escape format has been doing something similar for the past few years, with movies like Star Trek Beyond getting the extra-wide treatment. But for the most part these are cases where supplemental content is added to the extra screens well after the actual film has been storyboarded and shot, keeping them from feeling like organic parts of the film itself.  \nDespite the problems, however, there\u2019s no sign of these format explorations slowing. 4DX currently has 380 screens in 48 different countries, with its nine US locations expanding, thanks to a partnership with Regal Cinemas. \u201cWe\u2019re a household name in places like Korea, China, and in Latin American countries,\u201d Yi says. \u201cBecause the US is so much bigger, we\u2019re still working on becoming a household name here.\u201d\nAnd in terms of sheer revenue, that ticket surcharge does pay off. According to the company, 4DX theaters showing Wonder Woman averaged more than three times as much box office revenue as non-4DX screens in the same locations, with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales pushing that number even higher. Granted, these numbers are largely due to the higher ticket prices versus any innate audience reaction \u2014 but for theater owners, that may not make much of a difference.\nIn terms of revenue, that ticket surcharge does pay off\nIf it\u2019s able to scale, that kind of financial result may be what drives the industry even further in this direction. If films became available for home rental sooner than they currently are \u2014 and all signs point to this happening eventually \u2014 then perhaps turning movie theaters into roller coasters, or VR arcades, becomes the way forward. Whether or not it actually benefits the filmgoing experience will be secondary in that case; it will simply be a question of economic survival. \nThankfully, there are plenty of other new options that focus almost exclusively on improving the quality of the presentation itself. IMAX\u2019s upcoming film release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk, or Dolby Vision\u2019s laser projection system, enhance the traditional cinematic experience. They don\u2019t try to tack on \u201cimmersive\u201d bells and whistles or expanded-screen gimmicks. They simply let the movies themselves be as good as they can possibly be when audiences sit down with their popcorn.\nOf course, that approach only works if the films themselves are good and connect with audiences. When every blockbuster is a tired sequel, or a poor attempt to start yet another expanded cinematic universe\u2026 well, maybe then a roller coaster \u2014 even a bad one \u2014 isn\u2019t the most abominable idea. I do still need to see The Mummy, after all.\n"}
