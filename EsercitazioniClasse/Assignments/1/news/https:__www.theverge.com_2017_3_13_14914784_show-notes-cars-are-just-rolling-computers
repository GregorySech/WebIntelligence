{"title": "Show Notes: Cars are just rolling computers", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nShow Notes will be a bit lighter than usual this week, as I\u2019m at SXSW this week with a bunch of Verge reporters and people from across Vox Media. SXSW itself seems a bit slower on tech side than usual, but the culture team keeps finding great stuff. Keep up with everything in our SXSX 2017 StoryStream here.\nTHE VERGECAST LIVE\nThe main reason I\u2019m at SXSW is to do two episodes of The Vergecast Live on the National Geographic Further stage with Dieter, Lauren Goode, Casey Newton, Chris Plante, and Megan Farokhmanesh. We taped our first episode yesterday with Lauren and Casey in front of a great crowd (the line went around the block!) and it was super fun. We\u2019re doing another episode tomorrow, so if you\u2019re at SXSW come check it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vergecast is live at SXSW!The Vergecast is live at SXSW! We've put Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Casey Newton, and Lauren Goode on a stage in front of humans and next to an open bar. So um... let's see how that goes.Posted by The Verge on Sunday, March 12, 2017\n\n\nCARS ARE JUST ROLLING COMPUTERS\n\n\nIntel spent $15 billion to buy Mobileye, a company that develops self-driving tech, notably in vision and collision avoidance. The last time most Verge readers heard of Mobileye was probably after Tesla dropped the company\u2019s tech following that fatal Autopilot accident. But since then, the company has worked with Intel and BMW on plans to put autonomous cars on roads this year.\nThe race around self-driving tech just keeps getting more intense, across so many dimensions. From Intel\u2019s perspective, moving fast to win a beachhead in self-driving is critical \u2014 the company has to find its next big market after missing mobile, and Qualcomm and Nvidia are pushing just as hard into transportation.\nBut cars are just rolling computers right now \u2014 Tamara Warren reviewed the tech inside the 2017 Audi S3 in our latest installment of Screendrive. Audi\u2019s stuff looks great to me, but it\u2019s still all so complicated \u2014 as Tamara notes, many of the functions require an instructional video to figure out.\n\nMUSIC WARS\n\n\nMicah Singleton reviewed Pandora Premium today; the $10/month streaming service launches on the 15th. As these streaming services all start to offer basically the same catalogs, it\u2019ll be things like exclusives, interfaces, and ecosystems that distinguish them. And right now I don\u2019t think Pandora\u2019s nice Rdio-influenced app can stand up to the massive Spotify ecosystem or Apple\u2019s exclusives. But we\u2019ll see.\nAnd Spotify is doing neat tricks, like only offering access to certain songs if it\u2019s raining as part of a promotion. That kind of cultural moment-making is hard to compete with.\n\nSXSW MOVIES\n\nLike I said, the tech side of SXSW is pretty sleepy \u2014 I\u2019ve had more conversations about what Apple may or may not do with the Mac than about anything new at the conference, but the TV and film side seems incredibly strong. Like Edgar Wright\u2019s Baby Driver, which Bryan Bishop says is terrific.\nBryan also watched three clips of Alien: Covenant at Ridley Scott\u2019s panel, and that seems like a welcome return to form after Prometheus.\n\nMegan Farokhmaneh watched I Know You From Somewhere, a short film about what it\u2019s like to be targeted by an internet mob. I\u2019m very interested in how filmmakers are thinking about how to portray the rhythms and emotions of social media; it makes something that can actually feel very lonely a part of an shared experience.\nI don\u2019t really even know what to say about American Gods, except that it seems completely nutty and incredibly interesting.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nI love this bonkers iPhone case that contains an entire Android phone. The Kickstarter video is so stupid, and make absolutely zero case for such thing happening, but whatever. Insane ideas are the most fun.\nYet putting an entire Android phone into the Vinci headphones always seemed like a confusing idea, but Dieter sums it up perfectly after playing with them today: \u201cWe should not begrudge them their gadget.\u201d\nI also love this Levi\u2019s smart jacket with Google\u2019s Project Jacquard tech built-in. It\u2019s $350 and it just got delayed from this spring to the fall, but Nick Statt really liked it, and I\u2019m a sucker for jackets anyway.\n\n"}
