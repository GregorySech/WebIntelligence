{"title": "Samsung is now selling virtual reality using an ostrich in a Gear VR", "content": " \nSamsung just concluded its Unpacked event and it was light on virtual reality news, but the company is making up for it with a Gear VR ad that\u2019s... quite odd. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to watch the video above, the joke is that an ostrich (which, you may recall, is a flightless bird) puts on a Gear VR headset and launches a flight simulator inside it, after which said ostrich is literally able (I think?) to begin soaring above its bemused companions. \u201cWe make what can\u2019t be made, so you can do what can\u2019t be done,\u201d reads the tagline, which would also be a decent slogan for Aperture Science.\n\n\nRead more about the Galaxy S8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the smoke clears: inside Samsung\u2019s quest for redemption\nHands-on video, photos, and impressions of the S8 and S8 Plus\nSamsung Galaxy S8 price will start at $720 \u2014 here's how to buy\nSamsung's Galaxy S8 can turn into a PC with its DeX dock\nGalaxy S8 announcement: all of the news from Samsung\u2019s launch event\n\n\nI could point out a various pedantic things about this video, like the fact that ostriches are probably unable to reach the Gear VR\u2019s trackpad, or genuinely important ones, like the fact that we do VR a disservice by suggesting it\u2019s interchangeable with real-world experience. But I\u2019m too busy trying to figure out what that ostrich is seeing.\nSee, the Gear VR and similar headsets are built for creatures with front-facing eyes and binocular vision \u2014 the screen shows a separate image to each eye, putting wearers into a 3D world. Many birds have eyes on the side of their head, which, as far as I understand, trades this depth perception for a very wide field of view.\nSo what happens if you try to trick a bird\u2019s super-wide-angle eyes with two overlapping images that are fairly close together? Would a real bird VR headset look like this joke concept from 2014? Would you just tilt a normal one so it fit squarely over one eye, simulating the experience of a one-eyed human in VR? Where does ostrich vision even fit on the bird-vision spectrum? Am I going to end up emailing an ornithologist to ask about bird VR for the sake of a throwaway two-minute commercial? Why are you torturing me like this, Samsung?\n"}
