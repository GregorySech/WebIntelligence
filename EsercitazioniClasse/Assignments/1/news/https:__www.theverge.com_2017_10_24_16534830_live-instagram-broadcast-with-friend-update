{"title": "You can now go live on Instagram with a friend", "content": " \nFollowing a test this past summer, Instagram is now letting users broadcast live with a friend. Users can invite anyone who's currently watching their broadcast to join, although only two people can broadcast simultaneously, which is visualized through a split screen. The owner of the broadcast can remove their guest and add someone else whenever they want. \nThe actual stories will look different in Instagram's feed, too. Instead of a single live circle, you'll see two circles stacked on top of each other. The update should be live in both the App Store and the Google Play Store today.\n"}
