{"title": "How to master Google Photos", "content": " \nBy now, you\u2019ve almost certainly heard how good Google Photos is. Your friends, family, and coworkers are probably using it and singing the app\u2019s praises. It makes backing up your photo library effortless. It can identify people \u2014 even babies \u2014 in your images with freakish accuracy. It automatically creates GIFs and movies that the people in your life will cherish. Hooray.\nBut there\u2019s really no great manual or user guide for Google Photos. Google\u2019s FAQ site is about as close as the company comes to a \u201cgetting started\u201d handbook. So I\u2019ve compiled some how-tos and tips here and plan to update this article to keep up with any big changes that Google makes to the app. \nMOVING TO GOOGLE PHOTOS\nFew tasks feel as daunting as transferring your entire photo library from one service to another. And few things feel worse than accidentally losing images or videos that you can\u2019t replace. So as great as Google Photos might be, switching to it won\u2019t be a small undertaking for everyone. \nApple Photos: If all of your pictures and videos are on your phone or Mac, this should be relatively straightforward. Just install Google Photos app on your iPhone or the desktop app for your Mac. On iOS, Photos will automatically start backing up your photo library. On Mac, you\u2019ll need to point it to the folder where your photos are stored.\nThere\u2019s just one potential snag to be aware of if you\u2019re using Apple\u2019s iCloud Photo Library. Depending on your settings, some of your images could be in the cloud and visible on your devices \u2014 but not actually stored on them. This might be the case if you got tired of warnings about low storage on your phone and decided to buy more space with iCloud. If you\u2019re using iCloud Photo Library, Google Photos might be unable to see or upload your photos and videos. The easiest solution is to make sure every file is actually saved on your smartphone or computer. To do that, just enable the options below:  \n\niOS: Settings > [your name at the top of the screen] > iCloud > PhotosSelect \u201cDownload and Keep Originals\u201d \nMac: Open Photos app. Choose Photos > PreferencesSelect \u201cDownload Originals to this Mac\u201d\nWindows: Apple explains how to download iCloud photos to your PC here. \n\nFlickr: Glenn Fleishmann put together a thorough step-by-step guide at Macworld for relocating from Flickr to Google Photos. I wish I could say it\u2019s a quick, easy process, but that\u2019s not the case. It takes some work to bring everything over \u2014 especially if you want to save things like image titles, descriptions, and other details that some photographers will insist on preserving.\nGlenn goes the manual route using Flickr\u2019s own export process, which is sure to test your patience since it involves downloading multiple, large zip archives of your entire Flickr library to a PC or Mac. You might be able to find third-party apps that can assist with that arduous step. Pictogo is one I\u2019ve had some success with on macOS. Once you\u2019ve got all the files, using the Google Photos desktop app to send them to their new home in the cloud is the easy part. Thankfully, Google Photos makes it painless to edit critical data for photos (ie. when they were taken) in case some of that gets lost during the move. \nMy best advice is this: tough it out. Don\u2019t let the distressing procedure make you abandon the entire mission. You\u2019ll only have to do this once. Endure the grunt work and be done with it.  \nWindows / Mac: If you\u2019re got a traditional photo library (folders upon folders), the Google Photos desktop uploader should get the job done fairly well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vlad Savov / The Verge\n\n\nCHOOSE WHAT TO BACK UP, WHEN, AND AT WHAT QUALITY\nGoogle Photos automatically backs up the pictures and videos you capture with your smartphone. When you first set up the app, you\u2019ll be given two choices on backup quality: optimized or original. Optimized is an enticing choice since it offers unlimited storage for free. And it\u2019s a fine option if you plan on sharing your images mostly online \u2014 via email, on social media, etc. \nBut if you\u2019re a semi-serious photographer, potentially see yourself making a photo book, or just want to archive everything without any quality degradation, it\u2019s best to pick \u201coriginal.\u201d However, original backups will eat into your Google account storage, so you\u2019ll likely need to upgrade at some point to get more room in the cloud for your library. By default, Google accounts come with 15GB of storage.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe backup options in Google Photos are pretty flexible. \n\n\n\nGoogle Photos gives you plenty of flexibility about when backups occur. You can tell the app to only back up over Wi-Fi if you need to be careful about using too much data on your phone. Google Photos can also be set to only do backups while your phone is being charged to minimize any battery drainage. Personally, I\u2019ve configured Photos to back up pictures at any time with cellular data but to wait for Wi-Fi for video uploads. \nSometimes you might need Google Photos to back up more than just camera roll items, though. You can choose which folders \u2014 screenshots, downloads, Instagram, etc. \u2014 Photos backs up by going to settings, then \u201cBack up & sync,\u201d and then select \u201cBack up device folders\u201d to toggle folders on and off. \nIf you want to back up an individual photo or video that\u2019s in a folder not  being synced with Google Photos, you can just do it manually. Open the image, tap the three-dot menu button in the top right, and choose \u201cBack up now.\u201d You can select multiple items when doing manual backups, as well. \nTHE HELPFUL, AUTOMATIC ASSISTANT\nOne of the best aspects of Google Photos is how much work it does for you automatically \u2014 without you doing a thing. Did you take a weekend trip somewhere? Photos will recognize that those pictures were taken in a specific location and create an album grouping them all together. If you took a sequence of similar images (even if they\u2019re not technically \u201cburst\u201d shots), Photos will often make an animated GIF out of them. It\u2019ll also create movies (with a music track), collages, and filtered versions of your shots. Again, this all happens with no work on your part. \nThese automatic creations show up in the Assistant tab, where you\u2019re free to either save them to your library permanently or swipe them away if Google made something bad. And yes, sometimes there are misfires. Movies are often imperfect when an algorithm is doing the editing, and Google really tends to layer on the effects thick when it randomly applies a filter to one of your photos. And just like with Facebook, on some days you\u2019ll open Photos and be greeted with photos of an ex or other delicate memories thanks to the  \u201cRediscover this day\u201d feature. \nBut more often than not, the Assistant produces really great stuff that\u2019ll cause you a quick burst of emotion. And whether they\u2019re rooted in joy, nostalgia, or wistfulness, those surprises get very addicting. \nHow to hide someone in Google Photos:\n\nTap the search bar\nExpand the section with faces of people in your library\nTap and hold on the person you don\u2019t want to see\nSelect \u201cHide\u201d in the upper right corner\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, Google Photos will avoid surfacing photos featuring that person in \u201cRediscover this day.\u201d\nSEARCH IS THE KILLER FEATURE\nIf you want to sell someone on Google Photos, show them the app\u2019s search powers. You can do the basics like \u201cselfie\u201d or \u201cphotos from last weekend.\u201d But the wow factor really hits when you search for specific subjects that Google Photos has identified in each of your shots. From individual people in your life to animals, objects, events (\u201cconcerts\u201d) and nearby landmarks, Photos can pull up whatever you\u2019re looking for in a massive library with astonishing speed. Occasionally some odd and not-quite-right results will appear with the good ones, but search is usually far more accurate than not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also ask search to show specific types of content within your library like GIFs, 360-degree photos, screenshots, and videos. \nMAKE YOUR OWN GIFS\nYou\u2019re not just limited to the GIFs that Google Photos automatically makes. The app also lets you create them with any photos you\u2019d like. Select the sequence of images you want, tap the + icon, choose animation, and you\u2019re done. You can string together any photos in your library that you\u2019d like, which allows for a little more creativity than a GIF of burst-shot photos. \nOR MAKE MOVIES FOR YOUR PARENTS\nGIFs might be popular among your friends, but your parents and other family members might appreciate the movies feature of Google Photos a little more. They like that stuff. To have the app automatically create a movie, select any images and videos you want to include, tap the plus button, and pick movie. Movies can only be created with the Google Photos mobile app; you can\u2019t yet make them from the web.\nFrom there, you can either just go with whatever Google makes or take control and edit things yourself. To change up the style and transitions, tap the clapperboard icon at the lower left of your screen. To switch up the music track, tap the music note. And if you want to adjust the order of content in the movie \u2014 or add or drop images \u2014 choose the film strip. Once you\u2019re done, you can either share your movie directly or upload it to YouTube for public viewing. \nSHARED ALBUMS\nIf you want to share your shots from a wedding or a party with other people that attended, Google Photos makes this relatively simple. Select the album that you want to share, tap the share icon, and start entering their name or email address. You can also create a new \u201cShared Album\u201d and choose whether or not people you share it with will be allowed to contribute to the album.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone you\u2019re sharing with is already a Google Photos user, you\u2019ll see the app\u2019s icon on that person\u2019s profile image. In this case, you can choose to share via Google Photos and  they\u2019ll receive an in-app notification. Otherwise, you can just simply share by email. Recipients must have a Google account to add their own images and videos to a shared album, but anyone with the link can view the album and download photos \u2014 even if they\u2019re not in Google\u2019s ecosystem. In that sense, it\u2019s worth using a bit of care with the shared album link. There\u2019s no way to assign different permissions to specific people you\u2019re sharing with. You can block someone\u2019s Google account to revoke access to any shared album. Next to the person's name, tap \u201cMore\u201d and then hit the block option.  \nFREE UP STORAGE ON YOUR PHONE\nAs Google uploads your phone\u2019s camera roll to the cloud, you might want to erase the copies of those images on your device to free up space. Photos makes this fairly simple: \n\nOpen the side menu\nSelect \u201cFree up space\u201d\nGoogle Photos will know what content has already been backed up and is safe to clear off of your device. Just tap the \u201cremove\u201d button to take the final step. \n\n\nFOLDERS! TURN ON THE PHOTOS FOLDER IN GOOGLE DRIVE\nIf for whatever reason you want or need to dig through the actual folder and file structure of Google Photos, you can do this through Google Drive. Go to Drive, then settings, then check the \u201cCreate a Google Photos folder\u201d option and you get... folders. Like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARCHIVE THE UGLY STUFF\nGoogle recently added an \u201carchive\u201d feature to Photos. This removes images from the main view of all your photos \u2014 but they\u2019re still accessible in the Archive folder. Photos will suggest some stuff to archive (like screenshots) but you can use archive for more... sensitive content as well. \nSATURATE YOUR SKIES\nThe built-in editing tools in Google Photos are perfectly adequate if you\u2019re making basic touchups. And if nothing else, hitting the \u201cAuto\u201d filter usually does a very nice job of improving the white balance of your image. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Photos editor\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a way to pump up the blues in your sky photos \u2014 without ratcheting up the saturation of the entire scene. Tap the pencil / edit button, choose the middle icon of setting sliders, and then expand the \u201ccolor\u201d section. There, you\u2019ll see a slider for \u201cdeep blue.\u201d Move that up, and your sky photography will get a a lot more pop. You can also use it for other blue subjects, as well. \nOther random tips and tricks:\n\nYou can change the look and density of your library as it appears on your phone\u2019s screen with a pinching gesture. Pinching in will increase the number of images shown on screen at once until you get to a month / year view, while pinching outward will zoom in to display just a few photos at a time \u2014 but much larger. \nFor the mobile app: if you know when a photo you\u2019re looking for was taken, it\u2019s much faster to use the scrubber on the right side (that appears as you scroll) to navigate your library. Once you grab it and scroll either up or down, you\u2019ll see the month and year pop up next to your finger so you know when to stop. \nYou can tell Google Photos to automatically strip out the location data from images and videos that you share with a link. Go to settings and toggle on \u201cRemove geo location.\u201d Google notes that this doesn\u2019t remove geolocation data for photos and videos that you share \u201cby other means\u201d in the app. \nGoogle Photos is the best cloud photo service going today, but if you\u2019re not a fan of giving Google so much of your data, it\u2019s relatively easy to bail on the whole thing. Just go to Google Takeout and you can choose to download your entire photo collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I plan to update this How-to over time as Google introduces or changes Photos features. If you\u2019ve got any questions (or if there\u2019s something you\u2019re dying for Google to add), I\u2019d love to hear about all of it in the comments. \n"}
