{"title": "Guillermo del Toro takes on the Cold War in the final trailer for The Shape of Water", "content": " \nGuillermo del Toro went on Facebook earlier today to answer questions about his upcoming film The Shape of Water, and then surprised audiences by unveiling the film\u2019s final trailer.\nThe Shape of Water is a film set in the 1950s that follows a mute woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who mops up floors at a facility that\u2019s housing a strange aquatic creature. Michael Shannon plays Strickland, a man tasked with keeping an eye on the beast, who believes it is dangerous and not to be trusted. Elisa soon bonds with the creature, however, leading to a surprising relationship between the two. The film premiered earlier this year at the Toronto International Film Festival, where we found it to be a beautiful film, filled with del Toro\u2019s own unique sentimentality. \nWe\u2019ve seen a few trailers for The Shape of Water so far, but this latest spot highlights the Cold War setting, and how government agents in charge of the mysterious facility are desperate to keep the aquatic creature away from the Russians. Not only do they have to contend with studying their prisoner, they have to keep an eye out for Russian spies and double agents. \nThe Shape of Water is coming to theaters on December 8th.\n"}
