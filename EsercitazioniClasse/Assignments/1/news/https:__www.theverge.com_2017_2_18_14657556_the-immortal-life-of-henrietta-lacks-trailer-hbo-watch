{"title": "Watch the first trailer for HBO\u2019s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks", "content": " \nHBO has released the first teaser for its upcoming film The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\nThe story of Henrietta Lacks was documented in Rebecca Skloot\u2019s 2010 book of the same title, which explores the story behind Henrietta Lacks and the immortal cell line that is derived from samples taken from her. Directed by George C. Wolfe, the film stars Oprah Winfrey as Henrietta Lack\u2019s daughter, Deborah, Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry as Henrietta Lacks, and Rose Byrne as Rebecca Skloot. \nIn 1951, Lacks had a biopsy taken from her cervix after giving birth. During treatment of a malignant epidermoid carcinoma, her doctors took two samples \u2014 one of cancerous cells, and the other healthy \u2014 without her knowledge. The cancerous cells became the basis of an immortal cell line known as HeLa, which have been used across the world for medical research. Lacks died at the age of 31 in 1951, but it wasn\u2019t until decades later that her children and other family members became aware of the use of her cells. \nSkloot\u2019s book earned considerable acclaim for exploring the story behind the HeLa immortal cell line, but also the ethics behind medical research and the racial impact that it had on the Lacks family. \nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks will be released on April 22nd on HBO. \n"}
