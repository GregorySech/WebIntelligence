{"title": "Why Zynga is getting behind Messenger games", "content": " \nZynga made its name by being one of the first to capitalize on Facebook as a gaming platform, and now the company is hoping to do the same for messenger apps. Today sees the launch of Words with Friends on Facebook Instant Games, one of the biggest titles so far to hit the relatively new Messenger-based gaming platform. The launch follows the release of a handful of smaller Messenger titles from Zynga, as well as GIFs Against Friends on Apple\u2019s iMessage.\nFor the developer, which has largely struggled to replicate its early Facebook success on mobile, these messaging platforms provide a new opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural platform for Words with Friends to be on,\u201d says Vaibhav Sahgal, GM of the Words with Friends franchise at Zynga.\nWords with Friends is launching alongside the global rollout of Instant Games; Facebook says that starting today Messenger games will be rolling out \u201cover the next few weeks worldwide for both iOS and Android.\u201d It\u2019ll be the first turn-based game on the platform \u2014 previously titles were primarily score-driven single-player experiences, like Pac-Man \u2014 and while it\u2019s largely the same as the mobile versions of the game, the new Words with Friends has also been adapted to better fit Messenger.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one thing, the game board is smaller to encourage faster matches, and it also utilizes Messenger bots to remind players when it\u2019s time to take their turn. But aside from a few tweaks the experience on each platform is very similar. The mobile versions of Word With Friends already include a built-in chat feature; on Messenger the roles are simply reversed. \u201cThese messaging platforms kind of flip that around in a very cool way,\u201d says Sahgal.\nFor Zynga as a company, Messenger and iMessage represent a potentially large new opportunity. As Facebook games have declined in popularity, so, too, have the company\u2019s fortunes. Zynga has tried multiple strategies for breaking through on mobile: new versions of games like FarmVille, acquiring successful mobile studios like NaturalMotion, and creating titles like Empires & Allies for a more traditional gaming audience.\nWhile some have proven successful, messaging platforms represent a chance to get in early on a nascent platform, much like the company did when it released FarmVille on Facebook in 2009. And just like back then, part of that involves figuring out just what kinds of games work on the platform. \u201cI think the games that are going to be the best on Messenger are not necessarily going to be the best elsewhere,\u201d says Mark Kantor, who is leading Zynga\u2019s new foray into messaging platforms. \u201cWord With Friends is maybe an exception to that, because it\u2019s a turn-based and inherently social game.\u201d\nThe potential audience for these games is huge \u2014 currently 1.2 billion people use Messenger. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the service will take off as a gaming platform. The audience for messenger-based games is still unproven, and as of now there is currently no way to actually monetize these games. So whether or not it will actually become a viable, self-sustaining platform remains unclear. In a statement Facebook said, \u201cWe are laying the groundwork with Words with Friends and other titles coming soon to give players a wider variety of gameplay options to further enhance their gaming experience.\u201d\nBut for Zynga, the hope is that by getting on the platform early, and learning what works and what doesn\u2019t, the studio will be in prime position if games on Messenger and iMessage \u2014 and possibly other services like Line \u2014 do eventually take off. \u201cWe\u2019re in that learning phase right now,\u201d says Sahgal.\n"}
