{"title": "Play the first hour of Prey in this new demo", "content": " \nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to Prey, the space-bound horror shooter from Dishonored studio Arkane, for quite some time now. It\u2019s not out until May 5th, but publisher Bethesda Softworks has released the first hour of the game as a demo for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. (The game is coming out on PC as well, but sadly, the demo is billed as \u201cconsole-exclusive.\u201d)\nMy colleague Bryan Bishop wrote some spoiler-light impressions of the game\u2019s beginning, in which protagonist Morgan Yu discovers strange happenings aboard a retro-futuristic space station called Talos I. I\u2019ve only gotten to try a later section of the game so far, but I did manage to confirm that you can eventually play as a roll of toilet paper. Have fun!\n\n"}
