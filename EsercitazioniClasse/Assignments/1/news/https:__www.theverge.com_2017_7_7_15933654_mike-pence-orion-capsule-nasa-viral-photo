{"title": "What was Mike Pence touching at NASA and is it okay?", "content": " \nIt\u2019s unusual for NASA to go viral, but that\u2019s what happened this morning: it was hard to avoid a photo of Vice President Mike Pence appearing to make first contact with a piece of NASA equipment \u2014 that apparently wasn\u2019t supposed to be touched. It looks to be a covering for the Orion capsule, which NASA is building to take humans into deep space. Fortunately, touching it probably won\u2019t mess up future missions.\nHere\u2019s the back story on the photo: yesterday, Pence visited NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, where he gave a speech declaring that President Trump will make the space agency great again (but didn\u2019t say how he\u2019d do it). Pence then toured the campus facilities and stopped in the Orion clean room, where pieces of NASA\u2019s capsule are being assembled. During this tour, Pence decided to place his hand on a piece of Orion spaceflight hardware \u2014 despite the fact that there was a sign attached to the article that read \u201cDO NOT TOUCH.\u201d\nA photographer was on hand to snap the picture, and the internet was on hand to make the jokes.\n\n\nWhen the sign says \"Do Not Touch\" but the VP is handsy. pic.twitter.com/uTlmsSRg7c\u2014 Robert McNees (@mcnees) July 7, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n pic.twitter.com/OFZJwRoFUi\u2014 Gotham_Knowledge (@GothamKnowledge) July 7, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/XM6mSl45Pe\u2014 darth:\u2122 (@darth) July 7, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pence's defense, \"DO NOT TOUCH\" is in quotes. pic.twitter.com/E6AXhxICnn\u2014 southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) July 7, 2017\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg, though. You can check out a whole inspired collection here.\nSo what exactly is Pence touching? One source who works on Orion tells The Verge that the vice president is touching the titanium forward bay cover of the Orion capsule, which is exactly what it sounds like: the thing that goes over the forward bay. That\u2019s on top of the capsule where the parachutes and other important hardware are kept. The forward bay cover is meant to keep this hardware safe from extreme environments during the mission to space. It is then jettisoned before landing just before the parachutes are deployed. Check out a test of this process below:\n\nAnd while it\u2019s probably best to respect the signs you see in a clean room, touching the cover doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal. NASA later confirmed what The Verge had already reported in a statement, that the \u201cdo not touch\u201d signs are there just to minimize handling of the hardware. \"Procedures require the hardware to be cleaned before tiles are bonded to the spacecraft, so touching the surface is okay,\u201d NASA said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cOtherwise, the hardware would have had a protective cover over it like the thermal heat shield, which was nearby.\"\nUpdate July 7th, 3:45PM ET: This post has been updated to include a statement from NASA. Pence has since blamed this on peer pressure.\n\n\nSorry @NASA...@MarcoRubio dared me to do it! pic.twitter.com/qIYtKOPyFh\u2014 Vice President Pence (@VP) July 7, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
