{"title": "How virtual reality developers are surviving the hype cycle", "content": " \nToday, Oculus kicks off its fourth annual Connect developers conference, where the Facebook-owned company will set the tone for virtual reality development in 2018. Connect will be capping off what\u2019s arguably been the quietest year for virtual reality since the original Rift development kit shipped in 2013. After the first series of big-name headsets were released in 2016, VR\u2019s immediate post-launch buzz is long gone. But to developers who are still building for the medium, that doesn\u2019t mean VR is over \u2014 just that they\u2019ve got a long way to go before hitting the mainstream.\nWhile we don\u2019t know exactly how many VR headsets each major platform has sold overall, it\u2019s estimated to be somewhere in the multimillion range. The Gear VR has shipped over 5 million units, PlayStation VR sold 1 million headsets by mid-2017, and Google\u2019s Daydream app has been installed on at least 1 million phones (though that doesn\u2019t directly translate to headset sales). Analysts estimated that Oculus Rift and HTC Vive sales each numbered in the hundreds of thousands as of earlier this year, although sources have said Oculus\u2019 summer sales put it closer to a million units. An analysis of Steam virtual reality game sales by VR developer Tristan Parrish Moore also suggests a nascent market there, with a few big VR-optional titles and a lot of games with between 1,000 and 50,000 owners \u2014 a tiny number compared to broader PC sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Band VR, Harmonix\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t surprise developers. I talked to over a dozen people creating VR interactive experiences who were still bullish on their chosen field, but who acknowledged that it would take years, and possibly another generation of hardware, for it to approach mass adoption. They cited a combination of cost, inconvenience, and a shortage of good content on all platforms. \u201cWe were not expecting that VR would fully arrive this year or last year. We think it\u2019s going to take a couple more years,\u201d says Harmonix CEO Steve Janiak, whose studio is behind Rock Band VR, Harmonix Music VR, and VR karaoke game SingSpace. \u201cBut it\u2019s such a transformative technology and the kinds of experiences you can deliver are so unique in VR that I find it difficult to think that it won\u2019t catch on eventually.\u201d\n\u201cI find it difficult to think that it won\u2019t catch on eventually.\u201d\nThe people I spoke to saw their work on VR as a future investment or a side project, not a major source of funding, for the near term. Harmonix, for instance, was able to make Rock Band VR with support from Oculus, which has published several of the best-known VR games. \u201cRelative to the install base, I\u2019m pretty happy with how Rock Band VR has performed\u201d on the Rift, says Janiak. But it\u2019s still a tiny game compared with the core Rock Band entries. Similarly, Otherside Entertainment, which is currently working on the non-VR title System Shock 3, released its VR game Underworld Overlord with support from Google.\nSome major publishers have gotten involved in VR, including Ubisoft, which has released three VR titles \u2014 Eagle Flight, Werewolves Within, and Star Trek: Bridge Crew \u2014 for various platforms. Ubisoft VP of partnerships Chris Early didn\u2019t say whether any of the company\u2019s games have broken even, but characterized its work as \u201cdefinitely an investment.\u201d On a smaller scale, you\u2019ll also find VR games from indie studios like Tequila Works, which released the interactive mystery Invisible Hours yesterday for Vive, PlayStation VR, and Oculus Rift. But the studio is better known for non-VR games Rime and Deadlight, and CEO Raul Rubio says the company isn\u2019t thinking about sales. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, nobody expects to sell half a million copies of a VR title,\u201d he says.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t run a studio focused on virtual reality, or make money off VR games. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible to be profitable making VR games right now, but you have to scope both your team and application size properly,\u201d says Nick Whiting, technical director of virtual and augmented reality at Epic Games. \u201cIf you go too big, you can\u2019t recoup your cost with today\u2019s install base. If you go too small, the content isn\u2019t compelling enough to sell to a large enough customer base.\u201d Whiting says the sweet spot is around 10 people working for a year; if they cover enough platforms to get a sizable market, or branch out into industrial and business VR, \u201cthere\u2019s hope.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data, Survios\n\n\nAt least one studio has gone significantly beyond that: Survios, creator of cooperative VR shooter Raw Data. Survios has a team of around 80 people and focuses entirely on virtual reality, which co-founder and chief creative officer James Iliff calls \u201cthe ultimate entertainment medium.\u201d Raw Data was a (relatively) high-selling HTC Vive game, and Survios has parlayed its success into strong relationships with investors: in December, it completed a $50 million funding round that Road to VR wrote made it the top-funded purely VR-focused development studio. Since then, it\u2019s focused on bringing Raw Data to other home VR platforms, including PlayStation VR later this month, and expanding to public arcades.\n\u201cYou sell a ticket, and people understand that.\u201d\nThis move outside the home is increasingly common, whether in the form of arcades or larger, more theme park-like installations. Utah startup The Void has partnered with Sony Pictures Entertainment and ILMxLAB to create \u201chyper-reality\u201d experiences based respectively on Ghostbusters and Star Wars, blending VR headset graphics with physical sets and effects. Location-based entertainment is particularly attractive to film companies like Sony Pictures, which control big franchises that have appeal independent of VR. Yesterday, the company expanded an existing deal with immersive media company Reality One, and will be releasing an experience based on its upcoming film Jumanji for VRX Networks\u2019 public VR kiosks.\n\u201cOne of the reasons that I think location-based VR is quite important right now is because the business model\u2019s quite straightforward,\u201d says ILMxLAB marketing and PR head Elizabeth Walker. \u201cYou sell a ticket, and people understand that.\u201d You don\u2019t need to convince people to buy a headset, and experiences can be fairly short, compared to a home VR game. But location-based VR comes with its own set of challenges, particularly once the initial novelty of an experience fades.\nMoving off the headset, though, is usually the easiest choice. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is one of the most successful and critically acclaimed VR titles, but Steel Crate Games co-founder Ben Kane suspects that on Steam, the game\u2019s biggest platform, far more people are playing the non-VR version than the VR one. \u201cI'd be surprised if it wasn't at least ten to one,\u201d he says. Similarly, Rubio says Tequila Works is interested in releasing a non-VR version of Invisible Hours, so more people could experience the story. As mobile augmented reality grows with platforms like Apple\u2019s ARKit and Google\u2019s ARCore, some developers are also adapting VR experiences for phone-based AR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Invisible Hours, Tequila Works\n\n\nThe early trend of adding VR support to first-person games has largely ebbed, since walking with a keyboard or analog stick in VR tends to induce nausea. But for games that have already included it, there does seem to be some crossover appeal. Myst spiritual sequel Obduction offers a VR option, and Cyan CEO Rand Miller says that a small contingent of \u201cavid VR players\u201d play close to 75 percent of the game \u2014 which can take 20 to 30 hours to beat \u2014 in a headset. Others choose to split their time between screens and headsets, depending on whether they\u2019re trying to solve a puzzle or simply looking around the world.\nAll this points a way forward for VR creators, but it also creates an incentive to avoid exploring VR\u2019s wilder possibilities, in favor of making something that can be safely ported to another platform. Lucky\u2019s Tale developer Playful Corp, for instance, focuses explicitly on big-budget games that work both inside and outside a headset, avoiding specialized control systems like Oculus Touch. Its latest game, the upcoming platformer Star Child, is made for both PlayStation VR and flat screens. \u201cAs a creator, I very much believe in the power of fully embracing a new technology or platform and creating things that could only exist on that platform. But now\u2019s not the time to do that for VR,\u201d says CEO Paul Bettner.\n\u201cI very much believe in the power of fully embracing a new technology ... Now\u2019s not the time to do that for VR.\u201d\nWhat could change this? Beyond simple price drops, we might need to see VR headsets that are easier to set up, like the Windows Mixed Reality headsets that are supposed to ship to consumers this holiday season. Wireless, self-contained headsets are another step, as long as they can provide an experience that\u2019s comparable to existing tethered devices. But really, nobody knows where VR is headed, or how big it will end up being.\nSurvios, Harmonix, and Ubisoft all have VR titles lined up for the coming year, and ILMxLAB and Sony Pictures are both committed to releasing home-based VR experiences as well as location-based ones. Otherside is interested in building more experiences on an \u201copportunistic\u201d basis, if the right idea appears. Few people, though, seem clear on when studios might break even on VR-only titles. For now, the goal is weathering VR\u2019s long slow period, ready to come out of the gate with good games when more people start buying headsets.\nWhiting dismissed what he called the \u201cdoomsday\u201d predictions about virtual reality. \u201cMany are saying the VR fad is dead because we didn\u2019t reach the astronomically high initial projections of a few hyped speculators,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the boots-on-the-ground members of the industry have more measured expectations. \u2026 People still believe in the medium, and they\u2019re finding viable areas of the industry in which to earn money. As long as that trend continues, I think we\u2019ll be in a good place.\u201d But \u201cbelief\u201d has been a key word in VR for years now \u2014 and if 2017 was any indication, it might still be for years to come.\n"}
