{"title": "Stranger Things\u2019 spoiler tweets reveal the nightmare future of marketing", "content": " \nRemember in Minority Report, when Tom Cruise\u2019s character tries to lose some pursuers in a crowded mall, but the sophisticated advertising technology of 2054 keeps identifying him by name and trying to sell him things? It\u2019s a funny gag, and a useful plot point, since it means he can\u2019t go anywhere without wall-holograms ratting him out to his enemies. But it\u2019s also meant to be the sign of a dark future dystopia, where privacy has disappeared, and facial-recognition scanners and complicated algorithms target consumers individually.\nThe team behind the hit Netflix series Stranger Things has been taking us a step closer to that dark future lately, with a series of short Twitter \u201cspoiler\u201d videos aimed at calling out prominent individual fans of the show, and giving them tidbits about the next season. These micro-ads offer tailored reveals for single sources, like Nerdist\u2019s Chris Hardwick:\n\n\nHey @hardwick. Since you're not a mouthbreather, @milliebbrown has a special spoiler for you. pic.twitter.com/dxe7lMA6JU\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 5, 2017\n\n\n\nOr The Last Fall director Matthew A. Cherry:\n\n\nWe don't know if you're Team Steve, @MatthewACherry, but we do know you're Team Stranger. So we got you a spoiler. pic.twitter.com/YNbe5u4G66\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 8, 2017\n\n\n\nOr former Onion writer and Modern Family producer Megan Ganz:\n\n\nDear @meganganz. Since you love us and we love you, we got @calebrmclaughl1 to send you a spoiler straight from The Upside Down. pic.twitter.com/BGb3Qk1O3u\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 15, 2017\n\n\n\nOr Teen Wolf\u2019s Max Carver:\n\n\nHey @maxcarver! Will Byers has a little something to tide you over until Stranger Things 2. pic.twitter.com/39uEnCuoSa\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 10, 2017\n\n\n\nSpoiler: the videos aren\u2019t actually particularly spoilery. The Chris Hardwick one basically just promises the show\u2019s second season, arriving October 27, will feature new 1980s slang. The latest video, aimed at Star Trek: The Next Generation veteran and all-around science fiction nerd idol Wil Wheaton, consists entirely of one of the series\u2019 creators holding up eight fingers. \n\n\nPssst, @wilw. The Duffer Brothers have a Stranger Things 2 spoiler. It's for you. pic.twitter.com/iFjrvDkn3J\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 18, 2017\n\n\n\nBut even if no one seeing these tweets needs to live through the nightmare of having the show spoiled for them, they still might feel like they\u2019re moving closer to some kind of dark dystopia. Between Google ads watching our email and targeting marketing accordingly, and browsers remembering every site we visit and urging us to go back, we may already feel like the internet is coming to get us personally, and demand we buy, support, and watch everything we\u2019ve ever shown any interest in. Advertising is coming to get us, and this time it\u2019s personal.\nExcept that the Netflix marketing team misspelled Wil Wheaton\u2019s name in his special branded video. At least we have the relief of knowing our future ultra-targeted personal marketing still probably won\u2019t know us as well as it thinks it does.\n\nEdited October 18, 2017 to add: The marketing team did eventually figure out they\u2019d misspelled Wheaton\u2019s last name, and pulled the video and the tweet, though you can see the original text in the screencap on this post. Here\u2019s the reposted version, with the proper number of H\u2019s in his name, and some extra ones in the tweet by way of apology. Still dystopian, tho!\n\n\nWhe Lhove Yhou @wilw. Sorry we were mouthbreathers. We hope you\u2019ll still accept this spoiler with your real name on it. pic.twitter.com/eC7EAf1kyq\u2014 Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) October 18, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
