{"title": "HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley addresses the dark underbelly of artificial intelligence", "content": " \nSilicon Valley is Mike Judge and Alec Berg\u2019s biting comedy about the American tech industry, now in its fourth season. Every week, we\u2019ll be taking one idea, scene, or joke and explain how it ties to the real Silicon Valley and speaks to an issue at the heart of the industry and its ever-lasting goal to change the world \u2014 and make boatloads of money in the process.\nSpoilers ahead for the fourth episode of season 4, \u201cTeambuilding Exercise.\u201d\nIn the fictional tech industry of HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley, the soul-crushing mundanity of grunt work is often treated as a punchline. Like many sitcoms about careerism and the slog of American professional life, it\u2019s considered an insult to have to do boring, seemingly meaningless tasks just because some higher power demands it. But on last night\u2019s episode, Silicon Valley highlighted a rather pernicious aspect of the tech industry that\u2019s currently serving as the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, shining a spotlight on a type of human labor often overlooked when we discuss the marvels of automation. \nIn \u201cTeambuilding Excercise,\u201d we have Erlich scrambling to transform his \u201cShazam for food\u201d idea into a workable app, in order to keep the venture capital money flowing. He has Jian-Yang cook up a working prototype of SeeFood, as it\u2019s so appropriately called, but the test app is capable only of identifying whether a certain food is or is not a hot dog. As is the case with most Silicon Valley gags, there\u2019s an elaborate dick joke here. (In a clever twist, HBO commissioned a developer to turn the prototype into a real mobile app you can download right now, if you live in the US.) \nAI relies on humans making sense of data\nRunning out of time and in need of some massive data crunching to expand SeeFood beyond hot dogs, Erlich convinces newly minted Stanford guest lecturer Big Head to let him assign an introductory computer science class with the task of categorizing pictures of food off the internet. It ultimately backfires on Erlich, as the students decide to launch a SeeFood rival of their own. But the task he assigned the class is a very real and illustrative type of tech industry labor, not unlike the work of the Mumbai clickfarm Jared employed last season to boost Pied Piper\u2019s user metrics. \nBecause many modern AI advancements are thanks to neural networks, and because those networks must be trained with countless examples so they improve over time, companies often need human beings to help the software make sense of the data. That\u2019s especially true of computer vision, where computers are digesting images as a series of 1s and 0s and must be trained to understand what it\u2019s actually looking at. But it\u2019s also quite common in the realm of chatbots, where text exchanges are reviewed after the fact and then cataloged based on how well the software answered a question or performed a task. \n\nYou could call the workers that perform these tasks AI trainers or data annotators, but those roles tend to inflate the importance of the work and downplay its grueling nature. Ultimately, what it comes down to is human beings stepping in when a chatbot or AI program needs assistance, or tirelessly reviewing an algorithm\u2019s decision-making and cataloging its mistakes to ensure it improves over time. Think of it like a specific extension of Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk marketplace, where human beings are regularly tasked with performing feats computers are not yet capable of doing for tiny fees. \nA number of AI startups have popped up over the last few years, as the field has become one of the most sought-after technologies in the industry. Nearly every single one relies on human labor, often secured through short-term contract agreements, to make the reality of the service or software match both the lofty expectations of its creator and the confused expectations of users. \nStartups like Magic rely on cheap labor from the Philippines\nTake, for example, the startup Magic, which debuted in 2015 as an on-demand concierge service that let you make virtually any request via SMS, so long as it\u2019s legal. Magic launched its service, which once cost $100 per hour and now costs $35, by employing scores of contractors in the Philippines, where human labor is far cheaper than in the US. The company\u2019s long-term goal is to build AI that can automate away some of the more rote behaviors and routine demands, while humans would increasingly be used only for tasks the software could never perform on its own, like calling Amazon customer service. Yet for now that means having a team of around 150 people, dubbed \u201cmagicians,\u201d who are essentially treated like virtual robot butlers by a clientele of mostly wealthy Bay Area types. \nOther startups aren\u2019t quite as dependent on human labor just to operate, but rely on it nonetheless to make sure the data coming in is instructive. X.ai, which developed an email assistant that helps schedule and manage appointment in your inbox, uses human trainers to review and correct exchanges the bot has with strangers. That way, it sounds less robotic and more natural over time. \nFacebook also engages in this blend of software and human input with its M bot. Launched in beta in fall 2015, M acted like a fully automated personal assistant, but it requires a team of human contractors down in Menlo Park to take control of the bot when, say, someone asks it to call Amazon customer service. Because this model is near impossible to scale to Facebook\u2019s gargantuan user base, M won\u2019t likely exit its experimental testing stage anytime soon. Instead, the company has taken the learnings from M and turned them into features for the broader Messenger user base, starting with suggestions for M to perform tasks calling an Uber for you or picking out a sticker to reply with. \nWhile \u201cTeambuilding Exercise\u201d paints Erlich\u2019s request as the whims of a ludicrous con man, categorizing images of food on the internet not so different than annotating an email exchange or observing a stranger conversing with a Facebook chatbot about ordering a burrito. The work is arduous, boring, and \u2014 in the case of content moderators who scan social networks for violent or disturbing content \u2014 sometimes psychologically torturing. In the real Silicon Valley, you don\u2019t have to make college students do all this dirty work for school credit. You just need to hire someone as a contractor, with few strings attached, and task them with making the AI of the future smarter and better. Hopefully one day, our phones just might be capable of recognizing more than hot dogs. \n\n"}
