{"title": "The case for Android Oreo", "content": " \nGoogle is expected to soon announce more details on version 8.0 of Android, which we know to be codenamed Android O. But the biggest question about Android O \u2014 more so than what new features it will bring to the mobile OS or if Google will be able to actually get carriers and hardware companies to offer the update to older phones \u2014 remains unanswered: what is Android O going to be called?\nWhat is Android O going to be called?\nIf the usual naming scheme that Google has used for the last few years holds true, will be some kind of confectionery-themed name beginning with the letter O.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual history of Android version logos, Cupcake through Nougat.\n\n\nTo recap, so far we\u2019ve had:\n\nCupcake (Android 1.5)\nDonut (Android 1.6)\nEclair (Android 2.0)\nFroyo (Android 2.2)\nGingerbread (Android 2.3)\nHoneycomb (Android 3.0)\nIce Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0)\nJelly Bean (Android 4.1)\nKitKat (Android 4.4)\nLollipop (Android 5.0)\nMarshmallow (Android 6.0)\nNougat (Android 7.0)\n\nYes, the numbering scheme was weird for a while. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s better now. But much like Android N before it, there\u2019s a distinct paucity of good dessert foods that start with O. After putting our crack team of researchers and dessert experts on it, we\u2019ve narrowed the possibilities down to three distinct options:\nAndroid Oatmeal / Oatmeal Cookie / Oatmeal Raisin \nOatmeal is not really a dessert food, but oatmeal cookies or oatmeal raisin cookies are close enough. Pros in favor of Android Oatmeal Cookie: it\u2019s a well-known food, it fits our primarily candy / pastry theme pretty well, and doesn\u2019t require paying branding fees to someone (see below). Cons are that oatmeal cookies are an inferior cookie that are almost universally looked down upon as the \u201cbad\u201d cookie option that you eat when you\u2019re trying to pretend to be healthy or because all the chocolate chip cookies are gone. Being associated with the world\u2019s most boring dessert probably isn\u2019t ideal.\nAndroid Orange Sherbert / Orange Sorbet / Orange Popsicle\nThis subset covers pretty much anything that starts with the flavor and / or color modifier \u201corange.\u201d While this will work for the naming scheme, it feels like cheating. Also, as seen by Android Ice Cream Sandwich, Google seems to shy away from straight freezer foods, going as far as making Android 4.0 have an awkwardly long name just to get some variety in there. Seems pretty unlikely, but Google could have a surprise up its sleeve.\nAndroid Oreo \nAh yes. The Mega Stuf-sized elephant in the room, Android Oreo seems like it would be the perfect name. Oreos are probably the most beloved cookie in the world, with popular cultural cachet through a lightning-quick social media strategy and an ongoing cycle of fun, limited edition flavors. The biggest standing in the way of Android Oreo, though, is that it\u2019s a trademarked brand owned by Nabisco (i.e., Mondel\u0113z International, Nabisco\u2019s parent company) and Cadbury. Now, Android KitKat 4.4 has set precedent for branded versions of Android, in an interesting co-branding deal that saw no money change hands, yet allowed Google to use the popular chocolate bar\u2019s name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle even teamed up to create a small run of custom, edible KitKat Android robots, although those weren\u2019t actually sold to consumers. It\u2019s entirely possible that Google could arrange a similar deal to license the Oreo name \u2014 and with Oreo\u2019s penchant for themed cookies, who knows? Maybe edible Android Oreos could exist, too. \nAdding fuel to the fire is a recent collaboration between Oreo and Google earlier this year in February to produce the Oreo Space Dunk Challenge, which uses Google Maps to allow users to virtually dunk an Oreo into a glass of milk from space. So there is a precedent for a Google and Oreo team up, one which almost certainly coincidentally occurred just a month before the Android O developer release. Right around the same time that the Oreo Space Dunk Challenge occurred, Android SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted this image to known Oreo connoisseur and Verge reporter Dan Seifert, which some take as proof that Android Oreo will be the name.\n\n\n@dcseifert pic.twitter.com/u8nMzjTIO1\u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) February 20, 2017\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible we won\u2019t get a name for O at Google I/O this year. Google has historically tended to wait until later in the summer for name reveals, and last year the company simply punted on the issue entirely and opened up a public forum for the internet to submit their best ideas before settling on Nougat. \nThere is one final option: Google calls an audible and changes direction for the naming scheme entirely. Apple used to name macOS versions after big cats until it shifted to its new mountain / park / landmark in California system. Actually, come to think of it, big cats are free for operating system names right now. \nAndroid Ocelot. It could happen. \n\n"}
