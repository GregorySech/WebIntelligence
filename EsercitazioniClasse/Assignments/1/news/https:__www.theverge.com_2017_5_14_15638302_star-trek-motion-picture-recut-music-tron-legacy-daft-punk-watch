{"title": "Watch Star Trek: The Motion Picture recut with the music from Tron: Legacy", "content": " \nStar Trek and Tron aren\u2019t two things that typically go together, but filmmaker Patrick Collins recently mashed the pair together in a short film called Star Trek: Legacy. In this 22-minute film, he recut Star Trek: The Motion Picture and set it to Daft Punk\u2019s fantastic score from Tron: Legacy. The resulting film works better than it sounds on paper, and makes for a really cool viewing experience. \nCollins noted that he wanted to give the original film a bit more of an updated feel, while maintaining the \u201cpacing and staging of the original.\u201d The two films share some thematic similarities, in that they\u2019re both about people being uploaded into computers. As a result, the introduction of Tron\u2019s music doesn\u2019t feel enormously out of place, and even like a natural fit. \nChanging up the music can change the entire tone and feel of a film\nDaft Punk\u2019s score is the best thing to come out of Tron: Legacy, and while it\u2019s a far cry from Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s music, Collins\u2019 edit mashes the music together with the visuals perfectly. The music drones as the Enterprise swoops across the screen or and soars during the film\u2019s big action sequences. The result is a film that\u2019s somewhere between an elaborate music video, or a particularly trippy Star Trek episode, but either way, it makes for a cool short film. \nWe\u2019ve seen examples how changing up a film\u2019s score can really change the tone of the film, such as with a recent Rogue One fan edit called Rogue One: The Battle of Scarif, which reintroduced John Williams\u2019 classic score to the movie. This edit wasn\u2019t trying to fix its original film, but the results are pretty similar. The changes reinterpret the film and impart an entirely different tone. It\u2019s a reimagining that could only come out of the massed creativity of fans on the internet, rather than a film studio. \n\n"}
