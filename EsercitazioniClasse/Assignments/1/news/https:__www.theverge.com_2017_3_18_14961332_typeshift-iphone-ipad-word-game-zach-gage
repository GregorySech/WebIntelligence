{"title": "TypeShift is a slick and beautiful new word game for iPhone", "content": " \nLeave it to Zach Gage to create yet another interesting experience in the well-trod field of word games. The game designer, who most recently crafted fascinating new spins on chess and solitaire, just released a word game called TypeShift on iOS. He describes it as \u201cthe modern anagram puzzle.\u201d Like most addictive games, it\u2019s seemingly simple, challenging you to create a number of five-letter words out of a jumble of letters. It\u2019s like a literary version of a combination lock \u2014 and it\u2019s very hard to put down.\nThe core of TypeShift is creating words. Each puzzle presents you with a grid of letters, divided into five columns. To make words you cycle through the letters in each column, moving them up and down just like if you were inputting a combination on a padlock, which feels perfectly intuitive on a touchscreen. When you do make a word, each letter will turn green, and the goal of each stage is to change the color of every letter in the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZach Gage\n\n\n\u201cThis could be perceived as an affront to chess.\u201d Zach Gage on designing Really Bad Chess\n\n\nThis structure makes TypeShift feel much looser and more playful compared to other word games (including Gage\u2019s own Spelltower from 2011). When I find myself stuck coming up with a word, I just mess around with the arrangement of letters, and eventually something will click in my brain. Often when I find one word, it leads to a deluge. It\u2019s also a great fit for mobile not only because of the touch controls, but because it\u2019s easy to drop a puzzle and pick it back up whenever. Sometimes that break is what you need to see what you\u2019ve been missing, and TypeShift is the rare game that works in both short bursts and prolonged sessions.\nWhile the game is free to download, new puzzle packs are available in bundles, ranging from 20 to 60 puzzles. And in addition to being able to purchase more challenging levels \u2014 some with more letters and words, others with fewer options \u2014 there are also crossword-like \u201cclue puzzles\u201d that provide vague hints at the words you can find. TypeShift also includes free daily puzzles that start out relatively easy on Monday, but get progressively more challenging throughout the week.\nTypeShift isn\u2019t fundamentally different from most word games; you\u2019re still creating words from a selection of letters. But its structure and playful nature makes it feel intrinsically mobile, a perfect game to pull out for a few minutes each day to unwind. You can check it out now on iOS.\n"}
