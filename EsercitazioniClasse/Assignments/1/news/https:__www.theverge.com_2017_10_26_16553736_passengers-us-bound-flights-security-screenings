{"title": "Passengers on US-bound flights now have to go through even more security screenings", "content": " \nNew security measures for all US-bound flights begin today, following the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \u201cfirst round\u201d of enhanced electronics screenings back in July. According to CNBC, these new measures include passenger questioning and searching carry-on bags. The new rules affect all 2,100 flights that come to the US daily, including US carriers. \nThere seems to be some confusion as airlines around the world gave various statements to CNBC about what the measures would entail and how they would be rolling out. In Dubai, Emirates has begun searching carry-on bags and questioning passengers about their luggage, trip origin, and liquids. Xiamen Airlines in China said they will only interview passengers that show a \u201ccertain degree of risk.\u201d Singapore Airlines\u2019 website says passengers may have to undergo security questioning during check-in and boarding.\" Some airlines have permission to delay implementing the additional protocols until January 2018.\nA passenger in Hong Kong traveling to Los Angeles shared with CNBC the types of questions they were asked. \"They asked me if I packed my own bag, where I packed it from, where I came from, they looked at my itinerary, verify where I was, who I was, from where I came from.\"\nThese additional measures, compounded with the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s recent electronics inspection mandate, are leading some airlines to suggest passengers plan for extra time at airports. Delta is telling those flying to the US to arrive at least three hours before departure time.\nJohn Kelly, the US secretary of Homeland Security, initially announced the stricter security practices in June, saying, \u201cI am concerned that we are seeing renewed interest on the part of terrorist groups to go after the aviation sector.\u201d\n"}
