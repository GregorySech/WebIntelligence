{"title": "Microsoft has created a Surface USB-C dongle for \u2018people who love dongles\u2019", "content": " \nMicrosoft\u2019s latest Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices don\u2019t ship with USB-C connections, and it\u2019s been a source of controversy for the company. \u201cI love the technology in Type-C, I believe in Type-C,\u201d explains Microsoft\u2019s Surface chief, Panos Panay, in an exclusive interview with The Verge. \"When Type-C is ready for our customers, to make it easy for them, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d While Panay isn\u2019t ready to add USB-C to Surface devices just yet, he thinks he has the answer: a dongle. \u201cIf you love Type-C, it means you love dongles,\u201d jokes Panay. \u201cWe\u2019re giving a dongle to people who love dongles.\u201d\nMicrosoft is planning to release a dongle that will plug into the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices and provide USB-C support. It\u2019s like any dongle you\u2019d expect, and it simply slots into the Surface connector port on the device. \u201cIf you want to charge a device with a Type-C charger, you can. If you want to put data back and forth with a Type-C peripheral, you can,\u201d says Panay.\nMicrosoft's Surface chief explains missing USB-C\nWhile Panay jokes about USB-C and the dongle problem, he has some serious answers as to why it\u2019s missing on both the new Surface Pro and Laptop. \u201cThe last thing I want is to take away the port they need today and tomorrow and the next day, to achieve a technology milestone where I then put a barrier in front of my customers,\u201d says Panay. \u201cA dongle or an adaptor or a cable that didn\u2019t work because it was Thunderbolt or wasn\u2019t Thunderbolt or I bought the wrong peripheral or I tried to charge it with my phone charger but it wasn\u2019t enough to charge my device all day. Those are those moments.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \nMicrosoft is placing a big bet on its new Surface family\n\nPanay claims Microsoft is trying to strike a balance, and this new USB-C dongle is an example of that. Microsoft hasn't always held back on adopting new charging methods for Surface devices. Microsoft switched out the Surface connector for a USB 2.0 charger in the Surface 3 so people could use their phone chargers to charge the tablet.  \u201cI learned a super valuable lesson with Surface 3,\u201d says Panay. \u201cWhat we learned very quickly, which was painful for me, was that it was true what we said: you can charge your device with a phone charger. The problem was that it would take 10 or 12 hours depending on how small the wattage is on the charger,\u201d explains Panay. \u201cThe challenge is when the customer calls you and says \u2018my product doesn\u2019t work, what did you do?\u2019\u201d\nMicrosoft could have switched the mini DisplayPort on the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop to USB-C, but Panay says that\u2019s simply \u201ctaking away another port that matters\" and could have generated similar complaints. This new dongle might be enough for those who want USB-C right now, but it's clear that the technology will only truly arrive on future Surface devices. Microsoft isn't providing an exact release date or pricing for its USB-C dongle, but the accessory will be available later this year.\n"}
