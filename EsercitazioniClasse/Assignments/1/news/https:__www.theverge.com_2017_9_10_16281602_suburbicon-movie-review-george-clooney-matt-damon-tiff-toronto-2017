{"title": "George Clooney\u2019s Suburbicon is an indictment of white privilege wrapped in a Coens crime comedy", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review was originally posted from the Toronto International Film Festival, and has been reposted to coincide with the film\u2019s broad theatrical release.\nAs a director, George Clooney has a track record of making films that are exceptionally crafted, even if they haven\u2019t all ended up being great at the end of the day. Movies like Good Night, and Good Luck and The Ides of March demonstrate his impressive skills as a storyteller, while other efforts like Leatherheads and The Monuments Men have fumbled their attempts at comedy and action. But his latest film, Suburbicon, seems as close as you can get to a sure-fire cinematic success: a script that originated with Joel and Ethan Coen, a cast that includes Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, and Oscar Isaac, and a darkly comedic tone that seems right in line with Clooney\u2019s own sensibilities.\nBut Clooney has never minced words about his political views, and he uses Suburbicon to step into the larger discussion about racism, and to chip away at the stubborn romanticization of 1950s America. Set in a suburb named Suburbicon, the film is at first glance about idyllic people living idyllic lives. But those perfectly manicured lawns and cheery neighborhood greetings are ultimately just a cover for the deceptions and evils hiding within. \nSuburbicon is at its best when it locks into a familiar groove and delivers on one of its many Coen-esque movie moments. The original script was written by the Coen brothers back in the 1980s, and that DNA shines through with every tongue-in-cheek setup and comedic misdirect. But it\u2019s a scattered film, making too many vital points at once. By neglecting to bring them together into one single story, Clooney undercuts them all.\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nIt\u2019s a comedic crime thriller \u2014 though one that briefly masquerades as a drama just to get the ball rolling. Those familiar with the Coen brothers\u2019 1996 classic Fargo will find it immediately recognizable; it\u2019s just set in 1950s suburbia. \nWhat\u2019s it about?\nMoronic criminals committing moronic crimes. It starts with Matt Damon\u2019s Gardner Lodge, a father in a 1950s-catalog community called Suburbicon. It\u2019s a seemingly American utopia, full of identical homes, broad laws, and smiling families. But one night, two men break into Gardner\u2019s home and tie up his son Nicky (Noah Jupe), his wife (Julianne Moore), and his wife\u2019s identical twin sister Margaret (also Julianne Moore). Gardner\u2019s wife is killed during the break-in, and in the aftermath, he tries to put his life back together with Margaret\u2019s help. But Nicky suspects something odd is going on, and soon enough, the police get involved and a suburban conspiracy begins to slowly unravel.\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\nSurburbicon is most literally about how the fabled \u201850s heyday of white America \u2014 the same one a certain political campaign thought would help make America great again \u2014 is an abject lie, a veneer that hid depravity, cruelty, and corruption. That\u2019s not a particularly new idea, but Clooney also focuses heavily on race relations as a core part of that lie. Suburbicon is a proud all-white community, and when a black family moves into the neighborhood, the residents take immediate action. They sign petitions trying to drive the Meyers family out, they charge Mrs. Meyers ridiculous mark-ups at the grocery store, and they show up nightly outside the family\u2019s home to chant and jeer them into submission. It\u2019s a horrible display, and there isn\u2019t much subtlety in Clooney\u2019s point: this is an indictment of modern-day America, and he\u2019s not interested in hiding it.\nIs it good?\nClooney does a wonderful job in simply adopting the tone and style of the Coens\u2019 filmography. At times, his film comes off like a cover song \u2014 it has all the hallmarks of a familiar, beloved hit, even if it\u2019s not the same. The individual moments often work, largely because of the cast Clooney\u2019s assembled. Damon is clearly having a lot of fun subverting his Ordinary American Guy persona, and Julianne Moore is impeccable as always. But Oscar Isaac is the most memorable, turning a couple of scenes as a shady insurance investigator into two of the most delightful (and gory) sequences in the film. \nBut Suburbicon fails to hold together, in large part because it never treats the Meyers family as actual characters. Clooney uses them as an springboard for moments of bigotry and horror, even though they never impact the tongue-in-cheek core story of Gardner and his family. The closest Suburbicon gets is a passing friendship between Nicky and the Meyers\u2019 son, Andy. Andy explains that his father told him the best way to face down virulent racial hatred is to never show any weakness, but that\u2019s really the only insight Clooney offers into what the Meyers are experiencing, and how they feel about it. What should be a vital story comes across as an afterthought, at best. At worst, it plays like Suburbicon is using the Meyers family as props, failing to to give them the same kind of depth or screen time it gives its two-bit thugs, or Nicky\u2019s wacky uncle.\nThat isn\u2019t a condemnation of Suburbicon\u2019s intentions. Mainstream art-forms have a unique opportunity to contribute to the public discourse around social issues, and Clooney doesn\u2019t hesitate to share his point of view on racism, hypocrisy, or self-serving justifications for both. But the film should also strive to go beyond mere tokenism. Earlier this year, Get Out demonstrated just how effective storytelling can be in conveying different points of views and perspectives. In the wake of that movie\u2019s success, it\u2019s hard to not see Suburbicon\u2019s scattered execution as a tremendous missed opportunity.\nWhat should it be rated?\nFireplace-poker violence? Check. Poisonings? Check. Racial epithets? Check. General bad-people-doing-bad-things stuff? Check. Comedic tendencies or not, this one deserves an R.\nHow can I actually watch it?\nSuburbicon arrives in American theaters on October 27th.\n"}
