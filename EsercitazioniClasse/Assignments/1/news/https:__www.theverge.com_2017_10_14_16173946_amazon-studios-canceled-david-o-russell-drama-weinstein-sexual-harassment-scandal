{"content": " Following a pair of reports detailing decades of sexual harassment and abuse by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, Amazon Studios has cut ties with the his studio and has canceled a high-profile television drama from David O. Russell, according to the Los Angeles Times.The studio ordered two seasons of the Silver Linings Playbook director\u2019s untitled project, which was set to star Robert De Niro, Julianne Moore, and Michael Shannon. Russell, De Niro, and Moore released a statement yesterday saying that they supported Amazon\u2019s decision to cancel the show. The move comes with a high cost: the project was reportedly budgeted at $160 million for both seasons. Weinstein was an executive producer on the project, which was reportedly a mafia crime series set in the 1990s. The studio is moving forward with a Weinstein co-production from Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, The Romanoffs, but without the support of the beleaguered company. The studio made the move after it announced that it suspended its studio head, Roy Price, who helped produce a string of critically acclaimed dramas for the online retailer, such as The Man in the High Castle and Transparent. Since the reports of its co-founder\u2019s allegations surfaced, the Weinstein Company has faced considerable fallout from the industry. The studio is delaying the release of an upcoming film, The Current War, until sometime in 2018, but has denied that it is looking into putting itself up for sale or simply shutting down.
