{"title": "The science behind a perfectly-toasted marshmallow", "content": " \nWilderness is nice, but hands down, the number one reason to go camping is to incinerate food over a fiery pit. Everything tastes better when it\u2019s burned over flames, especially marshmallows. But before you dip your \u2018mallow-tipped toasting fork in the campfire, here are a few things you should know: \nMarshmallows are sugary gas bags\nMarshmallows are mainly sugar, but air actually makes up more than half their volume. They\u2019re made by beating together gelatin or another gel-forming ingredient with a hot sugary syrup. Beating the mixture creates air bubbles, which become trapped as the liquid mixture cools into a gel \u2014 creating the spongy texture.\nThose bubbles are why Peeps explode in the microwave, and flaming marshmallows swell on the end of a toasting fork. Hotter temperatures makes the air trapped inside the marshmallow expand and take up more space, forcing the flexible sugary mixture to stretch. Eventually, if the pressure is too much? Kaboom. \nBut take the marshmallow out of the heat, and it\u2019ll deflate \u2014 although the stretched out gelatin doesn\u2019t bounce back. \u201cIt shrinks to a shriveled mass,\u201d Richard Hartel, a food scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tells The Verge in an email. \u201cDon't get me started on Peeps jousting.\u201d\n\nThe best marshmallow is a burnt marshmallow\nWell, maybe not burnt \u2014 but definitely toasted. Heating the marshmallow over the fire can make the sugar caramelize, a chemical reaction that produces the brown color and toasted flavor. It requires really high temperatures, so microwaving your marshmallow isn\u2019t going to cut it. \n\u201cMany foods don't get hot enough when they cook for caramelization (like bread),\u201d food chemistry professor Matt Hartings at American University tells The Verge in an email. \u201cMarshmallows certainly do over a fire.\u201d  \nWhen the sugar gets hot enough, it starts to break down into smaller molecules that then react with one another. These reactions produce new fruity, nutty, and buttery flavors you can taste and smell on your toasted marshmallow. They also turn the marshmallow skin that satisfying golden color. \nCertain sugars may also react with amino acids in the gelatin in what\u2019s known as the Maillard reaction. It occurs at much lower temperatures than caramelization and contributes to the rich brown color and complex flavors of a seared steak, roasted coffee, or caramel candies. For marshmallows that are very slowly roasted, Hartel suspects that the Maillard reaction might be what\u2019s producing their golden hue and general deliciousness.\n\n\nMaximal goo requires patience \nMarshmallows start to melt when they heat up to just above body temperature, Hartings says. But if you\u2019re not careful, you can completely burn the outside before the inside even gets warm. The heat of the fire shakes loose the chemical bonds in the gelatin that hold the candy together, which makes the marshmallow ooze.\nSo, whether you prefer marshmallows golden brown or charbroiled, don\u2019t catch them on fire immediately if you want to maximize the gooeyness. \u201cYou've gotta be patient and slow for a while (letting the meltiness reach all the way to the insides). Then,\u201d Hartings says, \u201cyou can torch the sucker.\u201d\n"}
