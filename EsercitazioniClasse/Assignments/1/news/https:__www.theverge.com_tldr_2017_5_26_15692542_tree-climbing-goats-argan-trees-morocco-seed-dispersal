This way of disseminating seeds might actually be more common than scientists have previously thought, according to a new study.\nFirst off, let\u2019s talk about the Moroccan goats. Because these aren\u2019t your normal, pasture-grazing goats. These animals climb on top of trees that measure 26 to 33 feet high to graze. That\u2019s because southwestern Morocco, where the argan tree grows, doesn\u2019t get a lot of rain \u2014 so sometimes, the only food the goats can find is on top of evergreen shrubs and trees. In the fall, these tree-climbing goats devote more than 70 percent of their eating time to \u201ctreetop grazing.\u201d (This over-harvesting can actually hurt the trees.)\nLet\u2019s talk about the argan trees, because these aren\u2019t your normal, pretty trees, either. Their seeds are used to produce argan oil \u2014 which is the most expensive edible oil in the world and is included in luxurious beauty products. The tree-climbing goats love the pulpy fruit of the argan tree, but there\u2019s some debate about how they get rid of its seeds. The study published this month in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment wanted to set the record straight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some arid habitats, such as argan forests, most green vegetation is on the tops of trees and goats climb there to feed.\nPhoto by J Rom\u00e1n / EBD-CSIC\n\n\nPopular accounts \u2014 reported in various news outlets \u2014 say that locals feed the argan fruits to the goats so that the animals can get rid of the pulp for them. Then, the seeds are collected from the goats\u2019 poop to make the precious oil. However, the authors of today\u2019s study say, goats don\u2019t usually poop large seeds. (The argan seed, at about 0.86 inches in length and 0.6 inches in width, is considered large.) So the researchers began wondering: what if the goats aren\u2019t pooping the seeds, but spitting them out? (The regurgitated seeds and feces \u201care usually mixed, resulting in misunderstandings about the way the nuts were expelled,\u201d the study says.)\nGoats are ruminants, meaning they re-chew their food after leaving it in a specialized stomach to ferment. Goats in Spain have been observed spitting the seeds of olive trees and dwarf palms while re-chewing their food. So why not the Moroccan goats?\nTo find out, the researchers fed domestic goats fruits of different sizes from five plant species. The goats spat out seeds from each species, and did so more frequently when the seeds were larger. More than 70 percent of the discarded seeds were still viable, the study says. That means that when the goats spit out the argan seeds as they go about their day, they help the tree disperse its seeds far away from the mother plant. \nThis type of seed dispersal isn\u2019t limited to goats, the study says. The authors say that they have observed other ruminants like sheep and deer do this as well in southern Spain. And, they suggest, it might be more common than we thought.\nAs for the tree-climbing goats of Morocco and the argan trees, if you use beauty products with argan oil, I hope you\u2019re not grossed out about the goat spit. It\u2019s better than poop anyway, right?\n"}
