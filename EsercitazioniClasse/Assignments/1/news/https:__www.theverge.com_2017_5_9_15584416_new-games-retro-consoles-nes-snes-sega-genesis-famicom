{"title": "These are the developers creating new games for old consoles", "content": " \nIf you want to play Dustin Long\u2019s most recent game, you\u2019ll need a console that was first released more than 30 years ago. As a young musician in New York, Long found himself drawn to the chiptune scene, where artists craft sounds using classic gaming hardware. He would go to shows like Blip Festival and Pulsewave, where he saw artists coaxing music from old Game Boys and a Sega Genesis. But he went a step further and decided to design a game that could only be played on an obsolete console. \u201cSeeing their work made a huge impression on me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt inspired me to create something of my own, as a way to contribute back.\u201d In 2014 he released Star Versus, an 8-bit space shooter that was only available to purchase on an NES cartridge.\nLong isn\u2019t alone. Over the last few years a number of game developers, both hobbyists and professionals, have crafted brand-new games that you can only play on old hardware. Several are coming later this year. September will see the launch of cyberpunk beat \u2018em up Paprium on the Sega Genesis, while vampire-themed fighter Unholy Night: The Darkness Hunter is expected to release on the SNES in June. They follow the likes of recently released Kira Kira Star Night DX and 8-bit Music Power, released for the Famicom \u2014 the Japanese version of the NES released in 1983.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomebrew games are essentially unlicensed titles designed with the limitations of a particular console in mind. For some, it\u2019s a hobby, a fun way to experiment with programming and design techniques. For others, it\u2019s a way to pay homage to game experiences that have long gone out of fashion. Sometimes it\u2019s a little of both. In 2010 Xbox co-founder Ed Fries created a stripped-down version of Halo designed for the Atari 2600, while Paul Koller has made a name porting modern indie games to the Commodore 64. Most of these games are released for free, and playable through an emulator on a PC.\nFor Long, the decision to not only create a retro homebrew game, but release it on a cartridge, was made because he wanted to embrace the limitations of a device like the NES. \u201cThe goal was to craft a tightly controlled experience,\u201d he explains. While Star Versus is a decidedly 8-bit game, as a competitive shooter it also pulls from modern game design techniques. Long was also interested in restricting himself to the NES controller, something that wouldn\u2019t be possible if people played the game through a PC emulator. \u201cThere were obvious downsides to only being on cartridge, such as limited exposure and difficulty in demoing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy with the choice I made, at least for this game.\u201d\nReleasing a title on 30-year-old hardware comes with more challenges than just a limited audience. (Star Versus has sold around 300 copies to date.) For one, there is the audience\u2019s expectations of what can be accomplished by a small team on a dated machine. \u201cOur fans expect something better than the AAA games of the time, where teams at the peak of their career were supported by multi-million dollar companies,\u201d explains pixel artist Gwenael Godde, founder of Paprium developer Watermelon Games. Because of this, the team spent a great deal of time researching the technical aspects of the hardware, like the optimal sizes for in-game characters, or the best way to make the screen scroll from scene-to-scene.\n\u201cTotally different games, totally different requirements.\u201d\nPaprium is actually the second Genesis game released by Watermelon, following the 2010 role-playing game Pier Solar and the Great Architects. Work on Pier Solar began in 2004, when it started as a small project among like-minded members of the Sega homebrew community. Eventually it expanded in scope to become a commercial project. Development took a lot longer than anticipated, thanks to a combination of the limited capabilities of Sega\u2019s 16-bit systems and the challenges inherent with a mostly volunteer-led project. Pier Solar was originally scheduled to launch in 2008, but didn\u2019t ship until two years later. Afterward, the team created a Kickstarter-funded \u201cHD\u201d version of the game, which launched on more modern platforms like the PS3, Wii U, and\u2026 the Sega Dreamcast.\nHowever, the many years spent creating Pier Solar didn\u2019t mean it was any easier developing the follow-up. \u201cNone of the tools or code used for Pier Solar have been re-used in Paprium,\u201d explains Godde. \u201cThe main reason is that, because of the hardware constraints, every single tool or code must be designed to be a perfect fit for the game. Totally different games, totally different requirements.\u201d\n\nTechnical constraints might be the biggest challenge of developing for these platforms. \u201cThe hardest part by far was having to juggle multiple kinds of restrictions simultaneously,\u201d explains Long. \u201cLimited processor speed, limited memory, and limited file sizes meant that fixing a problem in one area often caused issues somewhere else. The worst was during late development, where having an idea for a small fix or feature would often mean having to work around the system's limitations first to clear up memory or space to make room.\u201d\n\u201cThe NES was a nice sweet spot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also tough deciding what platform to develop on. Each console has its own quirks, whether it\u2019s hardware capabilities or the difficulties in producing new cartridges. Developers may also have a particular fondness for one console over another, depending on childhood experiences. For Long, who also looked at systems like the SNES and Atari 2600, the appeal of the NES was more practical than sentimental. For one, it was already popular among the homebrew community, which meant he could find help if he came up against a technical hurdle. It also had the power to create the game he had in mind, while still being simple enough that it wasn\u2019t especially daunting. \u201cThe NES was a nice sweet spot,\u201d he says.\nIn an age when you can buy 8-bit game soundtracks on vinyl and spend $449 on a high-end aluminum NES, the resurgence of cartridge games makes a certain kind of sense. For the creators, there are many unique challenges inherent to building these retro games. But, for the most part, these difficulties are offset by the satisfaction that comes from being able to play a game on a system they grew up with. \u201cWe are big Mega Drive fans,\u201d says Godde. \u201cThe 16-bit era is a good challenge for us.\u201d\n"}
