{"title": "After its 4chan slip-up, is it time for Google to drop Top Stories?", "content": " \nAfter yesterday\u2019s mass shooting in Las Vegas, Google briefly gave its \u201cTop Stories\u201d stamp of approval to two 4chan threads identifying (and triumphantly smearing) the wrong man as the shooter. Google apologized for including \u201cinaccurate\u201d web pages in its top results, saying that its algorithm had spotted a burst of activity around a little-used search term (the name of 4chan\u2019s so-called suspect), created a Top Stories carousel, and favored \u201cfresh\u201d content there above more authoritative sources.\nThis is far from the first time Google\u2019s search results have purveyed misinformation. In March, it finally instructed human quality raters \u2014 who manually evaluate web pages to train the Search algorithm \u2014 to flag offensive and factually incorrect material, which Search could then downgrade for users seeking general information about a topic. As the 4chan incident shows, though, it still has blind spots. And that\u2019s not really because of a problem with Google\u2019s algorithm. It\u2019s happening because Google\u2019s core business has never been about defining truth \u2014 yet that\u2019s what Top Stories is implicitly promising.\nA \u2018top story\u2019 really just sounds like a \u2018recent story\u2019\nGoogle publishes detailed guidelines for website quality ratings, where it outlines many ranking factors that include originality of content and \u201cexpertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\u201d But it won\u2019t go into detail about how various factors intersect, a crucial question that it says is too complicated to answer. Among other things, Google won\u2019t explain just what makes a \u201cTop Stories\u201d carousel appear for a particular search term, except that it uses a special set of signals to detect whether users might be interested in seeing fresh or \u201cbreaking\u201d links. Once the carousel appears, we don\u2019t know how its stories are chosen compared to Google\u2019s normal search results \u2014 except, again, that there\u2019s an added focus on freshness.\nI\u2019m sure there are complicated answers to these questions, but there are also basic principles that Google could publicly commit to following, if it wanted. Are Top Stories supposed to be held to higher than usual trustworthiness standards than average search results? Does the carousel only appear if there\u2019s a baseline general-interest newsworthiness, or is any internet micro-controversy supposed to trigger one? What is a \u201cTop Story\u201d even supposed to be?\n\u201cTop Stories\u201d has only been part of desktop Google Search since the end of 2016, when it replaced similar \u201cIn the News\u201d boxes. While the new name justifies a much broader and more flexible range of content, it leaves the overarching purpose unclear. If good Top Stories are defined by the same standards as good generic search results, they should just be the top-ranked links for a query. If the point is to showcase fresh content, they should be called something like \u201cRecent Stories.\u201d If they\u2019re the most high-quality and definitive results, Google needs to explain its standards \u2014 and why they\u2019re different from the larger ranking system.\nGoogle already has a curated News system, so why won\u2019t it use it?\nA Google spokesperson told us that Top Stories could be valuable for immediately presenting a range of different types of useful information on a search query, especially when it\u2019s newsworthy. But Google already has a News box, which sets search algorithms loose on a smaller list of approved sites. It seems easy to offer an expanded version of this with a larger list of general-purpose websites, exclude sites with low \u201cauthoritative\u201d rankings, or otherwise provide special guidance for these sections. Conversely, if Google can\u2019t define why \u201cTop Stories\u201d are special, then it might as well abolish them \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to give a few arcanely selected web pages special treatment.\nGoogle\u2019s original PageRank algorithm was built to deliver the most popular and influential results for any search query, whether or not the content was true or good in a more philosophical sense. It\u2019s gotten far more complex since then, but being the web\u2019s best directory is still very different from being its ultimate arbiter of quality. As it puts more and more focus on its AI assistant, Google wants to be both \u2014 but it refuses to acknowledge that they\u2019re different things, and that the tools that work for one might be bad for the other. As long as that\u2019s true, Top Stories will stay like it is now: a vaguely named, poorly defined system that conflates popularity with value.\n"}
