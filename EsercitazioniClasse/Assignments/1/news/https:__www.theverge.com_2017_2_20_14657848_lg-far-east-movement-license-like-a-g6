{"title": "LG hasn't licensed Like a G6 to launch the G6", "content": " \nLG is preparing to launch the G6, its next flagship smartphone, on Sunday, but so far it hasn\u2019t reached out to the group behind the 2009 smash hit \u201cLike a G6\u201d to license the seemingly synergy-heavy track. Far East Movement tells The Verge that it has not heard from LG about licensing the track, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2010, but noted \u201cthat would be cool.\u201d When we asked LG about this they requested the group\u2019s contact info, so there's still hope.\nThe fact that \u201cLike a G6\u201d was largely about being fly like a Gulfstream G650 jet and not fly like a smartphone shouldn\u2019t deter LG. If there was ever a situation to just go with something, this is it. \n\n"}
