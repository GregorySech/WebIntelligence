{"title": "iPhone 7S dummy model points to a glass back and wireless charging", "content": " \nApple could be switching things up, if a couple of purported iPhone dummy models are to be believed. 9to5Mac received a couple images from leak specialist Sonny Dickson that depict next iteration of iPhones with a glass backing, which could mean that the models could have inductive charging as a feature. \nApple is expected to announce three new iPhone models next month: the iPhone 8, which will be a major overhaul for the phone \u2014 and which might not arrive until 2018, as well as a refresh to the iPhone 7 models. \nWireless charging is already expected for the overhauled iPhone 8, and if accurate, it seems as though Apple could be bringing that feature to consumers a bit early: earlier this summer, a couple of Foxxconn employees claimed that the 7S model would have an aluminum unibody instead of a glass chassis and that they wouldn\u2019t have wireless charging. \n\n"}
