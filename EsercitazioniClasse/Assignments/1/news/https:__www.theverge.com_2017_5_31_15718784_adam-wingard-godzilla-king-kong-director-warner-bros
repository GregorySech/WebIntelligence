{"title": "Blair Witch\u2019s Adam Wingard will direct Godzilla vs. Kong", "content": " \nWarner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment\u2019s Godzilla vs. Kong, slated for a May 2020 release, has just named its director, Deadline reports. Adam Wingard, best known for his critically acclaimed indie horror breakthrough You\u2019re Next (2011), and more recently for Blair Witch (2016), a low-budget spinoff sequel to the 1999 found footage classic, will pick up his first monster movie. \nWingard also recently finished work on Netflix\u2019s Death Note, a live-action adaptation of the popular 2003 manga series, which will stream in August. The choice echoes the studio\u2019s hiring of Gareth Edwards, who made a name for himself with indie horror film Monsters, to direct 2014\u2019s Godzilla. The decision hints that Legendary\u2019s already gritty take on the monster movie will be getting even darker in installments to come.  \nGodzilla vs. Kong will be the fourth film in Warner Bros. / Legendary Entertainment\u2019s monster series, following 2014\u2019s Godzilla, this year\u2019s Kong: Skull Island, and Godzilla: King of the Monster in 2019. An unrelated TV show called King Kong Skull Island, written by The Bye Bye Man\u2019s Jonathan Penner and Stacy Title and produced by IM Global, is also coming soon. \nWingard has worked from scripts written by collaborator Simon Barrett on all of his best-known projects, but Godzilla vs. Kong has yet to announce a screenwriter. Legendary did announce an absurd roster of writers in March who would collaboratively storyboard the project and build out the future of the \u201cMonsterVerse\u201d franchise, pulling in Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne (Star Trek Beyond and Star Trek 4), Lindsey Beer (The Kingkiller Chronicles), Cat Vasko (Queen of the Air), T.S. Nowlin (Maze Runner, Pacific Rim: Uprising), Jack Paglen (Transcendence, Alien: Covenant), and J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5, World War Z, Sense8). As my colleague Andrew Liptak noted at the time, this practice isn\u2019t entirely uncommon anymore: there\u2019s a writers\u2019 group tasked with keeping all of the Star Wars storylines in order, and, somehow, another is responsible for remembering and guiding the various plots of the Transformers franchise. You can think of it as a TV writers\u2019 room, but for films that will make hundreds of millions of dollars no matter what. \n\n"}
