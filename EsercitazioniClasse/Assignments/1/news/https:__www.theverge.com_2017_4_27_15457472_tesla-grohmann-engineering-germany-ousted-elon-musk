{"title": "Tesla\u2019s German automation expert reportedly ousted after just six months", "content": " \nKlaus Grohmann, founder of the German firm Grohmann Engineering which specializes in automated manufacturing acquired by Tesla late last year, was just ousted after clashing with the electric carmaker\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, Reuters is reporting. \nGrohmann reportedly disagreed with Musk over how to handle his firm\u2019s legacy clients, according to the news wire, which included Tesla competitors like Daimler (parent company of Mercedes-Benz) and BMW. Musk wanted the German manufacturing facility to focus solely on building Tesla vehicles. \nIt was only six months ago that Tesla acquired Grohmann Engineering, with the firm\u2019s founder agreeing to head a new division within the automaker called Tesla Advanced Automation Germany. The acquisition was the linchpin in Tesla\u2019s plan to add an additional 1,000 engineering and technician jobs in Germany, on top of Grohmann\u2019s existing 700 employees, over the next two years. This was to happen parallel with the company\u2019s aggressive plans to ramp up electrical vehicle production at its Fremont, California, factory. Tesla has stated its goal is to produce 500,000 vehicles by 2018. \nBefore the acquisition, Grohmann worked with a number of other automotive manufacturers, as well as semiconductor and life science companies. At the time, Tesla said Grohmann would continue to work with outside clients, including those in the automotive industry. But over time, those directives apparently changed, leading to Grohmann\u2019s ousting. \nA spokesperson for Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson praised Grohmann Engineering as \u201can incredible company,\u201d and said Tesla\u2019s plans to expand its manufacturing operation in Germany would not be affected by his departure.  \n\n"}
