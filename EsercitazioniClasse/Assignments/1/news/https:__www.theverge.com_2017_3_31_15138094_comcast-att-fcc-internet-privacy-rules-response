{"title": "Comcast, AT&T;, and Verizon say you shouldn\u2019t worry about gutting of internet privacy rules", "content": " \nComcast, AT&T, and Verizon published blog posts this morning responding to the backlash they\u2019ve been receiving since Congress voted to revoke a strong set of internet privacy rules that would have prevented internet providers from using or sharing their customers\u2019 web browsing history without permission. The companies take different approaches when responding, but the takeaway from all three is that they think customers should stop worrying.\nComcast takes a friendlier approach and actually makes some basic commitments to customers. \u201cWe do not sell our broadband customers\u2019 individual web browsing history,\u201d writes Gerard Lewis, Comcast\u2019s chief privacy officer. \u201cWe did not do it before the FCC\u2019s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so.\u201d\n\u201cThe Congressional action had zero effect.\u201d\nOf course, \u201cno plans to do so,\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cwe will never do so,\u201d but Comcast is largely indicating here what we\u2019ve suspected: that people\u2019s worst fears \u2014 ISPs letting people buy their web history \u2014 isn\u2019t likely to happen for any number of reasons.\nComcast also says it will rework its privacy policy to \u201cmake more clear and prominent that ... we do not sell our customers\u2019 individual web browsing information to third parties and that we do not share sensitive information unless our customers have affirmatively opted in to allow that to occur.\u201d (Though note that, in this context, \u201csensitive\u201d information is limited to specific things, like health information and data on children.)\nThat\u2019s helpful. But Comcast isn\u2019t making commitments that\u2019ll make it easier for customers to protect their data from being used. The rest of its blog post largely consists of Lewis explaining the weaker privacy rules the FCC is now reverting to in terms that make them sound much tougher than they actually are. He does note, however, that Comcast offers an option for customers to opt out of seeing its targeted ads.\nVerizon\u2019s approach is similar. The company\u2019s chief privacy officer, Karen Zacharia, offers a fairly clear statement: \u201cVerizon does not sell the personal web browsing history of our customers,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t do it and that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\nZacharia also notes that Verizon actively gives customers a choice to participate in its ad programs that rely on web browsing data \u2014 that is, customers have to opt in, instead of opt out.\nVerizon says consumers will benefit by not having these privacy rules\nBut Zacharia also makes the same arguments about the removal of these privacy rules being good for consumers. \u201cConsumers benefit and innovations flourish when there is one consistent consumer privacy framework that applies to all internet companies and users in the internet ecosystem,\u201d she writes. \u201cThat is what Congress voted for this week.\u201d\nBut consumers don\u2019t sit around thinking about privacy frameworks \u2014 internet providers do. And the one that the US is returning to includes much more leeway for internet providers and, despite what they\u2019ll tell you, actually puts them at an advantage over companies like Facebook and Google when it comes to collecting data.\nAT&T\u2019s response has the same message at its core, but the tone couldn\u2019t be more different: it\u2019s standoffish and argumentative, with AT&T\u2019s public policy chief, Bob Quinn, trying to explain why nothing has changed and the FCC was wrong in the first place.\n\u201cThe Congressional action had zero effect on the privacy protections afforded to consumers,\u201d Quinn writes. \u201cIt is also flatly untrue that the Congressional action eliminated all legal protections governing use of consumer information.\u201d\nAT&T again complains that the privacy rules were unfair to internet providers\nMost of the post is spent complaining about the FCC\u2019s approach under Obama, and Quinn even gets a dig in at Title II reclassification, indicating that AT&T would like to see it reversed.\nSo what privacy rights does AT&T say its customers have? Quinn doesn\u2019t actually get into that in the blog post, aside from saying that existing statutes still offer them protection. That\u2019s true, to a point. But the existing statute is distinctly weaker than what the new rules would have offered. Like Comcast said, \u201csensitive\u201d information is still protected, but that only includes very specific categories of information.\nQuinn also points to AT&T\u2019s privacy policy, which he says was one of the first to \u201cmove away from\u201d looking \u201clike a legal document.\u201d That policy says that AT&T \u201cwill not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose.\u201d\nTrump has yet to sign the resolution reversing the FCC\u2019s privacy order, but he\u2019s expected to do so in the coming days. On Thursday, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said that killing the rules \u201cwill allow service providers to be treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns to be reviewed on an equal playing field.\u201d\nFor more on what the death of these privacy rules will and won\u2019t allow internet providers to do, you can read our story breaking down what it means for your privacy.\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.\nUpdate March 31st, 2:04PM ET: This story has been updated to include comments from Verizon.\n"}
