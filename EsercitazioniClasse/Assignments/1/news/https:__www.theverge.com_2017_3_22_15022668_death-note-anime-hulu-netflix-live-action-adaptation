{"title": "Before Netflix airs a Death Note film, watch the original show", "content": " \nDeath Note has been adapted from its manga origins into an anime, video games, a musical, and several Japanese live-action movies. Now it\u2019s getting the English-language film treatment via Netflix. The live-action adaptation will premiere on August 25th. If the teaser trailer released today looks puzzling or even a little cheesy to you, then let me give you this one nugget of advice: go watch the anime on Netflix or Hulu. \nUnlike Western teen-centric shows, which often focus on romance or petty drama, Death Note grapples with gray-area morality. It follows a high schooler named Light Yagami who stumbles across a notebook that can kill anyone whose name is written in it; he becomes a wielder of vigilante justice and starts using it to wipe out criminals. The idea of an angsty teenager being given the power to kill people he deems worthy of death would be morbidly funny if it weren\u2019t absolutely terrifying.\nThe anime spans 37 episodes, each running a little over 20 minutes each, in subbed or English dubbed versions. It\u2019s binge-friendly, but just as enjoyable when picked at here and there.\nI have no idea how Netflix\u2019s film adaptation will turn out. It has both Willem Dafoe and mopey Seattle teens, which cancel each other out on the scale of Good vs. Bad things. But I do feel confident that it can\u2019t possibly cover everything the anime does. It\u2019s a movie. Movies are short. Look, that\u2019s just math. \nThis story has been updated to include streaming options for Netflix and Hulu. \n"}
