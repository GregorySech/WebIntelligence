Put a hot dog in front of it, and it\u2019ll say \u201chotdog!\u201d Put something else, like a shoe instead, and it\u2019ll say \u201cnot hotdog!\u201d It\u2019s simple. A real version of the app showed up in the App Store after the episode aired. Today, it\u2019s available on Android through the Play Store. A bunch of knockoff apps are also listed, so make sure you\u2019re downloading the official version.\nPro tip: the app is good at identifying hot dog-themed items, too, like phone cases. \n\n\nBonus: it even works with the Not Hotdog app pic.twitter.com/6n3ox9LjMh\u2014 Matt Moore (@MattMoore2) June 18, 2017\n\n\n\nGo ahead and get out there, y\u2019all.
