{"title": "Sling TV\u2019s cloud DVR is now available on iOS", "content": " \nAfter rolling out its cloud DVR to numerous other platforms, Sling TV is today making the feature available on iOS. The latest version of Sling TV for iPhone and iPad adds the ability to record shows and movies on most channels that aren\u2019t owned by Disney. DVR is already available on Android, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, Xbox One, Windows 10, and other devices. \nSling\u2019s DVR \u201cFirst Look\u201d costs an extra $5 per month on top of your subscription and gets you 50 hours of cloud storage. If you use up that space, older recordings are automatically deleted to make room for new ones. When you choose to record an episode of a TV series, you\u2019ll get the option to record new episodes, just the one you\u2019ve chosen, or everything if you also want to save reruns. Recordings can be protected to prevent automatic deletion, as well. \nYou can set recordings from numerous areas of the Sling TV interface such as On Now and Guide. Unfortunately, iOS doesn\u2019t yet have the traditional grid-of-channels guide that Sling TV recently introduced on Android. That should make recording even more straightforward once available. \nThe list of Sling TV channels that don\u2019t presently allow DVR recording include: ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney JR, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN 3, ESPN Deportes, ESPN Goal Line, ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Bases Loaded and the SEC Network.\nAll of the major streaming TV services except for DirecTV Now offer some type of DVR feature. \n"}
