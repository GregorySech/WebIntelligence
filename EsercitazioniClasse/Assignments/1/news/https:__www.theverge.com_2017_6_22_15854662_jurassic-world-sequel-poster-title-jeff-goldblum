{"title": "The Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom poster is just a single nostalgic callback", "content": " \nThanks to a brand-new poster, we now know the title for the Jurassic World sequel: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. We have no idea what that means, though it may suggest that dinosaurs were royalty at some point? Who knows? Look, the new Transformers movie opens with a King Arthur battle. Literally anything can happen and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\nAnyway, I\u2019m more concerned with the movie\u2019s tagline: \u201cLife finds a way.\u201d The marketers and producers really want us to know that Jeff Goldblum is coming back.\n\n\nIn one year, life finds a way. pic.twitter.com/32Cu62xn1Y\u2014 Jurassic World (@JurassicWorld) June 22, 2017\n\n\n\nThe tagline is a callback to Dr. Ian Malcolm\u2019s meme-friendly line in the original Jurassic Park:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldblum, who skipped the past two Jurassic Park films, signed on to reprise his iconic sexy scientist role in the Jurassic World sequel back in April. He\u2019ll be joining Jurassic World stars Chris Pratt, Dallas Bryce Howard, and B.D. Wong in the film. A Monster Calls director J.A. Bayona is attached to direct.\nWe still don\u2019t know much about where this story will go, but producer Frank Marshall told SlashFilm that \u201cthe world has changed a lot since Ian Malcolm went to Jurassic Park and we need his point of view now more than ever.\u201d\nI wonder if that has anything to do with dinosaur poo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
