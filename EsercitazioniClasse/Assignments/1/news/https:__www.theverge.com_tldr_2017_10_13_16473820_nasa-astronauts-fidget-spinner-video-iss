{"title": "Astronauts film a fidget spinner trick video on the ISS", "content": " \nI could bore you with loads of pretense about viral internet trends, but I\u2019ve already wasted enough time in this lede sentence without telling you that astronauts aboard the International Space Station just dropped a fidget spinner trick video filmed in zero gravity. \nThe video, which you can watch above, features astronauts Mark T. Vande Hei, Joseph Acaba, Randy Bresnik, and Paolo Nespoli spinning a NASA-branded fidget spinner while also spinning themselves in the gravity-free environs of the ISS. (Daaads!) There are probably valuable basic physics lessons about friction and Newton\u2019s laws to be gleaned from what they\u2019re doing, but I honestly can\u2019t focus on them because my mind is too affected by the absolutely thumping royalty-free music NASA used for the video. \nAstronauts love dad joke stunts \u2014 Scott Kelly once chased his co-workers around the space lab in a gorilla suit just months after filming a video of himself in a Mike Myers mask \u2014 so it\u2019s no surprise that a fidget spinner found its way to the ISS. Kelly\u2019s even spoken to us about how stuff like this helps lighten the mood on the cramped space station, so this certainly won\u2019t be the last. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do next, but I\u2019d definitely love to watch them try to find a way to make the water bottle flip work.\n\n\nOur son is finally (just a little) impressed with what his mom & dad & their colleagues do. Thanks, @AstroKomrade!   https://t.co/Bh09O2cbH5\u2014 Karen L. Nyberg (@AstroKarenN) October 13, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
