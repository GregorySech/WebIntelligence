{"title": "Amazon is discounting Kindle models by up to $50", "content": " \nIt\u2019s never a bad time to buy into e-books. So if you\u2019ve always contemplated picking up a Kindle and happen to have Prime, Amazon has a good incentive to do so now with $30 to $50 discounts on nearly its entire e-reader line. \nThe Kindle Paperwhite is now just $90, down $30 from its standard price of $120. The standard Kindle is also $30 off, bringing its price down to $50. And the Kindle Voyage, which is almost never discounted, is now $150 after a $50 discount. As Kinja Deals points out, these offers are even better than the Black Friday ones Amazon put out. \nThe one model left out here is the Kindle Oasis, Amazon\u2019s higher-end e-reader that comes with months-long battery life and a fancy leather carrying case. That device is a bit too opulent for the everyday consumer at $290, so it\u2019s no surprise Amazon isn\u2019t willingly cutting the price on that device. \n"}
