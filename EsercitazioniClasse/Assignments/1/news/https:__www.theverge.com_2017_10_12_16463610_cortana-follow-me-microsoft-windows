{"title": "Windows 10 might get easier to navigate with new Cortana Follow Me", "content": " \nNoted Microsoft watcher WalkingCat has spotted a really nifty upcoming feature for Windows called Follow Me, that uses the Cortana for guided navigation. WalkingCat posted a one minute video on Twitter showing the Cortana voice assistant guiding a user with visual prompts on the screen. In the example given, the user wants to connect a Bluetooth device and a blue circle shows which menus to click to get to the appropriate settings. The user can quit the navigation at any time using the ESC key. \nEarlier this year Microsoft demonstrated Cortana\u2019s ability to set up your PC with just your voice, so this seems to be a natural progression of that. It\u2019s also similar to the guided help Microsoft dropped years earlier with Windows Vista. WalkingCat doesn\u2019t offer any release information, but the Fall Creators Update will be available next week \u2014 maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and see it then.\n\n"}
