{"title": "One Video: Wolves by Selena Gomez and Marshmello", "content": " \nEvery week, a slew of new music videos hits the web. Watching them at your desk is not time theft because you deserve it; think of it as a nice reward for surviving another work week. But what if you don\u2019t have time to watch every video \u2014 maybe you have a deadline, a hungry pet, or other grown-up concerns. In consideration of your schedule, Lizzie and Kaitlyn bring you a series called One Video. Each week we\u2019ll tell you \u201cone video\u201d you need to watch, why, and for how long.\nThis week\u2019s video: \u201cWolves\u201d by Selena Gomez and Marshmello\nKaitlyn: Just to be clear, we would never tell you to watch Taylor Swift write and rewrite the medium-dumb song \u201cGorgeous\u201d for 10 and a half minutes in a bowler hat. We also wouldn\u2019t tell you not to! You can make your own choices. Except for when it comes to picking out your weekly allotted music video viewing, in which case we have actually made a choice for you. \nIt\u2019s Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cWolves (Vertical Video),\u201d which is a vertical music video she posted to YouTube, which has a horizontal video player. The video is vertical because it takes place in iMessage and FaceTime. How novel! How appropriate for the day of a massive new iPhone review, wouldn\u2019t you agree? \nLizzie: According to the internet, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are back together again. According to US Weekly, Bieber has been \u201ctexting her nonstop.\u201d I think then we can assume that this video was recorded prior to the reemergence of Seltin, because Selena is seen video chatting for a full three minutes and 41 seconds with the DJ Marshmello, seemingly unconcerned about checking her texts. \nWho are Selena Gomez and Marshmello?\nKaitlyn: Selena Gomez is a former Disney Channel star and a current reluctant Instagram icon. She\u2019s also a pop star, and has been making some interesting choices lately. She kicked off her summer with a Talking Heads bass line and followed it up by putting her tongue in an eyelash curler. She released an elaborate, impressive music video in which she played several different 1970s archetypes, and then she released another in which she was just a mouth. Her latest choice is a watery collaboration with Marshmello, which was advertised with what appears to be a T-shirt she brought back from a motorcycle rally in South Dakota: \n\n\nI've been running through the jungle, I've been crying with the wolves. 10.25. pic.twitter.com/ZN9vZTcPnZ\u2014 Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) October 23, 2017\n\n\n\nLizzie: Marshmello is an anonymous DJ who wears an X-eyed marshmallow mask to conceal his identity. Marshmello has yet to officially reveal his face, but the current prevailing theory is that he\u2019s Christian Comstock, who also performs as the DJ Dotcom. The evidence so far is this: Skrillex referred to Marshmello as \u201cChris\u201d in a recorded interview with Katie Couric; Skrillex posted a Facebook video on May 20th celebrating Marshmello\u2019s birthday (Dotcom\u2019s birthday is apparently on May 19th); and there is a grainy image floating around that appears to show Marshmello and Dotcom with matching thigh tattoos.  \nWhat\u2019s special about \u201cWolves\u201d by Selena Gomez and Marshmello: \nLizzie: It\u2019s a vertical video, made for watching on your phone. You can watch it either stationary or on the go, which is considerate of Selena\u2019s jet-setting fans (like maybe Justin Bieber). You can also pretend that Selena is FaceTiming you, her good friend, as she dances around her immaculate mansion with hair that\u2019s meant to look post-shower casual, but was probably styled for hours.\nThe best part about this video is that it\u2019s probably supposed to look spontaneous and intimate, like Beyonce\u2019s \u201c7/11\u201d video, but it feels forced. Why would Selena put on a silk pink robe and dance on a picnic table while the anonymous DJ Marshmello watches? It\u2019s for us. We\u2019re the anonymous DJ Marshmello.\nKaitlyn: What\u2019s special about \u201cWolves\u201d is that it cements Selena Gomez\u2019s status as a true innovator and visionary when it comes to music video format. She was also the first pop star to release a vertical video that was specifically designed for Spotify\u2019s mobile app. She is whole-heartedly embracing the trend of releasing high-production lyric videos in advance of traditional music videos, which is a nice little trick that lets her double down on streams. She\u2019s willing to try anything, it seems, and she\u2019s willing to come find you on any app and any device. \nHow long everyone should watch \u201cWolves\u201d by Selena Gomez and Marshmello: \nLizzie: At least until 1:19, when you get a shot of the skylight and floor-to-ceiling windows in the kitchen. It\u2019s like House Hunters, except the potential buyer is actually super rich.\nKaitlyn: I vote for the first four seconds, where there are iMessage typing bubbles. I love watching those things go! Then you can pretty much skip to 2:26, at which point Selena finds a picnic table. She dances on it and then jumps off and almost hits her face on the camera. Whoops! We all make mistakes. \n"}
