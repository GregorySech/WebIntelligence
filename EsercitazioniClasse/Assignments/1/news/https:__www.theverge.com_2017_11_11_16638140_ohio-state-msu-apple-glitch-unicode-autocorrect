Apparently, the glitch also impacted Ohio State fans during today\u2019s game against Michigan State.\nDuring a break in the game, the university led the crowd in a card stunt to chant \u201cOHIO,\u201d using a group of people holding giant cards to form the letters. Only this time, they decided to have a bit of fun at Apple\u2019s expense, by replacing \u201cI\u201d with \u201cA[?]\u201d.\n\n\nOhio State trolling Apple  (@darrenrovell, @BleacherReport) pic.twitter.com/u7A563gi1i\u2014 Brian Havrilla (@brianhavrilla) November 11, 2017\n\n\n\nOther users took pictures of the stunt:\n\n\n.@OhioStateFB having a little fun trolling today at the @Apple glitch \u2b55\ufe0f   \u2b55\ufe0f or is it A?

The company has since corrected the problem. \n"}
