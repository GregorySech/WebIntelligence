{"title": "EVE Valkyrie creator CCP is pulling out of VR with major layoffs", "content": " \nCCP Games is closing two studios and moving away from virtual reality, one of its main focal points for the last few years. The Iceland-based company will close its branch in Atlanta and sell the one in Newcastle as part of a round of layoffs, leaving the studios in London, Reykjav\u00edk, and Shanghai. The Iceland Monitor reports that today\u2019s cuts will affect around 100 employees worldwide; CCP says that it\u2019s providing relocation opportunities or severance packages to anyone who\u2019s affected.\nCEO Hilmar Veigar P\u00e9tursson calls the changes \u201ctough, but important.\u201d CCP will continue to run its flagship title EVE Online with no changes, and it is continuing with two previously announced projects: a multiplayer PC shooter called Project Nova and a free-to-play mobile game called Project Aurora, which is being developed by external studio PlayRaven. It will also maintain support for its existing VR titles, including the sci-fi sports game Sparc and EVE Valkyrie, which was recently updated to a VR-optional title called EVE Valkyrie \u2013 Warzone.\n\u201cDespite the success of the VR games we have released we will be shifting our focus to our PC and mobile initiatives,\u201d says P\u00e9tursson. \u201cWe will continue to support our VR games but will  not be making material VR investments until we see market conditions that justify further investments beyond what we have already made.\u201d P\u00e9tursson told Iceland Monitor that CCP planned on staying out of VR for the next two to three years.\nCCP has made some of the most popular virtual reality games; P\u00e9tursson speculated early this year that EVE Gunjack, a VR turret shooter, had set \u201ca record\u201d by selling half a million copies. But the overall market remains too small for large teams to profitably develop for it, so it\u2019s not surprising to see a VR-heavy studio refocus \u2014 and, in this case, make big cuts along the way.\nCorrection: Project Aurora\u2019s developer is PlayRaven, not PlayHaven.\n"}
