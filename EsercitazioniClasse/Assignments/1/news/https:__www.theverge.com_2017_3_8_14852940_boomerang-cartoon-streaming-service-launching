It\u2019ll also add new episodes of Scooby-Doo, Tom & Jerry, and Looney Tunes over time, and it\u2019ll include some new series, one of which will be a \u201ccomedic fantasy\u201d called Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz.\nLaunching this spring for $5 per month\nThe service is being called Boomerang, after the cable channel that runs pretty much this same programming. Time Warner says Boomerang will be the first service to stream these shows online and that it\u2019ll maintain exclusive access to them. That means the service will be a must-have for anyone who wants to stream the company\u2019s huge library of classics.\nBoomerang will launch at some point this spring, with subscriptions priced at $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. It\u2019ll initially be available on iOS, Android, and the web, and Time Warner plans to expand to major streaming platforms, including Apple TV, Roku, and Amazon\u2019s Fire devices, at some point after launch.\n\n"}
