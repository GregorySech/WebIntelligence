{"title": "Settlers of Catan is coming to virtual reality this year", "content": " \nIconic board game Settlers of Catan is coming to virtual reality. A new version is being developed by game studio Experiment7 \u2014 which previously created a pair of VR takes on chess \u2014 with feedback from the original minds behind Catan. The VR game, which is coming to both Oculus Rift and Gear VR and called simply Catan VR, is described as \u201ctrue to the classic, but optimized for virtual reality\u201d with \u201ca fresh, fully-immersive format.\u201d Unfortunately, right now the creators aren\u2019t showing off what the new VR title looks like, though it appears that it will feature both a single-player and online multiplayer component.\nCatan was first released as a physical board game back in 1995, and slowly built up a huge following as people became drawn to the concept of creating and expanding settlements. It\u2019s sold more than 20 million copies and been ported to multiple digital platforms, including consoles and smartphones. There\u2019s even been talk of a movie. \u201cThe first time I saw Catan on the \u2018magic table,\u2019 I was fascinated by what VR has to offer,\u201d creator Klaus Teuber said in a statement. \u201cThe game I made in our living room with my family 25 years ago in virtual reality? It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nThe VR edition of Catan is expected to launch this holiday season. And while it\u2019ll debut on the Rift and Gear VR, there will be \u201cadditional VR platforms to follow.\u201d\n"}
