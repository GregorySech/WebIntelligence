{"title": "Someone at Apple specializes in making fake human sweat", "content": " \nWorking for the world\u2019s biggest technology company doesn\u2019t mean your job will always be glamorous. As part of a batch of Earth Day 2017 videos it uploaded today, Apple expanded on something it first told Vice News Tonight last night; there\u2019s an employee whose specialty is producing fake sweat for testing on the company\u2019s various products.\nMostly this applies to the Apple Watch, a device that millions of people sweat on every day. In the video, Apple\u2019s head of environmental technologies Rob Guzzo explains that he created a smaller subdivision within his team \u201cjust focused on skin safety.\u201d And there\u2019s good reason for that careful approach; remember when one of Fitbit\u2019s fitness trackers gave consumers a nasty skin rash? Another employee explains the rationale: \u201cWe want to mimic actual use conditions, but we\u2019re not going to go around collecting sweat from our employees.\u201d\nIn the clip from Vice News Tonight below (hi Arielle), you\u2019ll get a look at the real-world environmental testing lab. One thing I found interesting is that Apple puts its AirPods through this same sweat test \u2014 even though the wireless earbuds aren\u2019t advertised as water or sweat-resistant. This isn\u2019t unique to Apple. Garmin must have a sweat engineer. Samsung and Huawei probably do, too, and I would hope Fitbit does by now. But they haven\u2019t (yet) given their people a rare moment in the spotlight. \n\n"}
