{"title": "The Matrix Voice is a circuit board to turn your Raspberry Pi into an Amazon Echo", "content": " \nMatrix Labs recently released the Matrix Creator, a powerful Raspberry Pi accessory that adds a whole bunch of sensors to the miniature computer (including a microphone array, temperature, UV, pressure, and more), letting you extend a Raspberry Pi into a full-fledged development device with a ton of different uses. (via TechCrunch). And as a follow-up to the Matrix Creator, the company is going even smaller with the Matrix Voice \u2014 a cheaper version of the creator that focuses on one thing: voice recognition. \nThat makes it even easier to use the Matrix Voice to do something like build your own Amazon Echo using Amazon\u2019s Alexa Voice Service \u2014 which we actually did here at The Verge using the larger Matrix Creator last summer. That means instead of the wide range of sensors, the Voice just has a microphone array and a ring of LED lights. But it\u2019s also far cheaper, available for $55 on Indiegogo instead of the Creator\u2019s $99.95 price tag. A slightly more expensive version that adds a built-in microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is also available for $65.\n\nObviously, Matrix Labs is hoping that buyers will take the Voice and use it to make other things, too \u2014 the whole idea of both the Creator and the Voice is to offer a bigger range of possibilities for developers to easily try out new hardware integrations without needing to buy a range of expensive sensors. \nThe usual warning on crowdfunded products applies with the Voice (although Matrix Labs has successfully shipped the Creator, which was similarly funded, so there is a good track record there). \nThe Matrix Voice has already been fully funded on Indiegogo, and hopes to ship in May. \n"}
