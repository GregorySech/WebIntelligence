{"title": "I tried to learn Chinese and Korean using an Asian drama streaming service\u2019s new tool", "content": " \nViki, a streaming site that lets you watch Asian dramas, now has a translation tool called \u201cLearn Mode\u201d to help you learn Chinese and Korean. It\u2019s not effortless, as learning languages never is, but it\u2019s probably one of the more pleasant ways I\u2019ve attempted to learn a new language. I took Chinese classes in college, and the professor\u2019s MO was recitation and pop quizzes, so given the choice, I prefer the $4.99 a month standard Viki pass. \nWhen you activate Learn Mode on an episode, the dual subtitles (one in English and one in the original Asian language you\u2019re learning) located on the bottom of the screen become interactive. Hovering your mouse over the subtitles will automatically pause the episode, allowing you to decode each line of dialogue. \nYou can currently learn to speak Korean or Mandarin in two different accents, with the mainland Chinese influence or a Taiwanese twang. The selection and range of languages is still limited. For instance, where is Japanese and Thai on the list? Taiwan, which is a smaller producer of dramas than China or Korea and often makes more low-budget shows, also needs more of a selection here. There are some non-cheesy, good Taiwanese shows like Meteor Garden, which is the Taiwanese adaptation of a romantic Japanese manga, and KO One, about a delinquent high school class that has demonic powers, not on the list yet. It\u2019s clear that whoever curated the list of available dramas in Learn Mode is a huge fan of Lee Min-ho (Boys Over Flowers, The Legend of the Blue Sea) and Jun Ji-hyun (The Legend of the Blue Sea, My Love From the Star), but so am I, so that\u2019s fine with me.\nUnlike apps like Duolingo, which doesn\u2019t offer any Chinese, or private tutors, which require money and scheduled time, Viki\u2019s Learn Mode makes learning Chinese and Korean a lot less painful. Guided by subtitles, a dictionary definition, and the sound of each word, you\u2019ll begin to learn what\u2019s what just by watching TV. Sure, you\u2019ll be clueless of grammar, but you\u2019ll get pronunciation, an expanded vocabulary, and probably, a dose more passion and interest. And, if you\u2019re into multitasking, you can admire South Korea\u2019s resident babe, Lee Min-ho, or marvel at how Jun Ji-hyun does not age, while parsing each character of the sentence they\u2019re speaking. \nOn the flip side, you might find that the pacing of your drama is totally ruined by the constant pausing you have to do when your mouse hovers over a Chinese character. And what if you\u2019re just scratching your arm and accidentally shift the mouse over the screen? Instant pause. \nIf you're thrifty, you don't actually need Learn Mode; you just need to be willing to keep rewinding whatever you're watching. But I\u2019ve tried the virtually free way of learning Cantonese solely through watching film before and it\u2019s not pretty. I watched and rewatched Wong Kar-wai\u2019s Hong Kong classic In the Mood for Love first with my boyfriend, and then my dad. Everything slipped through one ear and out the other, but I could imagine myself learning the language by pausing at every scene, repeating each phonetic sound I heard and hoping that it strung together a sentence. After a dozen years watching anime and eight years of watching Korean dramas, to this day, I still can only say, \u201chello,\u201d \u201cthank you,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re stupid,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry,\u201d in Korean and Japanese, which is the extent that listening passively can help my language learning. \nI often think, with a sense of regret, if only I were a one-year-old child! Then I\u2019d be a polyglot.\nUpdate September 28th, 3:30PM ET: This article was corrected to reflect that Duolingo does offer some Asian languages such as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese.\n"}
