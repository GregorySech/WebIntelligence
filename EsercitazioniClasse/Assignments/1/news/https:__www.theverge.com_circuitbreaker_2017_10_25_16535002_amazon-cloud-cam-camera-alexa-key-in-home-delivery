{"title": "Amazon\u2019s latest Alexa-enabled device is a home security camera", "content": " This morning, Amazon announced a new service called Key. It allows Prime customers to  get in-home delivery, meaning the courier will unlock your front door and drop the package off inside. To work, Amazon is releasing a brand-new gadget called the Cloud Cam. It\u2019s a indoor home security camera that acts as the brains for a smart lock, allowing Amazon to decide when it should open your house for a delivery. But it\u2019s also a standalone offering, and another in the growing family of Alexa-enabled devices that promise to integrate Amazon into every part of your home life.The Cloud Cam captures 1080p resolution video, and boasts night vision, two-way audio, a wide viewing angle, and activity clips from the last 24 hours via the Amazon Cloud Cam app. You can purchase one for $119.99, or get it bundled with a smart lock for $249.99 if you\u2019re buying the Amazon Key in-home delivery bundle. The Cloud Cam also is available for less than $100 each, via a two-pack for $199.99 or a three-pack for $289.99.The Amazon Cloud Cam app.Image: AmazonThe device has motion detection and computer vision. The first half of that equation is pretty simple to explain. Amazon is promising that the camera will be able to detect motion and automatically record a video clip for you to review later, along with sending a notification. The second part is more interesting, but not yet fully baked. Amazon says Cloud Cam will send clips to the cloud for review. Over time, it should be able to learn what belongs in the house, like, say, your dog, and stop triggering alerts every time it sees the pooch walking around. \u201cWith intelligence that lives in the AWS cloud, over time you will see more advanced detection, alerts, and other new features become available in the service and on the camera itself, such as advanced audio alerts or pet detection, without having to purchase a new device,\u201d Amazon says.Cloud Cam stream on an Echo Show.Image: AmazonFor now, however, it sounds like those advanced features will only be available to subscribers. The basic purchase of a Cloud Cam gets you 24 hours of storage for video clips and support for three cameras with basic motion detection. Beyond that, there a number of tiers with different options. Basic  $6.99 / month, $69 / year  offers access to the last seven days of motion detection clips for up to three camerasExtended  $9.99 / month, $99 / year  offers access to the last 14 days of motion detection clips for up to five camerasPro  $19.99 / month, $199 / year  offers access to the last 30 days of motion detection clips for up to 10 camerasAmazon says that each subscription offers person detection, which flags human activity instead of general motion  like a pet walking , and zones, which lets you indicate certain areas of your home with motion that you want ignored  like a ceiling fan . Customers can try any subscription free for thirty days.Amazon\u2019s Cloud Cam mounted on a wall.Image: AmazonEach Cloud Cam has a speaker and microphone, so you can talk to your pet from work or scold your kids from the office. The camera is designed to operate as a freestanding unit or mounted to a wall, but it has to be plugged in to work. Amazon\u2019s hardware and subscription plans are both significantly cheaper than the comparable offerings sold by Nest. It\u2019s also cheaper than the latest hardware and subscription offerings from Logi and is competitive with products from similar home camera companies, like Canary and Ring, as well. But at the moment, Amazon doesn\u2019t offer the same range of models, nor does it have a camera that will stand up to rain. Of course, Amazon\u2019s real advantage over the competition isn\u2019t the basic price of the device and cloud services \u2014 it\u2019s that your hardware comes with access to secure and convenient in-home delivery. The failure or success of this device probably rests, at least at first, on how many Prime customers decide to sign up for Amazon Key."}
