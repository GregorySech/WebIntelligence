{"title": "You can now earn a degree in \u2018self-driving cars\u2019 courtesy of Lyft and Udacity", "content": " \nStarting today, online teaching startup Udacity is opening registration for a new \u201cIntro to Self-Driving Cars\u201d course to anyone in the world with an internet connection. The four-month \u201cnanodegree\u201d class is $800 to enroll, but ride-hailing service Lyft is teaming up with Udacity to offer 400 scholarships specifically targeted at students from communities underrepresented in the tech world. \nThe only prerequisites for students interested in the intro class are some programming experience (e.g. C++, Python) and algebra. Graduates will be eligible to automatically enroll in Udacity's year-old Self-Driving Car or Robotics Nanodegree programs, which is more focused on providing students with the skills necessary to land a job in the fast-growing autonomous vehicle market.\n\u201cThere is an enormous market for engineers of self-driving cars\u201d\nThe rush to develop self-driving cars is fueling lucrative deals for tech startups specializing in AI, robotics, and vision hardware, but its also creating a strain on applied science schools to produce the talent needed to design and build these vehicles. And with salaries ranging from $200,000 to $400,000 for engineering positions, the number of students seeking to specialize in self-driving cars is predicted to grow exponentially. \nUdacity, which first launched in 2011 and offers micro-credentials certification courses designed to make applicants job-ready, believes it is uniquely positioned to fill that need. Sebastian Thrun, the founder and president, was the first leader of Google\u2019s Self-Driving Car project, a job he took after managing Stanford\u2019s winning team in the Defense Department\u2019s DARPA competitions, the legendary 2005 Grand Challenge and 2007 Urban Challenge that gave rise to many of the autonomous vehicles we see in operation today.\n\u201cThere is an enormous market for engineers of self-driving cars,\u201d Thrun says in a video marketing Udacity\u2019s nanodegree program. \u201cLots and lots of companies that you wouldn\u2019t suspect have entered that field and are massively hiring.\u201d\nSince kicking off its Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program one year ago, more more than 43,000 people have applied and over 10,000 students have enrolled from 50 countries, Udacity says. Nearly 60 of the nanodegree program\u2019s students have already landed new jobs \u2014 before graduating later this year.\nLyft\u2019s interest in funding scholarships for the new intro course isn\u2019t entirely selfless. The ride-hailing company recently announced its plan to begin building its own software and hardware to power self-driving cars. To accomplish this, Lyft says it will open a new 50,000-square-foot engineering facility in Palo Alto, California, which it\u2019s calling the \u201cLevel 5\u201d center in reference to the most advanced level of autonomous driving. The goal is to have \u201chundreds\u201d of engineers working out of the facility by the end of 2018, Lyft says. Perhaps some of those engineers will be Udacity graduates. \n"}
