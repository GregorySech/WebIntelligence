{"title": "The director of Netflix\u2019s Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker movie wants you to stand up for the press", "content": " \nThe day Gawker officially shut down, crippled by a legal battle with Hulk Hogan and billionaire financier Peter Thiel, founder Nick Denton published the site\u2019s final post. In an essay called \u201cHow Things Work,\u201d he argued that Gawker\u2019s death wasn\u2019t a freak accident or an avoidable tragedy, so much as its inevitable fate: \u201cGawker\u2019s demise turns out to be the ultimate Gawker story. It shows how things work.\u201d\nThe piece carries the tone and tenor of a rising tide of liberal conspiracy theories. In a vacuum, the basic facts of the Gawker story sound like something dredged up from the more unhinged corners of Reddit. The way money, power, and the First Amendment faced off in the 2016 case is almost too cinematic to even function with a documentary film as its framework. So The Internet\u2019s Own Boy director Bryan Knappenberger had his work cut out for him when he tackled the Gawker story in Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press, which will be available on Netflix on Friday, June 23rd.\nIn Nobody Speak, Knappenberger tries to get the Gawker lawsuit saga down, alongside the story of billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson secretly buying the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2015. And he adds in a decent overview of how President Trump has largely succeeded in playing off a simmering public distrust of the media. With less than two hours to get into it all, the film has to move at a breakneck pace. Knowing that Nobody Speak debuted at Sundance less than 10 months after the initial Gawker verdict, it\u2019s easy to wish Knappenberger had the resources or time to make something longer, and more logically segmented.\nthe documentary, if uneven, needed to exist\nPeople who followed the Gawker case as it developed won\u2019t find any major revelations in Nobody Speak, any new insights to set them back on their heels, or revise their opinions. And while Knappenberger says he had no trouble finding Gawker employees who wanted to talk about the case, it\u2019s glaringly obvious that Denton and executive editor John Cook are the only on-camera interviewees who were still at the company in 2016.\nIt\u2019s odd that Nobody Speak opens on former Gawker editor-in-chief A.J. Daulerio, then completely abandons him by its end. Instead, the film heavily prioritizes Denton\u2019s perspective. True, that structure does parallel the way Daulerio claims Gawker Media and Denton left him to grapple with the lawsuit\u2019s $115 million penalty on his own. When Daulerio published the infamous Hulk Hogan sex tape, and Hogan successfully sued over invasion of privacy, Denton and the company protected themselves with bankruptcy filings. Gawker.com itself was shuttered, but Gawker Media, and Gawker\u2019s sister sites, were able to survive. Daulerio\u2019s account is just one side of the story, of course, but it doesn\u2019t get much space in Nobody Speak, which generally presents Denton as a pillar of the free press and a protector of journalists. And yet Knappenberger doesn\u2019t particularly address the question of what happens to individual journalists in a media outlet lawsuit; he only focuses on the outcome for the publication itself. \nSo as a documentary, Nobody Speak is a little uneven. But as a cultural object that needed to exist, it\u2019s welcome for the way it sums up the case and presents it to viewers. Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the message, and this is a great example: releasing the documentary on Netflix puts a full-throated argument for the value of an oppositional press into the streaming catalog of 100 million Netflix subscribers (rather than dropping into a few hundred major city cinemas, where only the already-inclined would see it). Netflix\u2019s high-profile documentary distribution is the best thing it\u2019s done for film so far, making viral hits out of Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th, Liz Garbus\u2019 What Happened, Miss Simone?, and many other films.\nRecently, I sat down with Knappenberger to hear more about why he\u2019s dedicated his career to documenting money and power on the internet, what he thinks the press should do next, and why his movie was perfect for Netflix. \nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat got you interested in the Gawker story, and in making a documentary about it?  \nIt was the first time a sex tape case like this had ever gone to trial. It was this big, tabloid-y, salacious kind of thing, but at the same time, it was pretty obvious that there were some big-picture \u201cprivacy vs. First Amendment\u201d things at stake. It wasn\u2019t an easy case, it wasn\u2019t a simple case, and it was right at the fringes of acceptability. I had some sympathy for Hulk Hogan\u2019s case.\nWhat really clicked it in was when that $140 million verdict came down. It was so enormous, combined with the requirement to put up $50 million right away. That was the death sentence for Gawker, and whatever you thought about them, it became scary that they weren\u2019t allowed to exist anymore. And then, of course, the fact that Peter Thiel was funding Hulk Hogan\u2019s case. That was bizarre from a storytelling perspective, and disturbing that it was done in secret. \nI think it\u2019s John Cook who argues in the documentary that this could be the moment in the history of the free press where say, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s where it all went really wrong.\u201d Would you say that\u2019s true? \nI would. I always try to make the case that, with both the Peter Thiel story and the Sheldon Adelson story, there are elements that aren\u2019t new. In the Thiel case, litigation financing is not new, that\u2019s not unheard of. Even the ACLU will pick a case and come down and support one side to make a political point. But the secrecy is new, and the way Peter Thiel moved the chess pieces behind the scenes is new. I don\u2019t see any reason that couldn\u2019t be applied to any other journalistic outlet. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a canary in the coal mine element to this.\u201d\nWith Adelson, very rich people have often bought newspapers, but the secretive way he went about buying that newspaper seems odd, and like something we need to pay attention to. There\u2019s a \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d element to this. Inequality has gotten so staggering. This gap between the uber-rich and everybody else is so enormous, and journalism is so vulnerable. [We\u2019ll] look back at this moment as incredibly significant. \nSo why bring this documentary to Netflix specifically? \nWe finished it right before Sundance, and we started the film right after the verdict. By documentary standards, that\u2019s pretty fast. We were in a big rush to premiere it by Sundance, and we didn\u2019t show it to anybody before that. A lot of people were interested there, but for lots of reasons, Netflix seemed like a great partner. I loved the fact that they\u2019re in 190 countries, they have 100 million subscribers, and they\u2019re in 25 languages. There\u2019s no other platform like that for a documentary. It seemed like the right path, rather than an extended theatrical run. \n\u201calmost every time it had an opportunity to take a turn, it took the more bizarre direction.\u201d\nThe Gawker story sounds like a conspiracy theory. All these intersecting threads of money and power and vindictiveness and betrayal, it sounds fake. How do you make that accessible to an audience that might not be sympathetic toward the media?\nI hope there\u2019s enough for almost anybody to come to this story. The way I go about that is just to tell the story. Tell the series of events, and the way they happened, in the order they unfolded. They are bizarre, and almost every time it had an opportunity to take a turn, it took the more bizarre direction. \nNot many people have made films about online media. A lot of movies about the internet don\u2019t really connect with the full scope of the issues.\nIt\u2019s a classic problem. But as a filmmaker, you can\u2019t be afraid of that now. Our whole lives exist online, and so much drama that\u2019s important [is online]. As a documentarian, you want to document the human condition \u2014 and most of it is online. You have to figure out how to do that, whether it\u2019s with graphics or showing post or animating type. You have to find ways to solve problems as they come up. That paints you into a corner, but it\u2019s a good corner, creatively, to try to get out of. \nAre there are other filmmakers out there who are doing that well? \nNobody is operating on my level, I don\u2019t think. [Laughs] I think filmmakers are struggling with this. But it\u2019s not just filmmakers, it\u2019s also when you try to pitch stories. Often, you get this kind of pushback. People say, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s interesting, but how is it visual?\u201d It\u2019s a good question for a visual medium, but it\u2019s a question you have to answer. These stories need to get told. They\u2019re the most interesting and relevant stories happening. I also really believe we\u2019re not in a world anymore where somehow the internet is the realm of geeks, hackers, coders, and programmers. That\u2019s the world. You spend your entire life offline. \n\u201cYou want to document the human condition \u2014 well, most of it is online.\u201d\nI love staying in this territory. I genuinely think our lives are shifting in the ways we communicate, in all sorts of ways. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out yet. As new technology hits and changes who we are, how does that affect traditional values of human rights and civil liberties, and the kinds of things we feel work in a democracy? How does technology change that? Those are the most interesting stories, and the hardest stories.\nWriters have compared Trump to Nixon, in terms of his attacks on the press and the way he\u2019s encouraged distrust of the press. But Nixon gave the press one of its finest hours. Do you think people are handling that moment well this time around?\nI do, actually. I think there\u2019s great reporting coming from The Washington Post, The New York Times, and others. That\u2019s kind of my silver lining in all this. I do feel like this daily hostility that Trump shows toward the press, and this fear, real fear, has sparked good journalism and reminded people what they\u2019re there for. There are legitimate criticisms of the press, and there\u2019s a reason people\u2019s opinion of the media is so low: I think it\u2019s become too corporatized over time, [and] there\u2019s a legitimate criticism that it\u2019s gotten too cozy with power, that it\u2019s traded softball stories for access to power and celebrity. But people are reevaluating that now that they have this common enemy, and I have some optimism in that. \n\u201cThere are legitimate criticisms of the press.\u201d\nIn the film, when you\u2019re discussing Peter Thiel secretly funding this lawsuit due to a personal vendetta, John Cook says something about Silicon Valley being an \u201cinvisible monster.\u201d Is that something you want to keep looking at with future documentaries? \nDefinitely. If you take DC, there\u2019s the whole Washington press corps that\u2019s set up around reporting on power. They might not be good enough. They could be much stronger. The same is true in New York around financial coverage. There are a lot of news outlets, and a whole industry set up to talk about Wall Street. They aren\u2019t good enough either, they didn\u2019t see the 2008 crisis coming, which was kind of their job. There\u2019s a whole press corps in LA around celebrity. But if you think about Silicon Valley, there\u2019s so much money and so much power there, and almost no adversarial journalism.\nIt\u2019s hard to find good, solid journalism about Silicon Valley. Most of the time, what passes as journalism is just showing up to product launches and clapping for the new thing. And I think that\u2019s what the powerful in Silicon Valley think the role of the press is. \u201cYou are here to help us sell products, get stuff out of our PR wing.\u201d But you know, I think this thing with Uber is a pretty good example of the press doggedly going after this toxic culture created by this guy. That\u2019s a hopeful story. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Mark Humphrey / Netflix\n\n\nSome people would say it\u2019s unfortunate, though, because a lot of Gawker reporters originally poked at those Silicon Valley cultures, with blog posts that were called mean or stupid at the time.\nThat\u2019s true! Peter Thiel said of Gawker that they\u2019re bad for the Valley, or the Al Qaeda of the Valley, or something, because they dared to do stories that were critical of power, when so few people do that. \nSo what do you want people who watch this documentary to take away from it? Is there anything they should do? \nI want them to take away the fact that a free, independent, adversarial press is important. They should support it financially and stand up for the concept. It\u2019s weird to find ourselves in a position where we have to stand up for the concept itself, but I think we do. There are so many daily attacks on the media. There\u2019s so much distortion about what it is and how it\u2019s biased. You have to question that stuff, but that doesn\u2019t mean you throw it out or damage it or, god forbid, pass some kind of law that diminishes it. Stand up for our press, stand up against frivolous lawsuits, and demand transparency.\nNobody Speak will be available to stream on Netflix on June 23rd.\n"}
