{"title": "Nintendo can\u2019t make Switch consoles fast enough", "content": " \nNintendo just announced the latest sales figures for the Switch in its Q1 earnings, and the 2 million units sold are both impressive for the company and a measure of how successful the Switch has become. It\u2019s even more significant given that the company is still rebounding from the commercial and critical failure of the Wii U, which only sold about 13.5 million units over its entire lifespan. \nIf only Nintendo could manage to keep the Switch in stock\nThe biggest takeaway from the Switch\u2019s Q1 performance: the number could have been even higher, if only Nintendo could manage to keep the Switch in stock. Months after the Switch\u2019s release in March, it\u2019s still virtually impossible to actually walk into a store and buy one. \nAnd while sales are certainly doing well, it doesn\u2019t seem that Nintendo is planning to change its current manufacturing and stocking process, as the company is still keeping its sales forecast for the year at 13 million consoles (the same as it was earlier this year), despite the apparent demand. \nAlong with Switch sales, Nintendo also announced overall numbers for its Q1 earnings. The company reported revenue of 154 billion yen ($1.37 billion) and an operating profit of 16.2 billion yen ($144.8 million), both improvements over last year\u2019s first quarter, where the company reported an operating loss of 5.1 billion yen as it transitioned from the Wii U to the Switch. \n"}
