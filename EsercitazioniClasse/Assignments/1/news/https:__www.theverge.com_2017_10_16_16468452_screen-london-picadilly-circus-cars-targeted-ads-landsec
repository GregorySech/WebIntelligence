As first spotted by Wired, the 790 square meter screen can produce 281 trillion different colors from 11 million pixels spaced 8 millimeters apart. It will be the largest display of its type \u2014 about the size of four tennis courts \u2014 in Europe when it\u2019s switched on later this month. Landsec, the company that owns the screen, says it features recognition technology that\u2019s influenced by the people and things around it, allowing ads to better target local viewers. \nLandsec says hidden cameras will analyze the make, model, and color of cars that drive by as well as the age, gender, and even the feelings of nearby pedestrians in order to customize ads for the local audience. The technology can be used to program certain ads to play when specific cars drives past, for example, or in response to weather changes, or news and sport reports. The new screen will also provide complimentary Wi-Fi for people in the surrounding area.\nIn an email to The Verge, a spokesperson for Landsec said the screen can react to these external factors, but would do so without collecting or storing any personal details. \u201cFor example, the branded content displayed on the screen could change depending on the color of vehicles,\u201d she said. How the technology is used depends on the approach chosen by the brands.\nThis giant spying screen will replace six separate ones that used to each represent a different brand. Every ten minutes, one ad will fill the entire screen for 30 seconds \u2014 the first brands to debut will include Samsung, Coca-Cola, Hyundai, and L'Oreal. \n\nFor the majority of the time though, the screen will be split up into the traditional six sections that will stream live video, sports results, and feeds from various social media platforms. As such, Landsec said it hopes that brands will be able to create content people will be able to react to, say through tweets or Facebook posts. \nLandsec hasn't specified an exact date for when the screen will be turned on because it doesn\u2019t want to cause overcrowding in the already busy traffic junction and tourist destination.\n"}
