{"title": "Patty Jenkins gave a great response to James Cameron\u2019s dumb Wonder Woman comments", "content": " \nWith a filmography full of characters like Aliens\u2019 Ellen Ripley and The Terminator\u2019s Sarah Connor, James Cameron is often credited with making movies that feature strong female leads. When recently asked about the tremendous success of Wonder Woman, however, his response came off as rather dismissive.\nIn an interview with The Guardian, he said, amidst a long and confusing conversation about \u201cstrong, independent women\u201d in film and his personal life, that he did not care for the film or its reception. \u201cAll of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood\u2019s been doing over Wonder Woman has been so misguided,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s an objectified icon, and it\u2019s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t like the movie but, to me, it\u2019s a step backwards.\u201d\nwhat\u2019s an objectified icon?\nHe continued without explaining how Patty Jenkins counts as a member of \u201cmale Hollywood,\u201d and next pointed out the key difference between Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman and what he considered a more appropriate heroine \u2014 the one he wrote in his 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day: \u201cSarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female!\u201d \nIn a tweeted note, Jenkins responded, \u201cStrong women are great... But if women have to always be hard, tough[,] and troubled to be strong, and we aren\u2019t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven\u2019t come very far have we.\u201d\n\n\npic.twitter.com/8zkJXHLCJW\u2014 Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) August 25, 2017\n\n\n\nObviously there\u2019s no need for Patty Jenkins to respond to any of these comments, as her movie was beloved by audiences and critics and many of her peers. It is the top-grossing blockbuster ever directed by a woman, and it outgrossed the debut films for Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man. Women made up 52 percent of the opening weekend audience for Wonder Woman, while most superhero movies see them making up 40 percent or less. But since Jenkins did respond, it\u2019s worth noting that her arguments are spot-on.\nTo suggest that women don\u2019t know how to decide for themselves whether a character represents them, or whether a film is worth spending their money on, is to argue that women do not have brains. As Jenkins wrote, \u201cThe massive female audience who made the film [the] hit it is, can surely choose and judge their own icons of progress.\u201d James Cameron\u2019s assertion that he knows more about what matters to women who are looking to see more of themselves on screen than the women do themselves is so ridiculous I don\u2019t even really know how to begin arguing against it, so I\u2019m glad Jenkins found the succinct rebuttal for me: \u201cHe is not a woman.\u201d \nAsked in the same interview to explain why, in his mind, representation of women in film is still so bad, Cameron said \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. There are many women in power in Hollywood and they do get to guide and shape what films get made. I think \u2014 no, I can\u2019t account for it.\u201d \nUh, hi James. I can! \nUpdate August 25th, 2:32PM: Added additional information about James Cameron\u2019s filmography.\n"}
