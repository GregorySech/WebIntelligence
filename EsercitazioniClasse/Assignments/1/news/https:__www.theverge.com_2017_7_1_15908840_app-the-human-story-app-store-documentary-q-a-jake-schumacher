{"title": "The filmmaker behind \u2018App: The Human Story\u2019 talks about the struggles developers face", "content": " \nEver since smartphones became the default computers that we carry our pockets, the apps that run on them and the stores that sell these apps have created a new kind of economy for software. Apple\u2019s App Store has swelled to more than 2.5 million apps, while the Google Play Store surpasses that with 2.8 million apps available. But even as these companies boast about the payouts to app makers \u2014 last month Apple said that developer earnings had surpassed $70 billion \u2014 the truth is that many app makers have a hard time making any significant money from their mobile app businesses. \nThat\u2019s partly what inspired filmmakers Jake Schumacher, Jedidiah Hurt, and Adam Lisagor to spend three and a half years producing a documentary about apps \u2014 or more specifically, the people who make them. \u201cApp: The Human Story\u201d follows different groups of indie developers as they go through the app building, fundraising, store approval, and selling processes (including Cabel Sasser and Steven Frank of Oregon-based Panic, Melissa Hargis and Nicki Klein of Betagig, and Ish Shabazz, who makes a variety of apps under the LLC Illuminated Bits). The \u201cdevaluation of apps\u201d is a core theme of the film, according to Schumacher, along with the \u201cstruggle for sustainability.\u201d \nThe film was screened last month as part of a peripheral event at Apple\u2019s WWDC, and is slated to be released late summer. The Verge interviewed Schumacher about the inspiration behind the film, the biggest complaints he heard from developers, and his thoughts on the future of apps. The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed for length. \nLauren Goode:  Are you an app maker yourself? \nJake Schumacher: I have a partner in an app that\u2019s in the App Store. It\u2019s just kind of sitting there. It\u2019s called Quantify. It allows you to heat map interviews. You would rate the small talk as zero, and then as we get into things of interest, you could give it a one or two or three, so you have a heat-mapped audio recording and you can jump back to the key parts really easily. We made it as an interview tool, and then Marc Edwards was super generous and offered to design it for us. \nLG: How long have you been working on the film?\nJS: In earnest about three and a half years. We did six months of prep for our Kickstarter, and launched that three years ago almost to the day. And we\u2019ve been in active production for about three years, and mostly editing the last year and a half. \nLG: What made you want to make this film?\nJS: My now co-director and I are both from a small town \u2014 Twin Falls, Idaho. We were celebrating winning a small film festival there that I had entered and won. He was interested in getting into mobile development, and I was interested in making a feature film. It was sort of a world I found fascinating. I was going to document him making his first app, which in retrospect was a terrible idea. But then I moved to L.A. about five years ago, and I met Adam Lisagor who runs Sandwich Video. He happens to know a few prominent app developers, and he introduced us, and we just sort of went from there. \n\u201cA lot of these people are longtime app developers who have stuck with Apple since 1997. It\u2019s kind of this unrequited love story.\u201d\nLG: Does the film only emphasize iOS app makers, or are there Android apps and app makers, too? \nJS: Matias Duarte [the vice president of Material Design at Google] is in it. We have other [Android-focused] people around in it. We kind of focus on iOS as the main subject because of the stated values of Apple and what the App Store has become. And also, because of what was happening with indie developers. A lot of these people are longtime app developers who have stuck with Apple even since 1997. It\u2019s kind of this unrequited love story. \nLG: And how many developers total have you interviewed?\nJS: Around 46 or 47. I think we\u2019re going to release the full interviews from around 40. \nLG: What surprised you the most in your conversations with app makers? Were there any consistent themes that kept coming up? \nJS: I think the struggle for sustainability in the App Store. A lot of these people or companies are prominent developers, they\u2019ve been making apps for a long time, they may be very successful companies, and they\u2019re still talking about sustainability, trying to figure it out. I think early on the tools didn\u2019t mature for mobile developers in terms of selling their [software]. On Mac or on the web they could do things like upgrade pricing, they could do free trials and say, hey, pay $50 to start, they could let a consumer kick the tires and make a decision. \nLG: Last year Apple made some changes to the App Store revenue split for long-term subscriptions, they were really pushing subscriptions, and started to finally address some of the things developers had been asking for [The Verge wrote about it extensively], but is there one thing you heard developers say they still wish they had or would change? \nJS: I think most developers wish, if Apple gave them everything they wanted\u2026there\u2019s a valuation problem that\u2019s happened in the past. The devaluation of apps is kind of core to the film. So many people assume an app should be free. There are too many instances of a 99-cent app becoming \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d So even if developers had every tool tomorrow, there\u2019s some damage that\u2019s been done. I think if they could have something they would get more of a percentage back. That original pitch for the 30 percent [Apple\u2019s share of revenue] \u2014 the promise of curation, and promotion \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that was ever fully delivered on.\n\u201cSo many people assume an app should be free. There are too many instances of a 99-cent app becoming \u2018too expensive.\u2019\u201d\nLG: There have been instances of very successful app makers, people making money, actually being spammy or downright scammy, like this recent Medium story. Is that addressed in the film? \nJS: People in the film really covered the idea of addiction-based games. There was definitely frustration there. These are people who care about humanity or who are trying to build real tools, and these game makers\u2026some people would argue that this is a free market doing what it will. But it\u2019s not a free market. It\u2019s Apple\u2019s App Store. So I think one frustrating thing is that Apple shows the revenue paid to developers, but I think a lot of indie developers would like to see how much of that goes to spammy game makers. \nLG: What do you think \u201capps\u201d will be in five years? Right now it seems like there are trends towards people downloading fewer new apps, and there are contextually aware notifications happening that mean you don\u2019t even have to open apps, and then there\u2019s voice control\u2026 do you think mobile apps will still be mobile apps in five years, in the same containers, or will they be totally different? \nJS: I sure like the trend towards disappearing apps, where apps are moving toward the peripheral. I like the idea of them being less in our face and [requiring] less interaction; apps that know what you need, when you need it. \nEditor\u2019s note: A trailer for the film can be found here. I noted to Schumacher that the trailer contains an overwhelming number of male speakers and only one speaking female developer, but Schumacher said that a new trailer is in the process of being cut and that the film itself features female app developers as a key part of the storyline. \nCorrection: Story has been updated to correct location of Schumacher\u2019s hometown. \n \n"}
