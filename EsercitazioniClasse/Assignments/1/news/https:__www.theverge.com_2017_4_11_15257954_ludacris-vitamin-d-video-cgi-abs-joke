{"title": "Ludacris' CGI abs are a joke the rapper has been making for over a decade", "content": " \nYesterday, Ludacris released a video for his new track \u201cVitamin D,\u201d but the only thing anyone was paying attention to were his abs. The video, starring Luda as a plastic surgeon, features our hero sporting a six-pack that is very obviously more CGI than crunches. It would be strange and funny if these CG-abs were the result of vanity, insecurity, and an amateur graphics artist, but obvious-looking CGI is kinda Luda\u2019s thing. As Stereogum points out, Ludacris has been doing this for years, even if it took some of his fans a minute to remember that.\n\n\nIt's ok they slow RT @chris_oneto: he's supposed to have CGI & he looks at them at the end of the video & sees em gone. It's intentional\u2014 Ludacris (@Ludacris) April 11, 2017\n\n\n\nThe rapper\u2019s foray into CGI body-morphing seems to have began in 2001, when he dropped a video for \u201cRollout.\u201d In that clip, Luda gave himself a tiny body and a big head (or maybe a normal-sized head that looks bigger in the tiny body context).\n\nIn 2003\u2019s \u201cStand Up,\u201d Ludacris gives himself the body of a baby, which is probably not the move of a man worried that his pecs aren\u2019t chiseled enough. \n\nThen there\u2019s 2004\u2019s \u201cGet Back\u201d \u2014 you know, the one with the giant hands. \n\nLuda took a bit of a break in the mid-2000s to make Austin Powers parody videos before returning to his CGI habit in 2010\u2019s \u201cHow Low,\u201d in which he briefly assumes his classic tiny body look. \n\nOf course, Ludacris is not exactly a CGI music video pioneer. Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cScream\u201d video is known for its elaborate use of it, as well as the millions of dollars it cost to make in 1995. And who could forget when the guy from Counting Crows turned himself into a rabbit with bad hair?\nBut Ludacris hasn\u2019t used CGI as a one-off experiment, and he doesn\u2019t seem interested in getting into more realistic CGI as technology advances. For Ludacris, CGI forces his pattern of body manipulation in videos to extreme, weird ends. His continued use of these visuals also serves to recall all of his earlier work, even if his earlier work now looks dated. CGI is Ludacris\u2019 visual of choice, and with \u201cVitamin D,\u201d that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.\n"}
