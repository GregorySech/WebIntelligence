{"title": "Asus will unveil the ZenFone 4 on August 19th", "content": " \nAsus will unveil its newest ZenFone \u2014 the ZenFone 4 \u2014 on August 19th in the Philippines. The invitation is transparent about the fact that we can expect the new phone to include a dual-camera system and better sensors. A version of the ZenFone 4 already exists in Russia under the name ZenFone 4 Max. That phone includes dual rear-facing cameras and is powered by either a Snapdragon 430 or 425 processor. It isn't clear whether Asus will just reintroduce this phone for other markets or release a similar device. \nNow, while the ZenFone 4 is likely the same as the one already released in Russia, Asus' head of marketing, Marcel Campos, is posting photos to Instagram using the hashtag \"ZenFone X.\" He's clearly showing off what these new cameras can do, particularly with wide shots.\n\n  \n  Como era e como vai ser.   #zenfonex #wintergarden #florida #firefighter #firedepartment #usa #asus A post shared by Marcel Campos (@marcelcampos) on Jul 26, 2017 at 4:50pm PDT\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Epcot. #zenfonex #epcot #disney #disneyworld #asus A post shared by Marcel Campos (@marcelcampos) on Jul 30, 2017 at 4:48am PDT\n\n\n\n\n  \n      #zenfonex #florida #wintergarden #usa #asus A post shared by Marcel Campos (@marcelcampos) on Jul 25, 2017 at 6:08am PDT\n\n\n\nThese photos aren't bad for a mid-range Android phone, although we've seen other OEMs include dual-camera systems at an affordable price point, including Honor and even Asus with its ZenFone 3 Zoom. As is typically the case with ZenFone, the new phone will likely be released abroad at first.\n"}
