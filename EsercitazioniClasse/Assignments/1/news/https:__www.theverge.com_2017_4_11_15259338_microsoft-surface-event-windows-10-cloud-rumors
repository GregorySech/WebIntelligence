{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s spring Surface event could include Windows 10 Cloud", "content": " \nMicrosoft is still expected to hold a spring hardware event in early May, but the company could focus it on a new Windows 10 Cloud variant. ZDNet reports that the codename of Microsoft\u2019s unannounced event is \u201cBespin,\u201d a fictional Star Wars planet that includes a \u201cCloud City.\u201d Rumors of a Windows 10 Cloud variant first surfaced in January, with early copies showing that it will be another simplified version of Windows designed to run Microsoft\u2019s Universal apps from the Windows Store.\nMicrosoft may position Windows 10 Cloud as an alternative to Chrome OS, and as a low-cost or free OS for PC makers willing to build machines that will compete with Chromebooks. ZDNet\u2019s Mary Jo Foley reports that Microsoft may have a new Surface-branded device to show off at its May event, but it\u2019s not clear whether the Surface Pro 5 will be unveiled. \nDigiTimes previously reported that Microsoft will adopt a clamshell design for the Surface Book 2 instead of existing 2-in-1 design, helping to reduce the cost of the laptop. ZDNet claims a Surface Book 2 won\u2019t be ready in time for the May event, but it\u2019s possible Microsoft has a separate Surface device ready to launch instead. If Microsoft is planning a separate event for early May then the company will need to announce it soon, as the Build developers conference is due to start in Seattle on May 10th.\n"}
