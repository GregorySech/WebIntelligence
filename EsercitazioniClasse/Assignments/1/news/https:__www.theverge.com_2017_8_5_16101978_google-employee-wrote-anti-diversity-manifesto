{"title": "A Google employee wrote an anti-diversity \u2018manifesto\u2019 that\u2019s going viral inside the company", "content": " \nA senior software engineer at Google has written a document titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber,\u201d which calls for the company to replace its diversity initiatives with ones that promote \u201cideological diversity,\u201d according to a report from Motherboard. \nMotherboard says that it has only seen screenshots of the 10-page document, which was shared on an internal e-mail list, but has spoken with several Google employees who have read it. Its author argues that the gender gaps at Google are the result of biological differences between men and women, and that the company shouldn\u2019t offer programs that help under-represented groups. The author also alleged that politically conservative employees are discriminated against, and that achieving ideological equality should be a priority. (Conservative political feelings aren\u2019t a protected class in the eyes of anti-discrimination laws like race, religion, age, sex, citizenship, familial status, or one\u2019s disability, or veteran status are.)\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Google for comment, and will update if we hear back.\nNumerous Google employees voiced their outrage over the existence of the document, and indicated that the author\u2019s management chain and HR have been made aware of it. \n\n\nInternal article circulated at work today describing how gender rep gap in SW is due to biological differences btwn men/women.\u2014 Sarah Adams (@sadams007) August 4, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a doc about how inferior women are, then try to be a hero by offering help to save the *vulnerable*     Still shaking in anger.\u2014 Jaana B. Dogan   (@rakyll) August 4, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's rage-read (at work): doc essentially saying that women are unsuited for tech because they like people, whilst men like things.\u2014 Aimee (@aimeeble) August 4, 2017\n\n\n\nEmployees told Motherboard that the document was being shared widely across the company, and that the file was inaccessible because too many people were trying to read it at the same time. As of Saturday afternoon, the document was still live. While the document has been widely condemned, there are some at the company that are receptive to its arguments.  \nGizmodo obtained a full copy of the manifesto, which includes a note at the beginning addressing the response to the document: \u201cI value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don\u2019t endorse using stereotypes.\u201d The author goes on to speak to perceived biases within Google, and how that is detrimental to the company. \nFollowing word of the document, Google\u2019s new VP of Diversity, Danielle Brown, sent a memo to Google employees, saying that she \u201cfound that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender,\u201d and that it\u2019s not a \u201cviewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.\u201d\nShe went on to write that a diverse workplace is a central part of the company\u2019s culture.\nDiversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate. We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul. \nEven as Google has worked to diversify its workforce, it hasn\u2019t been without stumbles. Earlier this year, the US Department of Labor claimed that the company was withholding documentation related to a compliance audit, and that it has been systematically underpaying its female employees (Google has denied these allegations). This isn\u2019t an isolated incident: the entire tech community in Silicon Valley has been scandalized by inadequate gender equality as companies such as Uber and Tesla have recently been the subject of many stories about sexism in the workplace. \nUpdate August 5th, 4:43PM: Gizmodo has obtained a copy of the full document. \nUpdate August 6th, 11:00am: Google\u2019s VP of diversity, Danielle Brown, issued a memo concerning the document. \n"}
