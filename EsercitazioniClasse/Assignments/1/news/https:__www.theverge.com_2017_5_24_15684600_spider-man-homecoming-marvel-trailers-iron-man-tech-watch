{"title": "The latest Spider-Man: Homecoming trailers are all about super-tech", "content": " \nSony has released a pair of new trailers for Spider-Man: Homecoming this morning. Where the first two show off Peter Parker swinging around New York City, fighting low-level crime, dealing with high school, and aspiring to be an Avenger, these two reveal that we\u2019re in for the most technologically focused Spider-Man film yet. \nHalfway through Captain America: Civil War, Tony Stark pays Peter Parker and his Aunt May a visit at their Queens apartment. He tells Peter that he\u2019s in \u201cdire need of an upgrade,\u201d and designs a new, advanced suit. While we saw it in action, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re going to really see what this new suit can do. Here, the costume tells him that he\u2019s got 576 possible web-shooter combinations, showing off an enhanced heads-up display and voice much like Stark\u2019s Iron Man suit possesses. Later, we see that he\u2019s got a parachute, which activates when he\u2019s pulled high into the sky by the Vulture, as well as the small spider-drone we saw in the last trailer. \nWe also get the best sense of Parker\u2019s ambition now, as taking on low-level crime around his neighborhood makes him feel constrained. In one scene, he finds that his suit is far more powerful than he knew, except that there\u2019s a governor installed by Stark, preventing him from using most of its functions. He complains to his friend Ned: \u201cI just feel like I can be doing more.\u201d  \nSony also released a new international trailer for the film, which goes in a slightly different direction: it highlights Michael Keaton\u2019s Vulture and gives us a good idea of his beef with Stark and the Avengers.  \n\n\u201cWe have to pick up after them,\u201d he complains about the rich and the powerful people in the city. We learn that he helped with the cleanup after the New York battle in Avengers. He figures out how to take the Chitauri technology and create his Vulture suit, which he seems to be using to build new weapons and to steal some of Stark\u2019s advanced weapons. \nBetween the two trailers, Homecoming seems to be the most technologically-advanced Spider-Man film to date. Peter Parker has always been a sort of hobbyist inventor: he built his webshooters, his suit, and a whole bunch of other gadgets in the comics, but the earlier movies never highlighted that aspect of his character to this degree. The two trailers show off just how important superpowered tech is becoming in the MCU. Clearly, with great power and cool gadgets comes great responsibility and parental controls. \nUltimately, this is shaping up to look like a film about the Avengers, much in the same way Captain America: Civil War was, but on a much smaller scale. It might not be an Avengers film, but their presence and the fallout from their existence is certainly felt. \nSpider-Man: Homecoming opens on July 7th, 2017.\n\n"}
