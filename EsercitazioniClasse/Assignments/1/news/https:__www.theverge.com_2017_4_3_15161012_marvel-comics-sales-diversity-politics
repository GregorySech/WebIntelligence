{"title": "Of course your comics are political, Marvel", "content": " \nOne of my best friends came to me this morning upset about comments Marvel VP of sales David Gabriel made during the Marvel Retailer Summit. Interviewed by ICv2, Gabriel claimed that diversity was turning readers away and hurting the company\u2019s sales. \u201cThey didn't want female characters out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what we heard, whether we believe that or not.\u201d\nThis is a silly assertion for a number of reasons. Yes, fans of a certain stripe can always be counted on to cry foul about women and people of color taking the spotlight away from the sprawling pantheon of white male characters. But Marvel\u2019s position in the marketplace has also been damaged by the rising cost of monthly issues, the shift toward events that don\u2019t cater to new readers, and the loss of talent like Secret Wars writer Jonathan Hickman, who keep readers loyal and invested. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl isn\u2019t the reason readers are walking away. Books are more expensive overall, and the ones that receive the best marketing aren\u2019t exactly critical smashes. (You can read more about this over on io9.)\nMarvel is caught between the numbers and the zeitgeist\nThe bigger issue here, though, is what these comments (and how they were later clarified to mean essentially, \u201cCalm down! We don\u2019t actually have hard data that says people hate Spider-Gwen! Who would even hate that book?! Please don\u2019t be mad!\u201d) seem to say about how Marvel feels caught between the numbers and the zeitgeist. At the same summit, Marvel editor-in-chief Axel Alonso reportedly said, \u201cThere\u2019s been this massive discussion about inclusion and diversity\u2026 But Marvel is not about politics. We are about telling stories about the world.\u201d That\u2019s illuminating, because it provides a clear picture of intent. Marvel comics are absolutely about telling stories that reflect the world we live in. That doesn\u2019t mean superheroes are going to start fighting against gerrymandering and voter-suppression tactics, but it does mean they\u2019ll showcase black and brown men and women where the publisher deems it profitable. \nAnd since this is a money-making enterprise that feeds not only editorial, but also a studio arm of a massive multinational corporation, that intent forces the company to think about not only catering to new and diverse audiences, but also fans who buy books, movie tickets, and streaming subscriptions. Providing choices across media that simultaneously honor the past and welcome in neophytes is a balancing act that\u2019s built into this already intensely competitive business. A crossover event like Generations might never get the kind of mainstream attention that Netflix\u2019s Luke Cage does, but the aim is the same: draw from yesterday while providing a platform for perspectives that don\u2019t often get to take center stage today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut creating a false distinction between politics and \u201cstories about the world\u201d is a mistake. American superhero comics were political from their earliest days, and Marvel\u2019s are arguably more political than they\u2019ve ever been. Captain America punching Hitler in 1940 is a bold, obvious statement. But exploring the specific experiences of Muslim Americans like Ms. Marvel\u2019s Kamala Khan and queer Latinx Americans like America Chavez is no less political. Discussing how power and identity work in America is an inherently political act, even more so during an era when identity, and stories about it, have become so controversial and polarizing.\nI think the focus needs to be on stories featuring characters who resonate, facing threats that are either fun, or strike at who they are as people. (Or whatever Rocket and Groot qualify as.) That\u2019s hard to do \u2014 though not outright impossible \u2014 when the reining paradigm is \u201cEvents sell,\u201d and new initiatives are designed to create headlines instead of strong narratives. It\u2019s why Cap is a Nazi right now, for reasons too convoluted to go into here. (And yes, I know Marvel is distancing Hydra from its ties with Nazi Germany.)\nSpeaking to why Ms. Marvel found success, writer G. Willow Wilson found that it resonated with an untapped readership:\nA h-u-g-e reason Ms Marvel has struck the chord it has is because it deals with the role of traditionalist faith in the context of social justice, and there was \u2014 apparently \u2014 an untapped audience of people from a wide variety of faith backgrounds who were eager for a story like this.\nThat title never set out to attract think pieces by polemicizing American society, or trailblazing a diversity initiative at Marvel. Rather, its focus on \u201cauthenticity and realism\u201d is what turned Kamala Khan into the Peter Parker of her generation. She\u2019s a regular person who worries about homework and her doting Pakistani parents, on top of being a former Avenger. She\u2019s fully realized and relatable. It\u2019s almost incidental that Kamala has become iconic at a time when Islamophobia has settled in the White House. Showing an ordinary girl growing up in circumstances that don\u2019t mirror the experience of so-called average Americans is radical all on its own.\nInclusion and politics are a big part of what Marvel is\nWhether Marvel brass wants to admit it or not, making diversity a priority over the last several years has made much of what it does political. This is the same company that made an entire event about profiling, literally called Civil War II. If sales are suffering, there are so many other things about Marvel\u2019s approach that could use re-evaluation. Focus more on better stories and less on the next big crossover. Give writers more freedom to experiment. Stop killing beloved characters only to bring them back as zombies. (Sorry, Hulk.) But inclusion and politics are a big part of what Marvel is. We\u2019ve come too far to even entertain the idea of turning back.\n"}
