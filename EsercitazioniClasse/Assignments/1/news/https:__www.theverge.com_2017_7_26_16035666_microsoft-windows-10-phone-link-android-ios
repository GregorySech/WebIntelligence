{"title": "Windows 10\u2019s latest preview links an Android phone to a PC", "content": " \nMicrosoft first revealed its plans to bring Android and iPhone phones closer to Windows 10 earlier this year, and now the company is letting public testers play with the new features. In a new Windows 10 preview (build 16251) released today, Android users will be able to test a new \u201cMicrosoft Apps\u201d application that links a phone to a PC. Microsoft hasn\u2019t revealed when iPhone users will be able to test similar functionality, so it\u2019s Android only for now.\nThe link will enable new cross-device features, including the ability to share a link from a mobile directly to a Windows 10 PC. It\u2019s the first of many features Microsoft is planning to closely align Android and iOS to Windows 10, and in the future the company will also allow apps to directly share contents to and from PCs, alongside the ability to copy and paste content from a universal clipboard.\nAlongside these new phone features, Microsoft is also enhancing Cortana in this latest Windows 10 preview. You\u2019ll be able to view Cortana results within the digital assistant, and without having to launch a web browser. This works with movies, stock prices, weather, flight status, and other searches that have quick answers. Cortana will also now support \u201cHey Cortana, restart PC\u201d or shutdown, lock, or simply sign out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
