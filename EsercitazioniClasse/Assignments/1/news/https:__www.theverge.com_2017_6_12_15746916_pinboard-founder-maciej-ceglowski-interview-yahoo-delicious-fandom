{"title": "The founder of Pinboard on why understanding fandom is good for business", "content": " \nSubscription-based bookmarking site Pinboard is a one-man operation, founded and maintained by former Yahoo engineer and slightly eccentric Silicon Valley figure Maciej Ceg\u0142owski. Last week, it managed to acquire its longtime rival, Delicious, for a paltry $35,000, in what appeared on its surface to be a standard story of dog-eat-dog.\nBut behind every boring story is a smaller, more interesting story. Delicious may be largely lost to the internet, but it leaves behind a valuable lesson on understanding users \u2014 specifically those that belong to a massive online subculture.\nDelicious\u2019 road to decline was mapped by The Daily Dot, tracing its downfall back to a series of bigger acquisitions. First, the site was bought by Yahoo in 2005, and redesigned in 2009 to make it cleaner and more appealing for Yahoo\u2019s then-huge audience. Making the site\u2019s millions of bookmarks easier to sort through made it more accessible, but it also turned off older users who were accustomed to hiding in the haystack.\n\u201cAt the time,\u201d Ceg\u0142owski told The Verge in a phone call, \u201cI asked [Delicious co-founder] Joshua Schachter\u2019s blessing to do a version of what it used to look like, and spin it off as a product. I tried to target it at people who really cared more about privacy and might not want to share as many of their bookmarks.\u201d  \na former delicious community manager helped its rival get off the ground\nIn 2011, after Delicious\u2019 value had plummeted, Yahoo sold the site to YouTube property AVOS, which redesigned it again, rendering it unusable for one of its largest established user bases \u2014 fan-fic writers. Slash fic, or fan fiction about romantic relationships between popular characters, is traditionally denoted with the / mark it takes its name from. E.g. Steve Rogers / Bucky Barnes, or Hermione Granger / Harry Potter. The AVOS redesign made it impossible to tag or search for anything with a / in it. A single symbol turned into a huge opportunity for Delicious\u2019 growing rival, Pinboard. \nCeg\u0142owski was only positioned to notice this with the help of former Delicious community manager Britta Gustafson. She taught him about fandom, and how fans had once made Delicious\u2019 platform work for them as a way to organize hundreds of thousands of pieces of fan fiction. \u201cAs community manager,\u201d Gustafson explained to The Verge in an email, \u201cI heard a lot of friendly and thorough bug reports from fandom users, and I got curious about what they were bookmarking. Learning about it showed me that the fandom community was really interesting, lively, and thoughtful \u2014 a whole secret world of women like me who liked internet stuff, feminism, queerness, science fiction. I was just an amused and impressed observer.\u201d Gustafson began participating in fandom herself, and encouraged Ceg\u0142owski to embrace the fandom community.\n\n\nFanfic people, can you draft a list of your 'must have' features for me to look at, maybe as a Google doc? I'll implement what I can for you\u2014 Pinboard (@Pinboard) September 28, 2011\n\n\n\nAs a token of thanks, Ceg\u0142owski has given her control of the now-useless Delicious social media accounts. She posts from them for fun, but notes that the end of Delicious as a fandom community is a bit of a soft spot. As with many corporate redesigns of once-niche products, \u201c[It] hurts to see a thing you built turn into a weird undead zombie.\u201d \nTo learn more about how and why fandom became central to Pinboard, and what Ceg\u0142owski thinks the tech industry can learn from this weird little business story, I spoke to him about his experiences meeting fans, \u201cbuilding a habitat\u201d for them, and being upfront about taking their money.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nI saw that you\u2019re going to preserve Delicious as it is but not allow new activity. Why not shut it down?\nThe biggest reason for me is that I\u2019ve been friends with Joshua [Schachter], the co-founder, and a bunch of the early Delicious people since forever. My roommate when I lived in New York was Peter Gadjokov, who was the other co-founder. This was their beloved project and I didn\u2019t want to see it disappear or be bought by someone who wanted to use it strictly for SEO or marketing stuff. I thought it was really important given the amount of history and the special affection that some people have for this site, that it not end up in a startup graveyard.\nI\u2019m an archivist. That\u2019s what Pinboard is for, so the idea that these sites just go offline and take millions and millions of pages of bookmarks with them is one of the things I hate the most. I\u2019m glad to get the chance to preserve something that changed my life in a number of ways. \nPinboard for a while had this competition with Delicious as a main part of its brand \u2014 on Twitter, you wrote a lot of jokes about Delicious, lots of taunts aimed at Yahoo or AVOS \u2014 now that that\u2019s over, who\u2019s next? \nYeah, it\u2019s really weird for me, because especially at the outset I felt like I was a flea on the elephant. I was trying to suck a few dozen customers away from this enormous Yahoo-funded giant and the idea that I could not just compete with this site, but actually buy it, never entered my mind. So I\u2019m in a bit of a Twilight Zone feeling. \n\n\nAt one point, Avos was spending $40K/month on AWS hosting, and their total *lifetime* revenue was $7K. I wish I\u2019d made fun of them harder\u2014 Pinboard (@Pinboard) June 3, 2017\n\n\n\nI feel like I won the war so thoroughly that I don\u2019t really know what to do next. I would love to take down Pocket and I would love to take down Diigo. Pocket is losing a lot of money, and Diigo is kind of a strange, weird longterm competitor. Actually, I think there\u2019s room for a lot of different bookmarking sites and I like that there\u2019s competitors, I hope that they stick around. \nThere\u2019s all these little niche areas in bookmarking that I want to see be occupied by people like me, who are just kind of living from it. There are a lot of ways you can earn a living but there\u2019s not a lot of ways you can make millions. Unfortunately what ends up happening is that people start with a niche, but then they decide they want to grow the business to be like Pinterest and that never seems to work, maybe once in a decade. \nI saw that you tweeted something at Flickr, is that another rivalry? \nIt\u2019s not so much a rivalry, it\u2019s just a regret. There\u2019s this whole generation of startups that got bought at the same time by Yahoo. Upcoming, which Andy Baio was able to buy back and he\u2019s running it again, which is super. And then Delicious, obviously. And then Flickr, which was a pioneer and it was really a beloved website and it still kind of is. If you could have Flickr back the way it used to be and run competently, everybody would be on there right now. I think it would be wonderful if the old Flickr crew could get the site back and run it the way they wanted to. \n\u201cYahoo just doesn\u2019t understand anything about the sites they bought years and years ago.\u201d\nYahoo just doesn\u2019t understand anything about the sites they bought years and years ago, so they might as well just give them back to people who know what they\u2019re actually for. \nPinboard has a reputation for being a platform for fandom. Would you say the platform itself also has fans, in the way that like, Tumblr has fans? \nThere\u2019s been fan-fic written about Pinboard, which I thought was awesome. I think that\u2019s the litmus test. I don\u2019t know if it goes that far, but fans have been really nice to me and they\u2019ve responded in a very friendly way to my overtures so I would say I get along with them. I try to understand their specific needs and uses maybe more than some other sites do. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinboard feature request Google Doc.\n\n\nSince you\u2019re pretty publicly the sole personality behind this site, do you have a lot of personal interactions with users? \nFor the last six months I\u2019ve been running the Tech Solidarity group, which is a political activist thing. I\u2019ve been having meet ups in different cities, trying to get tech people involved in areas where we can help locally with volunteering and also trying to do some broader political organizing in the tech industry. In the course of those meetings I\u2019ve actually met a lot of Pinboard users and a lot of fandom people who use Pinboard. So that\u2019s been a very funny side effect of this sudden political activism is that I get to meet people who use the site all over the country. Some people I\u2019ve had Twitter relationships with forever, I\u2019ll get to put a face on a Twitter account.\nCould you give some specific examples of how you communicate with fans or collaborate with them? \nThe biggest example was this giant Google Doc they made for me in 2011. That was after yet another [Delicious] redesign that turned off a lot of essential fan features and they ended up just creating a collaborative design document that I could work from. So that was really the most amazing example for me, of cooperation. Whenever I see Pinboard users in fandom, we talk about things they\u2019d like to see on the site or integrations. I really like the fandom community, they\u2019re one of the most friendly groups to support that use Pinboard. \nThe more fans I can get on the site the better, just from a selfish perspective as someone who has to do customer support. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinboard feature request Google Doc.\n\n\nFandom, generally speaking, is a little complicated in that people who are really enthusiastic about things also have very strong opinions. Do you ever find it hard to keep up with requests? \nI find that people are really understanding about it being just my solo project. So even if I can\u2019t get stuff happening that they want, they\u2019re pretty patient. Hopefully there\u2019s some credibility at this point. They know I\u2019m going to keep the site going without changing it majorly. I\u2019m going to respect the way that people use it now and not try to go for millions of dollars or anything like that. \nPinboard anticipated these complaints that fans had about Delicious. Can you explain a little bit about how you came to know about these things? Were you personally involved in fandom? \nNo, no, I was a terrible person. I didn\u2019t know anything. I made fun of fans and fan fiction. I was awful and Britta Gustafson, when she was Delicious community manager around 2005, told me all these cool tagging things that fans were doing on Delicious. The tagging system is really freeform, it\u2019s not designed to do the things that fans made it do, but by collaborating they came up with all these inventive things that made it possible to search for fan-fic. I was just amazed by the level of collaboration and inventiveness on their part, so I remembered that. When I started Pinboard I really wanted to get the fandom community onto Pinboard, because I thought it was really cool the way they just built out the site to do their own thing. \n\u201cI was a terrible person. I didn\u2019t know anything. I made fun of fans and fan fiction.\u201d\nWhen I saw that they were freaking out about the redesign that AVOS was doing, that was kind of the moment. I already knew who they were and how they used the site, I still didn\u2019t realize to what extent they were a subculture of their own with their own lingo. Britta helped me, I learned that. I give her all the credit for broadening my mind about how fandom was using these sites. I\u2019m a really big fan of the open web, of people using the web to create things and not just looking at stuff. So from that perspective I think fandom is one of the most amazing phenomena out there and I\u2019m honored they\u2019re using my site. \nWhen they did that doc for me I was amazed at the level of friendliness and cooperation. I just had never seen anonymous users working together in that kind of spirit, and only later did I learn that fandom is predominantly women. That\u2019s another reason that I\u2019m happy that Pinboard has this subculture using it. When I was back in a frame of mind of being like \u201cOh, fandom, haha,\u201d [Britta] was like \u201cWell, you know, fandom is an underground training course in feminism for a lot of young women.\u201d You go into it because you\u2019re into the stories, you\u2019re into the writing, but as a side effect you learn a lot of stuff from other women in the community. That stuck with me.\n\n\nJust a gentle reminder to fanfic people - / tag works just fine on Pinboard :-)\u2014 Pinboard (@Pinboard) September 27, 2011\n\n\n\nThe reason this story is so interesting to me is because I think lots of entertainment brands have already recognized the benefit of having large fanbases but I haven\u2019t seen it as much on the tech side or developer side. Is that something you\u2019ve noticed? \nI live in San Francisco, and there\u2019s a really good website that tells you how to build a garden that attracts bees. I didn\u2019t know this, but there\u2019s dozens of species of wild bees, not just the ones we\u2019re used to, but lots of odd-looking little ones. They have these instructions on how to make a bee-friendly garden and if you do all this stuff they\u2019ll show up and make their hives. I\u2019ve thought about Pinboard as trying to create a habitat for different kinds of users and make it useful, and then letting things happen on their own. \n\u201cI\u2019m a really big fan of the open web, of people using the web to create things.\u201d\nWhat I\u2019ve seen with fandom is that these tech companies really try to co-opt them. They try to lock them into using platforms a certain way. Amazon made this attempt to have people doing fan-fic, basically moving fan-fic onto the Kindle ecosystem, but then they had all these rules. You couldn\u2019t use certain characters in certain ways, they basically tried to rule it with a heavy hand. Fans have been burned a lot by people trying to get money out of them, in those ways and control what they do. Of course, I\u2019m trying to get money out of them but hopefully I\u2019m being transparent about it. I\u2019m really adamant that I don\u2019t understand the ways people use my site and I want to learn from them. \n\n\n\n"}
