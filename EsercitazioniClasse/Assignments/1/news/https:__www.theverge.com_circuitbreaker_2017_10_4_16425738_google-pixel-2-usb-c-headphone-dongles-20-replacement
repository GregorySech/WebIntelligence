(iPhone users have their own option in the almost-as-bad $35 Belkin 3.5mm Audio + Charge Rockstar. Its most redeeming quality at this point seems to be that it\u2019s cheaper than Google\u2019s option.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\nAnd while there are plenty of far cheaper options around on dongle sites like Amazon, most of those come from sketchy-looking sellers with poor ratings, which makes it kind of a crapshoot on if the dongle will even work.\nGiven that more and more phones are switching over to USB-C, odds are that we\u2019ll start seeing more reputable sellers with cheaper adapters soon. For now, just don\u2019t lose your free dongle.\n"}
