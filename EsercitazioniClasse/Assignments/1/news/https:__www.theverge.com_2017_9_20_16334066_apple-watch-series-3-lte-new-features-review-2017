{"title": "Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE review: missed connections", "content": " \nWriter\u2019s note: As of October 9, 2017, this review has been updated to include more information about the Watch\u2019s connectivity issues, based on follow-up testing that was done after Apple issued a software fix. \nHow much are you willing to pay for a gadget that offers intermittent convenience? How much are you willing to pay for what feels like a little bit of insurance, just in case you need cellular connectivity and your phone isn\u2019t nearby or charged?\nThose are the questions you need to ask yourself when you consider buying the Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE. The biggest difference between the Apple Watch Series 3 and older Apple Watches is that this model comes with the option of a built-in cellular modem. That means that even if your phone isn\u2019t nearby, and even if your Watch isn\u2019t connected to a known Wi-Fi network, you should still be able to make and receive calls and messages on the Watch.\nthe Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE promises an \u201cuntethered\u201d experience, but it didn\u2019t always work\nIt\u2019s the promise of an \u201cuntethered\u201d experience, one that other smartwatch makers have attempted before. No one will argue the fact that sometimes our smartphones can be as much of a burden as they are incredibly useful and beneficial. A smartwatch with LTE will, in theory, let you go for a run, buy a coffee, splash in the ocean, or simply step away from the phone and still be connected. A smartwatch with LTE will, in theory, let you call a ride home when your smartphone dies before your watch does. \nIn theory. In reality, my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE failed at the LTE part. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 3 starts shipping this Friday, September 22nd. The version with LTE costs $399. The Series 3 without LTE, which still has GPS, waterproofing, and the same improved processor, starts at $329. The Apple Watch Series 2 is going away, but the basic Apple Watch Series 1 \u2014 no GPS, no waterproofing mechanism \u2014 is still around, and starts at $249. \nIf you\u2019re intrigued by the Watch with LTE, you\u2019re also going to have to factor in a monthly cellular cost. You don\u2019t need a separate plan or phone number for the Watch, but you will need to pay a separate fee. All four of the big wireless carriers in the US \u2014 AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon \u2014 will offer Apple Watch plans, and they\u2019re all $10 per month on top of your phone service plan. In most cases, you\u2019ll get the first few months free. (Sprint\u2019s is technically $15 per month, but you get $5 off if you enroll in auto-pay.)\nFactor in an extra $10 per month if you want an Apple Watch with LTE\nThere\u2019s some fine print worth examining, too. For example, Sprint\u2019s plan includes unlimited data, but other carriers will base your Apple Watch data usage on the smartphone plan you already have. So if you\u2019re an AT&T Unlimited Plus or AT&T Unlimited Choice customer, your Apple Watch Series 3 data will also be unlimited, but if you\u2019re on an AT&T Mobile Share Advantage plan, the data from the Watch will count against your monthly bucket. \nThere are some activation fees involved, like the $30 activation fee through Verizon, but in most cases it\u2019s waived. Also, the Apple Watch Series 3 doesn\u2019t work with prepaid wireless plans. It doesn\u2019t work from country to country. You can\u2019t use something like Project Fi, Google\u2019s own wireless service, as your cell service on the Watch. \nIn general, it\u2019s safe to assume that having cell service on your Apple Watch isn\u2019t totally unlike having cell service on your iPad, provided your iPad is using the same number as your phone. But since the SIM card is built into the Watch, you can\u2019t swap it out for a different one.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the outside, you wouldn\u2019t really know this is a new Apple Watch. It looks just like the Series 2 model, and the Series 1 before that. It\u2019s a square, metal watch with a lovely OLED display that slopes gently into the watch casing. The Series 3 is a tiny bit thicker on the underside than the Series 2 watch, and there are different color options for certain metals (as well as new bands). But otherwise, the design is the same. \nWith one exception: the red dot. The crown on the side of the Series 3 LTE smartwatch has a red dot on it. Apple has said this is to differentiate the Series 3 LTE Watch from other models that don\u2019t have cellular capabilities. \nApple Watch Series 3 looks essentially the same\nIt\u2019s a befuddling design choice, because once you, as the customer, have gone through the process of buying a $399 smartwatch and paying a monthly fee, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need another reminder of what you\u2019re paying for. (Oh yeah! My smartwatch has LTE!) The red dot, then, is supposed to communicate to the outside world that you have an LTE-equipped Watch. But again, I don\u2019t see a whole lot of value in that. Maybe having a Watch with a red dot helps during the retail or resale process, to prove that it\u2019s the LTE model. Otherwise it just seems unnecessary. \nMore important are the guts of the Watch. The Series 3 Watch (both with LTE and without) has a faster processor, one that enables the Watch to perform 70 percent faster at common tasks. Based on my own experience, switching between apps, opening up calendar appointments, and saving workouts felt faster. You might remember that the very first Apple Watch was painfully slow, especially when it came to launching or running third-party apps. The Series 3 Watch switches between tasks faster than the White House switches communications directors. \nIn an engineering workaround that follows last year\u2019s quirky water-expulsion method, the antenna of the Series 3 Watch is built directly into the display, something that Apple declined to share more technical details on. Other smartwatch makers have put the LTE antennae in the watch\u2019s strap, but that makes it impossible to change straps; whereas the Apple Watch has swappable straps. In addition, the Apple Watch Series 3 has an altimeter, for elevation tracking. And there\u2019s the option for the electronic SIM card, which is what enables LTE. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Watch\u2019s connectivity issues made sending messages difficult.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Siri was also impossible when the Watch wouldn\u2019t connect to the network.\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I start with the connectivity issues with this Watch? \nIt became apparent after my first full day using the Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE that something wasn\u2019t right. My review Watch was paired with an iPhone 8 and was on an AT&T wireless plan. In one of my initial tests, I went for a walk with the phone on airplane mode, and tried to send text messages and use Siri to initiate phone calls through the Watch. Those didn\u2019t work. I tried asking Siri basic questions. That didn\u2019t work. Siri also wasn\u2019t \u201ctalking back\u201d to me, something that\u2019s supposed to be a new feature on the Series 3 Watch. \nPhone calls did sometimes work from the Watch, but I had to manually tap through my contacts or recent calls list on the Watch and initiate the call that way. (Calls through Bluetooth headphones sound good, but the Watch\u2019s built-in audio isn\u2019t ideal for extended conversations.) By 11:42 that morning, after 60 minutes of working out with LTE, multiple attempts to use Siri, and two seven-minute phone calls, the Watch\u2019s battery had drained to 27 percent. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Watch LTE connectivity (simulated screen, times and battery life don\u2019t match actual experience)\n\n\n\nSo Apple replaced my original review unit with a second Series 3 Watch, also connected to AT&T\u2019s wireless network. Siri was now audibly responding, which the company later said was attributable to the fact that the first batch of preproduction units hadn\u2019t been set up properly with Siri. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the LTE connectivity issues went away. On more than one occasion, I detached myself from the phone, traveled blocks away from my home or office, and watched the Watch struggle to connect to LTE. It would appear to pick up a single bar of some random Wi-Fi signal, and hang on that, rather than switching to LTE. \nI actually went surfing, in the ocean, wearing the Apple Watch, hoping to replicate the glorious ad that Apple put out of a woman surfing and receiving a phone call on her Apple Watch. (Is this glorious? Real surfers would disagree. And I looked like a serious kook shouting \u201cHey Siri!\u201d at my wrist in the ocean.) I wasn\u2019t very far from shore, but the Watch vacillated between one bar of service and being disconnected entirely. I did manage to make one phone call from a surfboard. That was kind of wild. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way the LTE version of the Watch is supposed to work is that it will \u201chand off\u201d from your smartphone\u2019s connectivity to whatever other type of connectivity is available. In some cases, like when you\u2019re in a place with a Wi-Fi network you\u2019ve connected to before, this will be Wi-Fi. In other cases, like when you\u2019re out without your phone, and you\u2019re nowhere near a known Wi-Fi network, this will be LTE. \nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect it might take a minute for the Apple Watch to \u201cfind\u201d LTE after you\u2019ve walked away from your phone. It\u2019s not reasonable for this to take many minutes or not work at all. This almost makes me wish there was a way to actively turn off Wi-Fi on the Watch, so it would just default to LTE. But that\u2019s also another step that I, the wearer, the person-who-is-not-wearing-it-wrong, would have to take.\nApple eventually issued a statement acknowledging the cellular connectivity problems\nThe day before publication of this review, Apple sent a statement about this, saying that the company discovered \u201cthat when Apple Watch Series 3 joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks without connectivity, it may at times prevent the watch from using cellular. We are investigating a fix for a future software release.\u201d\nBut we don\u2019t know when that software update is coming. And the company still hasn\u2019t explained why streaming Apple Music from the Watch, something that would be one of the biggest value adds of LTE on a smartwatch, won\u2019t roll out until next month.\nUpdate, October 9, 2017: On October 4th, two weeks after this review published, Apple released an update to the watchOS 4 issue that included a fix for the WiFi-to-LTE connectivity issues. After five days of retesting the same Series 3 loaner watch with the new software, I\u2019ve determined that the Watch works much better than it did before. I\u2019ve made five different phone calls through the watch without the iPhone anywhere close to the watch, and all phone calls went through successfully. These calls were made both in the city of San Francisco, in exact spots where I\u2019d had trouble before, and in the suburbs. I also sent and received text messages through the watch, including an Amber alert that went out to cell phones this weekend. \nIt\u2019s not a completely seamless experience, though. On a couple of occasions I saw a red \u201cX\u201d and \u201cDisconnected\u201d before the watch connected to LTE and placed a call, which I\u2019m told is the way it\u2019s supposed to work. Siri, on occasion, still took several seconds to respond to commands. So while the Series 3 Watch now works for me as promised, I still think it offers an intermittent convenience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lauren Goode / The Verge\n\n\nNot surprisingly, using LTE impacted battery life on the Series 3, although the second review unit showed battery life that was much more in line with what I expected. We spent a whole morning shooting video last week, with the Watch operating independently of the phone \u2014 about three hours of intermittent LTE usage. By noon, the Watch had drained to 30 percent. So I had to charge it later that afternoon, but that was still better than the experience I had with the first unit. \nOver the weekend, I had my iPhone with me most of the time, and the Watch lasted from Saturday morning through early Sunday afternoon. So without the strain of LTE, the Series 3 Watch clearly matches the battery life of the Series 2 model. On Monday, as I wrote this, I\u2019ve attempted to use LTE on the Series 3 Watch a handful of times, but have mostly been in range of the phone. It\u2019s 6PM, and the Watch still has 59 percent battery life left. \nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that Apple\u2019s aggressive estimates for Series 3 battery life are based on 30-minute workouts while connected to LTE. So long-distance runners or hikers may find themselves sorely disappointed by the battery life if you go out for a multi-hour workout while the Watch is connected to both GPS and LTE. In fact, you\u2019d probably want to go into the Watch\u2019s settings and turn off cellular data until you need it, which in some ways defeats the purpose of having an LTE-connected watch. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one new aspect of the Apple Watch that\u2019s worth two thumbs up, and that\u2019s the new watchOS 4 software. Luckily, this is something that will roll out to all Apple Watches, not just Series 3 Watches. If there\u2019s one thing that can be said about the Apple Watch, it\u2019s that Apple has consistently upgraded its software each year to make this tiny touchscreen a lot easier to use. And this year is no exception. \nSome of these updates are cosmetic. For example, there are new watchfaces, including a Toy Story watchface and a kaleidoscope one. Others are more functional: one of the new watchfaces prioritizes Siri. It shows a tiny Siri button, and below it, things like calendar appointments, weather and stock updates, and wallet notifications appear throughout the day. \nThe Watch\u2019s app dock has been redesigned again. Now when you press the flat button on the side of the smartwatch, shortcuts to apps appear in a vertical format, which means you scroll up and down through them rather than swiping from right to left. I actually liked the side-to-side layout more, but I\u2019m getting used to the vertical one. And, this is a small thing, but the keypad on the Watch\u2019s lock screen now features bigger, bolder keys, which might just be my favorite feature of the software redesign. \nNot surprisingly, the biggest updates to the Watch\u2019s software have to do with health and fitness tracking, since that\u2019s one of the big draws for people who buy and wear an Apple Watch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple watch heart rate monitor (simulated screen)\n\n\n\nI spent less of my time testing the workout features of this year\u2019s Apple Watch than I have in years past, simply because I had to troubleshoot so many other issues. But I was able to hike, spin, swim, surf, and test out a couple other activities on the Series 3 Watch, which, like last year\u2019s model, has GPS. I liked the daily and weekly notifications that the Watch now sends. These are supposed to encourage you to get moving each day, to match your activity from the day before, or to let you know that you beat your daily \u201cMove\u201d goal three times the week before. \nWithin the list of workout options, there\u2019s now a high-intensity workout option, as well as a multi-sport feature that lets you stop one workout and start another without having to go through the \u201csave\u201d process first. And the swim modes now track what kind of stroke you\u2019re using when you swim laps, though it doesn\u2019t appear until after you\u2019ve completed the workout. \nApple Watch will now show you if your heart rate spikes \u2014 even when you\u2019re not working out \nSpeaking of saving a workout: when you finish a workout on the Watch now, there\u2019s only one option, Done. The Apple Watch used to offer two options, Save and Discard. I suspect some people were accidentally discarding workouts when they were finished, instead of saving them. This is a much simpler way to do it. \nBut the watchOS 4 updates to heart rate tracking are really the most noteworthy. Any Apple Watch with heart rate sensors will now record your resting heart rate, your average walking heart rate, your recovery heart rate, and, if you opt in, any spikes in heart rate that occur when the Watch thinks you\u2019re not working out. \nThe idea behind this is that any irregularities in heart rate could indicate a bigger problem, though Apple has been careful to not say it is diagnosing anything with Apple Watch. The company has also said it\u2019s working with Stanford University and telemedicine company American Well to run studies and determine if it can accurately detect cardiac arrhythmias. This is all part of a larger effort in the wearables space to provide more value through software and data processing, since the hardware can only be and do so much. Apple is not the only company attempting this, with companies like Fitbit also exploring more medical use cases.  \nAgain, all of these workout and heart rate features are being pushed out with watchOS 4, and are not specific to the Apple Watch Series 3. Update: Apple confirmed that these new heart rate features will only work on Apple Watch Series 1, 2, and 3 \u2014 not the original Apple Watch. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Apple Watch with built-in cellular capabilities, should, in theory, prompt existential questions about what a smartwatch can be. Is it no longer just an accessory to the iPhone? Is it still an accessory to the phone, but a much more independent gadget? Is a cellular modem on the wrist something that could eventually replace the cell service we have on the phone? Does any of that even make sense considering that you still have to have an iPhone to set up an Apple Watch? \nIt\u2019s hard to philosophize about what an LTE smartwatch means if it doesn\u2019t work\nBut in order for that philosophizing to occur, something else has to happen first: the thing has to work. Apple promises magic over and over again with its products, and in this case, that magic is supposed to happen when you step outside without your phone and can rest easy knowing that important calls and messages will still go through. \nYou can\u2019t rest easy with the Apple Watch 3 yet, because that seamlessness, that so-called magic, isn\u2019t there. The stutters during the handoff from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to LTE shouldn\u2019t happen. The music streaming? It isn\u2019t there yet. A built-in podcast streaming option? Also not there. A reliable Siri? Nope, not in my experience. \nGiven that Apple is also selling a version of the Apple Watch Series 3 without LTE, it makes me wonder why the company didn\u2019t just announce the Series 3, with its faster processor and outspoken Siri, on its own, with an LTE version \u201cto come\u201d later, along with music streaming. Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn\u2019t function like it was supposed to, I can\u2019t recommend buying it \u2014 and paying the monthly cell fee \u2014 based on promises. I know I\u2019m not.\nWriter\u2019s note: As mentioned earlier in the review, the Apple Watch Series 3 also comes without LTE, and we have not yet had the opportunity to review a non-LTE version of the new Watch. We may update this review to include more information about a non-LTE model once we use it. It\u2019s worth noting that during the two days of testing when the Series 3 LTE Watch was mostly connected to an iPhone, it performed like we\u2019d expect an Apple Watch to perform.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nVerge Score\n\n\nApple Watch Series 3 (with LTE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nOption for LTE\nFaster processor\nwatchOS 4 (not specific to this hardware)\n\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nCellular connectivity problems\nApple Music streaming not working yet\nUnreliable Siri\nNotable battery drain with LTE\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $399.00 from Apple\nBuy for $399.00 from B&H\n\n\n\n \n"}
