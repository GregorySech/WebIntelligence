{"title": "Gallery view", "content": " \nFor 13 years, the Mike Weiss Gallery was a thriving member of the Chelsea art world, hosting over 100 exhibitions and participating in local group shows. But in October of last year, Weiss and his wife Virginia Martinsen decided to shutter their physical location. Rent was rising, nearby construction was becoming a major headache, and the ever-expanding number of art fairs was drawing attention and customers away from galleries. The woes of the Weiss Gallery are widespread. From London to Los Angeles, galleries that survived the decades of market crashes and changing tastes have gone out of business in the last few years. \nLingering contractions from the economic crisis of 2009 means the traditional art market, especially smaller galleries, has seen precious little growth over the last decade. But just as importantly, Weiss says, they felt the way in which people discovered and purchased art had shifted. \u201cWe used to get a thousand people on a Saturday,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cThe walk-in traffic dropped off.\u201d The ascendancy of the internet, the couple believed, had transformed buyers\u2019 behavior. \u201cIt used to be unthinkable that a collector would buy a work without seeing it in person,\u201d said Martinsen. \u201cOver the last few years it was almost the opposite. People would buy work from the gallery online and not come in for the show.\u201d While the growth in the traditional art market has been flat, the world of online art sales is booming.\nJust five years ago, many gallery owners and auction houses were still skeptical of bringing collections online. \u201cThere [are] many sites like Artsy that want to take your inventory and put it online. In an older period, that would be called \u2018burning your inventory,\u2019\u201d wrote veteran art critic Anthony Haden-Guest in 2014. The value of a painting or sculpture is often tied to its singularity \u2014 a unique object that is inaccessible to all but its owner. Creating a digital version anyone could copy or distribute undercut your control. \u201cThe idea of selling on the net is not working,\u201d Haden-Guest wrote.\n\u201cThere [are] many sites like Artsy that want to take your inventory and put it online. In an older period, that would be called \u2018burning your inventory.\u2019\u201d \nNathan Ritterpusch, who has been making a living as a painter for the last two decades, agrees. His work hangs in galleries and is sold by major auction houses. For many years, he kept it offline. \"The fear was that putting my art online would devalue the work. That was certainly the case with Facebook. And I was told by the gallery that I worked with at the time not to,\u201d says Ritterpusch. \u201cThere is a very specific way in which you introduce work, and you have to convey a sense of privilege to certain people. Maintaining a sense of scarcity and uniqueness is crucial.\"\nBut that dynamic is changing quickly. Today, transactions conducted over the internet are helping to power record-breaking sales, even as the merchants behind them are looking to downsize their physical footprint. Christie\u2019s, one of the largest auction houses in the world, announced in March of this year that it would close down a space in London and shrink another in Amsterdam while ramping up online auctions. \u201cA lot of gallery owners are asking why they should commit to space when rent is so high and people can find you easily online,\u201d says Carlo McCormick, a veteran art critic and curator. \u201cEven in a successful gallery, most of the time, the space is empty.\u201d\nThe move online has been one of the critical forces shaping the industry over the last decade, a disruption that happened slowly, and then suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge change in what galleries have done. It\u2019s been the biggest trend in the art market, next to art fairs, over the last ten years,\u201d says Clare McAndrew, a leading art market economist. \u201cThe biggest driver is the wider acceptance of e-commerce. This is how collectors buy everything else, so why not art?\u201d After closing their physical space, Weiss and Martinsen focused on crafting an online business, Gates of the West, and cultivating their brand through social media.\nThis new paradigm is powering the success of Artsy, a New York City-based startup that this morning announced it had raised $50 million in fresh venture capital. The company\u2019s offering is far more open and approachable than the traditional art world. Every piece is available through a search engine that can filter by style, time period, or price. The service uses algorithms to understand what kind of art appeals to users and then recommends other works they might enjoy, or buy. Instead of the rarefied, sterile walls of a Chelsea gallery, users swipe to browse. Artsy makes shopping for art as unassuming, and as pedestrian, as using Tinder.\n\nThe world of fine art, like music or film, typically has several layers between the creator and customer. Sure, some wealthy people mingle socially with artists, visit their studios, and purchase directly. But for most artists, getting in front of clients with serious money means finding a gallery to represent them. For decades, galleries were the physical retailers that powered the industry. They gave artwork a carefully curated exhibition space visited by a steady stream of potential buyers. Recent estimates put the number of galleries in the US at around 5,000.\nIn the past, collectors who wanted to educate themselves about art and refine their tastes often turned to advisors. These were industry insiders paid to school collectors in what was hip, get them invited to exclusive showings, and recommend emerging artists whose work would be appreciated in cultural cache or price. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing about the art world \u2014 most people don\u2019t trust their own taste,\u201d said McAndrew, who authors a widely read annual report on the state of the art market. \u201cWhen you start investing a sizable portion of your wealth into these works, you want some reassurance you\u2019re making the right decision.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing about the art world \u2014 most people don\u2019t trust their own taste.\u201d\nEven the well-heeled say that walking into a gallery can be an intimidating experience. \u201cI don\u2019t look like the art world\u2019s dream buyer,\u201d says Alan Tisch, a 29-year-old startup CEO and a member of the \u00fcber-wealthy Tisch family, which has an entire wing of the Metropolitan Museum dedicated in its name. \u201cIf I walk into a gallery on a Saturday afternoon wearing sandals, sweatpants, and a T-shirt, you kind of feel shunned. The vibe is, \u2018What are you doing here, you don\u2019t belong. This art isn\u2019t for you.\u2019\u201d\nThrough its website and mobile app, Artsy offers users an opportunity browse through its catalog of artwork without ever stepping into a physical gallery. If you create a profile, Artsy will send you personalized recommendations about new artists you might like, or alerts about works being put up for sale. Once you sign up, you can follow institutions like museums, galleries, auction houses, and art fairs. The system can send you email alerts and push notifications about upcoming events and sales. You can also favorite individual works, the equivalent of a \u201cLike\u201d on Facebook or thumbs-up on Pandora. All that data is used by Artsy\u2019s algorithms to decide which art and artists it should recommend to you. \nFor many young collectors, this process of self-guided education is preferable to hiring an advisor or browsing the gallery circuit. \u201cEven galleries I visited for openings and events, even places where I know the gallerist, even then, you don\u2019t always feel welcome. If you get a \u2018hi\u2019 in a New York gallery, consider yourself lucky,\u201d says Kinjil Mathur, the chief marketing officer at Squarespace. \u201cBeing able to do your own research on Artsy is incredibly helpful. You can contextualize a work in a way that just isn\u2019t possible in the physical world.\u201d \nTisch, who has been using the service for about four years, says he messages galleries through the mobile app when he\u2019s interested in a piece. They get to see his collector profile, which typically elicits a much warmer response. \u201cWith Artsy you can communicate with galleries without the feeling of anxiety,\u201d he says.\n\nIn some ways, visual art seems like the perfect product to sell over the internet. Paintings and photographs can be easily shared on a website or over email, and even sculptures can often be captured and shared as flat images. What\u2019s more, flash sales and auctions, two staples of e-commerce, are common practice in the art market. Yet, even late into the 2000s, the fine art market was largely absent online. Why was it so difficult to convince galleries to bring their works online? \nThe answer is volatility. Unlike a cast-iron pan, a paperback book, or any of the myriad items you can buy on Amazon, the value of artwork is highly subjective and constantly in flux. The opinions of critics and academics, the exhibitions put on by museums, and the purchases made by celebrities all influence the cultural matrix that underpins a price. \nIf a work of art sells for too low a price or fails to move for a long time after being put up for sale, it can be read as a sign that interest is waning, and future prices for the artist\u2019s work will drop. If the work sells for too much, some may see the market as overheated and hesitate. If a collector buys a work and then promptly sells it six months later, even at an equal or higher price, that can be a negative signal of an artist whose fame is fleeting. In order to maintain control of the market, galleries and auction houses work to tightly control every aspect of a sale. So the idea of allowing an anonymized online platform to sell their works to strangers was terrifying. \nThe value of an artwork is highly subjective and constantly in flux\nArtsy co-founder and CEO Carter Cleveland grew up surrounded by high culture and numbers. The son of an art historian and a financier, when he enrolled at Princeton in 2005, he says he was shocked by the transition from a home full of fine art to the empty walls of his dorm room. So, he set out to decorate, but he was surprised to find there was almost no fine art available to browse or purchase online. \u201cI thought, \u2018How does this not exist? Maybe I could build this,\u2019\u201d he recalls, sitting in Artsy\u2019s office above Canal Street in Manhattan. \u201cI was very na\u00efve at the time. I didn\u2019t realize that it wasn\u2019t because no one had thought of this before. It\u2019s because the industry is really, really resistant to change.\u201d\nCarter\u2019s first project was building a system that could learn to recognize similarities between art and make recommendations to users based on their taste. Cleveland secured funding through startup competitions and from friends and family, and by 2008, he had built a basic system that could take a little bit of data about what kind of art a user liked and spit back a useful recommendation for another work they might enjoy. However, when he took it around to galleries and asked if they would consider adding their collections to his project, the response was icy. \n\u201cThe reaction was, \u2018What are you doing in here? Why would I ever associate my gallery and our artists with some 22-year-old and his website?\u2019\u201d Cleveland says with a laugh. \u201cReality sets in.\u201d\nArtsy wasn\u2019t the only startup trying to convince galleries that sharing their inventory with an online marketplace was a good idea. Companies like ArtSpace, Paddle8, and ArtNet were all offering to sell pieces on behalf of galleries for a small commission. Despite the promise of a bigger audience, however, galleries were still hesitant. The goal for galleries, says Andrea Hill, who served for several years as head of gallery relations at Paddle8, is to make sure that an artist\u2019s individual market is carefully protected. \u201cThat want to carefully track inventory, anticipate auction cycles, and avoid becoming bystanders should an artist\u2019s market get overheated, at which point there might be a price correction.\u201d \nJust as galleries will give first crack at a hot work to a collector whose cache will boost the artists brand, they will ban collectors who flip artworks too quickly or at the wrong price. \u201cIt\u2019s a gray market,\u201d explains Hill. \u201cA gallery would prefer that if you bought a piece from them and want to resell it a few years later, you would go to them first.\u201d A sale can be done quietly, through a private network, protecting the future price.\nBy 2010, Artsy was two years into its efforts with almost no galleries on board, and it was running low on cash. They company was saved by a check for $1.25 million from Thrive Capital, a venture firm founded by Joshua Kushner. (Thrive also participated in subsequent rounds of funding, and led Artsy\u2019s $18.5 million Series B. Kushner sits on the board.) That investment powered them through to a meeting with Larry Gagosian, an influential art world dealer who had worked with Cleveland\u2019s father. \u201cThrough family contacts we got Larry Gagosian and Pace Gallery,\u201d says Cleveland. \u201cThey were buying into the vision that somehow the art market would come online. Once we had a few top names on, all the rest followed.\u201d\nArtsy also pivoted its business model to make it more attractive to galleries. It moved away from the direct sales and commission model, instead returning power to galleries by allowing them to withhold pricing information and take control of the sales process after a customer expressed interest. Artsy would generate revenue by selling gallery subscriptions, which came with tools to showcase their artists, highlight upcoming programming, and list their art for purchase. Artsy also makes a commission on items it helps sell at online auctions. In addition, it has also begun to tap its user base to source works collectors want to sell, a service for which auction house partners will pay an additional commission. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not some flame throwing revolutionary, but rather a partner that works with industry to expand the market.\u201d\nThere are numerous works available directly for sale on Artsy, ranging in price from $500 to more than $50,000. But for the vast majority of pieces, collectors use Artsy to inquire directly, then take the process offline with the gallery. Instead of playing the role of an aggressive disruptor, Artsy has positioned itself as a tech platform that can expand galleries\u2019 reach. \u201cYou\u2019re not some flame-throwing revolutionary, but rather a partner that works with industry to expand the market,\u201d said Sebastian Cwilich, a former Christie\u2019s executive who now works as Artsy\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cMost people who can afford to buy art today don\u2019t do it. We think there is an opportunity for the market to be at least 10 times bigger.\u201d\nThe strategy paid off. When Artsy launched to the public in 2012, it had a little over 20,000 images from 275 galleries and 50 museums. Today, Artsy is far and away the biggest player in the online art market, with over 800,000 works from over 4,000 galleries. Not only have gallery owners come around to embracing Cleveland\u2019s online marketplaces, 1,800 galleries now pay Artsy between $425 and $1,000 a month to be members. The company helped to put on 41 auctions last year, and is on track to participate in over 160 auctions in 2017. And Artsy says that it facilitates over $20 million in art sales each month, with an average distance of 3000 miles between the buyer and seller.\n\nAlongside its gallery connections, the core of Artsy\u2019s product is a genome for predicting what kind of art you may like; think of it as a Pandora for art. Eight years ago, as a reporter covering the New York City startup scene, I signed up for Artsy\u2019s weekly email. I ignored most of them, but every once in a while I would click through, exploring Artsy\u2019s website, favoriting works I liked, and following artists who seemed to activate my visual pleasure centers. \nOver time, the recommendations honed in on my taste. It offered up the chunky brushstrokes of Japanese painter Aine Kinashi, the bright geometries of Cuban painter Waldo D\u00edaz-Balart, and the sardonic, stylized pop of American artist Ed Ruscha. One piece of art at time, the algorithm mysteriously honed in on my taste.\n\n\nArtsy\u2019s genome for Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh, 1889\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Period\nLate 19th Century: 100; Modern: 100.\nGeography\nThe Netherlands: 100; France: 60.\nMedium and Technique\nFigurative Painting: 80; Abstract versus Figurative Art: 50; Oil Painting: 100; Large Brushstrokes & Loose Brushwork: 90; Passage: 70; Impasto: 40; Gestural: 50.\nVisual, Physical, and Compositional Qualities\nFlatness: 30; Dynamism: 50; Dark Colors: 30; Bright and Vivid Colors: 40.\nSubject Matter and Content\nLandscapes: 100; Light as Subject: 90; Times of Day: 90; Movement: 60; Rural Life: 40.\nStyle / Movement\nPost-Impressionism: 100;\nRelated Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stopped by Artsy\u2019s office recently to get a sense of how The Art Genome Project worked. It\u2019s run by Madeleine Boucher, who graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in art history before finding her way into the startup world. \u201cThe genome is the search-and-discovery tech that powers virtually all of Artsy\u2019s products,\u201d she said. \nThe genome process starts by manually assigning traits. Many are purely factual: this is a painting; this is a watercolor painting; this is watercolor painting from Japan. Others are more subjective: giving the algorithm data about which works are concerned with religious themes, evocative of memory, or laced with humor. \nEach artist and each work is entered into the genome by a team of seven genomers, a collection of art historians and academics who spend every other Friday in a conference room at Artsy\u2019s office arguing over which traits are best for a particular work and at what value.\nEach gene is also assigned a relative weight between 0 and 100 that describes how central it is to the character of the artist or work. So, for example, Pablo Picasso gets 100 for cubism, since he pioneered the style. Mondrian, who encountered cubism and experimented with it, gets a 30. It is exhaustive work. Over the course of a decade, the team has given a genome to hundreds of thousands of pieces of art.\nArtsy\u2019s algorithms take the weight of each gene, look at how often it appears in the pool of artists and artwork, and uses that to judge how significant that characteristic is. It then triangulates relationships between artists and works based on those characteristics. Artsy doesn\u2019t use the collaborative filtering techniques common to services like Amazon and Spotify, because it wouldn\u2019t mesh with the singular nature of works of art. \u201cWith Amazon you can say, \u2018people who bought this kitchen knife also liked this plate,\u2019\u201d explains Boucher, \u201cbut that assumes that you have an almost unlimited supply of each product to recommend, whereas typically we have one.\u201d Since most of the images on Artsy represent unique objects, the algorithm has to be able to compute similarity between objects, instead of similarity between user\u2019s behavior. \nWealthy collectors treat works as investments, so the company is looking to expand its range of recommendation algorithms\nOf course, for many serious art collectors, taste is only part of the consideration. Wealthy collectors treat works as investments, and so the company is looking into ways it might expand the range of its recommendation algorithms to what art will likely accrue in value. Art advisors were, for decades, central to the process of helping collectors decide what to buy from this perspective. But here, too, Artsy is looking to replace humans with software.\nThe company recently acquired a startup called Art Advisor and made that company\u2019s CEO, Hugo Liu, into its chief scientist. Liu\u2019s co-founder was Lucas Zwirner, son of the influential gallery owner David Zwirner. At Art Advisor, Liu and his team built a system to try and predict rising stars in the art market. \u201cWe looked at publicly available data from things like gallery shows, auction results, museum placements, and private collector ownership. Then we stitched that all together with machine learning to make certain evaluations about an artist\u2019s cultural significance and potential for future value.\u201d \nLiu says he sees a lot of new collectors coming out of tech and finance who want to support young and emerging artists. But they also want to make a smart purchase. They want something to help inform their decision beyond just their taste. \u201cWe are trying to help them be patrons of the art, but data-driven patrons,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat if Artsy could suggest an artist that would resonate with you, and also make a prediction about whether or not they were worth collecting as an investment?\u201d \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of digital music led to the collapse of the retail record store, and the ever-rising tide of e-commerce has been devastating to traditional malls and department stores. But the upper echelon of the art world is still predicated on personal relationships, physical galleries, and exclusive events. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very slow process, changing the mental state from back rooms and handshakes to online and transparent,\u201d said Ashley Moellering, a veteran of Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s. With just a handful of buyers and sellers operating in the world of multimillion-dollar works, that part of the market is already very efficient. \u201cA lot of big deals still go down in the back room over a handshake, but the lower-value artwork has definitely moved online.\u201d \nThe conversation has moved there as well. \u201cMost dealers feel like even if they're not selling on Instagram, they have to maintain a presence there and be posting about the fairs and openings they are going to, just to stay relevant,\u201d says Moellering. Instagram, as the world\u2019s largest image-based social network, has become the de facto online embodiment of the art world. To Moellering, that makes perfect sense. \u201cThe hyper-curated reality presented on Instagram is really an extension of the gallery or museum model.\u201d   \n\n  \n\nA post shared by @brettgorvy on Nov 20, 2016 at 10:24pm PST\n\n\n\nThe disruption to the traditional art market is opening up avenues for artists and dealers to become more independent. In November of last year, Brett Gorvy, then an executive with Christie\u2019s, posted an image of a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting up for sale on his Instagram before boarding a plane from New York to Hong Kong. By the time he landed, three clients who saw the Instagram post had texted to inquire about buying the piece. A few days later, one of them bought it for $24 million. Gorvy has since left Christie\u2019s to start a new venture that relies as much on Instagram as physical gallery spaces and live events. \nArtists like Nathan Ritterpusch, whose work sells for more modest sums, have begun to experiment with the online market. A few of Ritterpusch\u2019s works are available on Artsy, and he\u2019s been focusing on building up his brand on Instagram, where collectors have snapped up several paintings. The trick, he explains, is to play it coy. \u201cIf you look like you\u2019re there to sell things, it doesn\u2019t work well. Just like the rest of the art world, it\u2019s about how your brand yourself.\u201d His feed is a mix of works in progress; studio visits to other artists; trips to openings and fairs; and the occasional hint at commerce, the rare offering to transact. Around Christmas, he posted a finished painting with a brief caption. \u201cFresh from the framers. Wanna hang?\u201d\nNot everyone is excited about fine art moving online. \u201cIt scares me that so many people are actually buying art off of a picture,\u201d says McCormick, the art critic. \u201cFor most people there's an endless scroll of images coming in across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Well that's not art. Even if you're looking at paintings and sculpture, that's not art. Those are pictures of art,\u201d says McCormick. He believes a lot of younger collectors, especially those buying art without seeing it in person, don\u2019t fully understand the difference. \u201cWe're losing the primary experience of standing before painting. Of going out onto the street and seeing a work in the context of the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d\nI exemplify the new breed of customer McCormick is afraid of. Over the years, I\u2019ve taken screenshots of hundreds of works that Artsy recommended to me, putting them into a folder I use for my desktop backgrounds. I\u2019m not at a point where I can afford to buy art, but someday I hope to be.\n\u201cIn terms of democratizing the market and expanding the audience, it has worked quite well,\u201d says McAndrew, the art market economist. \u201cThe online market is growing while the market as a whole is falling, so it\u2019s a bright spot.\u201d\nArtsy has gotten plenty of direct criticism for trying to bring works online. \u201cWhen I was trying to bring galleries onto the platform, I heard that sentiment a lot: that if art is more accessible, it\u2019s worth less,\u201d says Cleveland. Cleveland prefers to see today\u2019s culture, and its obsession with the sharing on social media, as an opportunity. \u201cWe do live in an age where people spend so much of their lives consuming images on their phones. For a lot of people, once you\u2019ve seen the beautiful sunset or the hot person a hundred thousand times, you\u2019re ready for something different.\u201d\n"}
