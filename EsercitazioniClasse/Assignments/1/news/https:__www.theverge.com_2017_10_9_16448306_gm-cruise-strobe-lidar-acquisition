 Cruise, the self-driving startup acquired by General Motors last year, is now gobbling up companies of its own. Today, the company announced its plan to buy Strobe, a startup that makes LIDAR sensors that help autonomous vehicles “see” their surroundings. the whole LIDAR array reduced to a single chipThe particularly attractive thing about Strobe, according to Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt, is that it has successfully reduced the LIDAR array down to a single chip, which will help reduce production costs by nearly 100 percent. This will help speed the manufacturing and deployment of self-driving cars to all communities, such as suburban and rural areas “where ride sharing is less common today,” Vogt said in a post on Medium.Cruise is currently operating a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, but only for its own employees. By purchasing Strobe, Cruise hopes to ramp up this service for more cities and people. Vogt says Strobe’s sensors provide distance and velocity data that can be checked against their other sensors, like radar for redundancy. “When used together, cameras, LIDARs, and RADARs can complement each other to create a robust and fault-tolerant sensing suite that operates in a wide range of environmental and lighting conditions,” he says.An early Strobe LIDAR prototype.Image: CruiseOf course, when Cruise sold to GM last year, it portrayed itself as a “full stack” self-driving company that could successfully design and build all the necessary components. At the time, Vogt believed that GM’s investment in Cruise would help his company get to a full-stack solution quicker than his rivals. Now it appears that it was never that simple. (Spokespersons for both Cruise and GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)LIDAR is a key ingredient in autonomous driving, which has driven big automakers and tech companies on a hunt to scoop up any startup with the skills and technical know-how needed to produce these complex laser sensors. Last year, Ford invested $150 million in Velodyne, one of the largest manufacturers of LIDAR. Until recently, Alphabet’s Waymo was also using Velodyne sensors on its vehicles before transitioning to its own, in-house LIDAR. Toyota recently said it would be working with LIDAR startup Luminar to help power its autonomous test vehicles.
