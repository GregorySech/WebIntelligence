{"title": "Google\u2019s AI subsidiary turns to blockchain technology to track UK health data", "content": " \nForays by Google subsidiary DeepMind Health into the UK\u2019s medical institutions have been characterized by two major themes. First, amazing results powered by cutting-edge AI; and second, a lack of transparency over the handling of the UK\u2019s public-funded data. With the science going swimmingly, DeepMind Health is focusing more than ever on reassuring UK citizens that their medical records are in safe hands. Its latest plan is a public ledger that shows which bits of data it\u2019s using; when; and for what purposes. \nThe initiative is called the \u201cVerifiable Data Audit,\u201d and was announced this week in a blogpost written by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and the company\u2019s head of security and transparency, Ben Laurie. The Audit technology is not yet in place, but would keep a publicly accessible record of every time DeepMind accesses hospital data, using technology related to the blockchain. \n\u201cEach time there\u2019s any interaction with data, we\u2019ll begin to add an entry to a special digital ledger,\u201d write Suleyman and Laurie. \u201cThat entry will record the fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why \u2014 for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect possible acute kidney injury.\u201d\nLike blockchain technologies, this information will be write-only \u2014 it can\u2019t be edited after the fact or deleted. It will also make use of cryptographic proofs that will allow experts to verify the integrity of the data. Unlike most blockchain systems, though, the ledger won\u2019t be distributed among members of the public, but stored by a number of entities including data processors like DeepMind Health and health care providers. The company says this won\u2019t impede the verification process, and that the choice was made to make the ledger more efficient. Blockchain entities like Bitcoin are distributed among lots of different players require a lot of power (computing and literal) to compile and check \u2014 as much as a small country, according to some estimates. \nSpeaking to The Guardian, Nicola Perrin of the Wellcome Trust said the technology should create a \u201crobust audit trail\u201d for public health data managed by DeepMind. \u201cOne of the main criticisms about DeepMind\u2019s collaboration with the Royal Free [Hospital Trust] was the difficulty of distinguishing between uses of data for care and for research,\u201d said Perrin. \u201cThis type of approach could help address that challenge, and suggests they are trying to respond to the concerns.\u201d DeepMind Health says it wants implement \u201cthe first pieces\u201d of the audit later this year. \n"}
