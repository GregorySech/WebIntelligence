{"title": "Ja Rule\u2019s music festival disaster is a good reminder not to trust Instagram sponcon", "content": " \nIf you\u2019ve been on Twitter the past couple of hours, you may have heard of something called Fyre Fest, and you may have heard that it\u2019s already a disaster, even though it technically wasn\u2019t supposed to start until today. The music festival, which was billed as a luxury experience in the Bahamas, has been \u201cfully postponed,\u201d which is fancy festival speak for \u201ccanceled.\u201d The ticket holders who made it to the fest are currently stranded on the island of Exuma, living in what some have called a \u201ctent city.\u201d Others never even left Miami. The festival\u2019s website is currently just a placeholder for an apology letter.\nFyre Fest was the brainchild of Fyre Media, a startup owned by Ja Rule and Billy MacFarland. Tickets reportedly cost between $450 and $12,000 dollars, and the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism was coordinating with the festival to provide catering, Jet Skis, and transportation via yacht. Now guests are apparently signing pieces of computer paper hoping to get refunds.\nHere, sign this blank piece of paper\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how many people bought tickets Fyre Fest. The festival organizers barely did any promotion (its official Twitter account only features eight tweets, the first of which was sent last night, once things started going wrong). Instead, Fyre Fest relied almost entirely on popular Instagrammers and models to spread the word. \nIn Vanity Fair, Kenzie Bryant writes:\nTo announce a festival without name recognition or a finalized lineup, McFarland and Ja Rule personally invited 400 influencers in various sectors. Their only job, besides attending the festival when it came time, was to post an orange square (orange like fire) to Instagram at a certain time on on a certain day in December, announcing Fyre Festival to the public.\nBryant notes that these \u201cinfluencers\u201d included professional surfers, DJs, and a bunch of models \u2014 almost all of whom seem to have deleted the Fyre Fest announcement from their Instagram pages. \nBack in December, a group of supermodels including Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, and Hailey Baldwin posted snapshots of a photoshoot for Fyre Fest shot in the Bahamas. Ratajkowski was, according to Vanity Fair, the only one who labeled the post with the hashtag #ad, although she has also since deleted the photo. \n\n  \n  Heaven  A post shared by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Dec 11, 2016 at 2:13pm PST\n\n\n\nObviously the festival\u2019s untimely end is a result of poor management, planning, and probably a bunch of other things, but it\u2019s also a good reminder that Instagram is still full of sponsored content (\u201csponcon\u201d) \u2014 and the impossibility of constant oversight means it\u2019s often not labeled as such.\nLast year the Federal Trade Commission claimed it was going to get tougher on celebrities who posted sponsored content. The FTC said that the hashtag #ad worked as a disclaimer only if it appeared at the beginning of a caption, and that #sp and #spon were not sufficient, according to Bloomberg. But many sponsored posts are still not properly labeled. Just last week the FTC said it sent warnings to 90 \u201cinfluencers and marketers\u201d about disclosing sponsored content. In the announcement, the FTC called out Bella Hadid, Rihanna, and Michael Phelps as examples of celebs who had failed to properly disclose. \n\n  \n  Coachella who? \u00a1#FyreFestival es el festival de m\u00fasica   del que todas las celebrities est\u00e1n hablando! Lo mejor de todo es su exclusiva locaci\u00f3n, Fire Cay, isla privada en Bahamas   a la que s\u00f3lo podr\u00e1s llegar en avi\u00f3n privado. Los boletos para este lujoso evento van desde mil 500 hasta 9 mil d\u00f3lares.

One Twitter user who has already nabbed the handle @FyreFraud is now threatening a lawsuit, saying they \u201cknow where the bodies are buried.\u201d At least some of those bodies might be on Instagram, if a few rogue influencers failed to delete. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
