{"title": "Jennifer Brea documented her chronic fatigue syndrome on an iPhone so doctors would believe other women", "content": " \n\u201cFrom as early as I can remember, I wanted to swallow the world whole,\u201d first-time filmmaker Jennifer Brea declares at the start of her documentary Unrest. \nAs a young woman, she attended Harvard and then Princeton to study political science. She traveled widely and fell in love. And then she became incredibly, inexplicably tired, often unable to get out of bed and unable to get herself up off the floor if she fell. She was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME), a little-understood but not at all rare disease that affects an estimated 836,000 to 2.5 million people in the United States. It has no cure. \nAs a bed-ridden Brea explains in the film, \u201cIt was like I had died but was forced to watch as the world moved on.\u201d \n\nThe condition is one that\u2019s hard to explain or externalize, and Brea was moved to make a documentary about it because of one fateful conversation with her doctor. \u201cInitially when I was filming, I wasn\u2019t really intending or thinking about making a documentary,\u201d she told The Verge in a recent phone call. \u201cBut I was just sort of stuck in bed without a lot of answers, and was just really scared and worried about what was happening to me. I had lost the ability to read or write, so I gravitated toward my phone because it was the one thing that was in my bed that was light enough to hold.\u201d\n\u201cI was seeing a doctor and I was trying to explain to him this horrible thing that had happened to me. I had tried to get out of bed, and collapsed and was on the floor, and hit my head and was just there for hours without anybody finding me. I was trying to tell him that this thing happened the previous night, and he was just not even paying attention.\u201d \n\u201cmy phone [was] the one thing that was in my bed that was light enough to hold.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until she took out her phone and showed him the footage she had shot of her face pressed against a floorboard, stray tears rolling sideways as she tries to get out words to describe what\u2019s happening, that the tone of the conversation changed. \u201cHe just turned white,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThat\u2019s really when I thought, \u2018Okay, part of the reason that this community has remained hidden is because not only are they literally hidden behind closed doors and in bedrooms, but because you really need to see the visual image in order to be able to understand what it\u2019s really like.\u2019\u201d \nAfter that conversation, Brea spent a year fundraising and figuring out \u201chow to make a film from bed,\u201d eventually bringing in $212,000 on Kickstarter. At the time, she says, it was the eighth most-successful documentary campaign in the platform\u2019s history. She shot the rest of the footage over a year and a half on a combination of her iPhone and a Canon C300, and edited for another year. The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival six months later.\nHer film is a feat of empathy, documenting not only her own struggle, but the battles of women she found on Facebook, YouTube, and through open casting calls. Casie Jackson, a woman \\ Brea met through this casting call, found that her disease alienated her from everyone but her children, the only people who really understood what she was struggling with and believed her account of her own experience.\nBrea\u2019s relationship with Jackson is central to the film, because Brea spends much of the movie worrying that she and her new husband Omar won\u2019t be able to raise a family in the midst of all that they\u2019re dealing with. \u201cI can\u2019t be someone\u2019s mom like this,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cI can\u2019t be someone\u2019s wife like this.\u201d Later she turns to her husband and tells him, \u201cI\u2019m nothing. I can\u2019t give you anything.\u201d \nJackson tells her, in the film\u2019s emotional climax, \u201cHaving kids would be the hardest thing you\u2019d ever do, and it would be the best thing you ever do. You\u2019d be a great mom.\u201d These words of reassurance don\u2019t necessarily make Brea\u2019s fears go away, and she says this is the most challenging part of putting together a documentary about chronic fatigue. \u201cUsually, you think of these arcs in storytelling where you start off in a certain state, and things have to get worse to get better, but it\u2019s this journey that makes sense in a linear way. It\u2019s very hard to tell a story that\u2019s essentially a circle. You see me well, you see me not well. I\u2019m well now, but it\u2019s not because I\u2019m well. It\u2019s because I\u2019m well temporarily.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re living with this, but remember how human we are.\u201d \nWhen she first found out she was sick, she says, she craved \u201ca story about illness\u201d that wasn\u2019t about recovery or death, but coming to terms with living with something \u201cthat might last the rest of your life and never go away.\u201d To that end, Unrest bobs and weaves between periods of Brea alone in bed, surrounded by friends at a college homecoming event, waltzing with her husband, or fighting with him about mold spores on his clothes. It\u2019s, as she says, a circular story, looping in and out of moments of doubt, and moments of bravery. \u201cOverturning stigma is not really about trying to convince you: \u2018Look how sickly I am,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about trying to convey \u2018We\u2019re living with this, but remember how human we are.\u2019\u201d \nHer biggest goal for the film is to combat the stigma around her disease, which is described in interspersed news clips as \u201cthe yuppie flu\u201d by Larry King and \u201ca made-up condition\u201d by Katie Couric. \u201cIf I may be a feminist for a moment,\u201d begins a doctor who points out that 85 percent of ME patients are female, \u201cbeing a woman is part of it.\u201d Women are also disproportionately affected by MS, which was called \u201chysterical paralysis\u201d until the invention of the CAT scan. \nIt\u2019s been proven that women have to work harder to prove they are sick before receiving appropriate treatment. This fact has been documented over and over in personal essays and massive studies, and unpacked in Leslie Jamison\u2019s landmark \u201cGrand Unified Theory of Female Pain,\u201d which argues that women\u2019s pain has been aestheticized in popular culture to the point of abstraction. So much of the pain that\u2019s even possible is unique to women\u2019s bodies, which only compounds the effect. \u201cYou want to cry, I am not a melodramatic person! But everyone thinks you are,\u201d Jamison writes. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to bleed but it looks, instead, like you\u2019re trying to get bloody.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Shella Films\n\n\nCrucial to the release of this film, Unrest is part of the Sundance Institute\u2019s new Creative Distribution Fellowship, which gives filmmakers the funds to distribute their work on their own terms, avoiding traditional all-rights deals that ask them to cede control of the film\u2019s marketing and release strategy. Brea\u2019s is one of two films selected for the fellowship in its first year, alongside Kogonada\u2019s Columbus. Chris Horton, the director of the program, told The Verge in a phone call, \u201cThis is for films where filmmakers want something more entrepreneurial, they want more creative control, or control over the rights and the revenue.\u201d Brea\u2019s film was ideal for the fellowship, he says, because \u201cshe felt an obligation to the community she\u2019d been building over the last five years in bringing this story to life. She just felt that she could build that message correctly.\u201d\nFor Brea, that means setting up virtual screenings for the homebound or disabled. The film\u2019s official premiere will be in San Francisco on September 29th, and she\u2019s selling 25 virtual seats to the screening. \u201cObviously the homebound audience can access the film on iTunes or DVD,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we also really wanted them to be a part of the theatrical window.\u201d She also made a VR experience that debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival, designed to make the representation of ME even more intimate.\nBecause she\u2019s been in constant contact with the ME community throughout the production of the film, Brea says she has a strong idea of where the major audiences for Unrest live, which helped determine which theaters the film will be shown in. Many of the people she interacted with live in the Bay Area, so Unrest will show in three theaters there.\n\u201cI know who they are, I know how to reach them, how to talk to them, why they supported the film, and why they want to see it. I couldn\u2019t contemplate, frankly, having a distributor not do well by the film,\u201d she explains, saying that it was just as important to her to have control over the final cut of the trailer, the 30-second marketing spot, and all the promotional materials as it was for the documentary itself. For a film about reducing stigma around a little-understood disease, it felt to her like the messaging was still part of the creative process. If done wrong, it could do more to reinforce the idea that this is an odd condition experienced only by a small group of people. \n\u201cI feel like what we\u2019re doing here is a different kind of creativity, but it\u2019s very much aligned with the initial intent of that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cThe moment when I was in the doctor\u2019s office with my iPhone.\u201d \nUnrest opens in limited release in the US on September 22nd and in the UK on October 10th.\n\n\n"}
