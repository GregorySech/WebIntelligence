{"title": "Moonlight star Mahershala Ali is in talks to lead a third season of HBO\u2019s True Detective", "content": " \nHouse of Cards and Moonlight star Mahershala Ali is in talks to star in a third season of HBO\u2019s beleaguered anthology show, True Detective, according to Deadline. If there were any way to get excited for the show to return, this is it. \nDon\u2019t get excited just yet: Deadline says that these are pretty early talks, and that they\u2019re far from any sort of done deal. There isn\u2019t even an order for a third season just yet, but HBO executives have indicated that they\u2019re open to another season of the crime show, and the network signed on creator Nick Pizzolatto through 2018 for some undisclosed projects. \nThe fact that Ali is in discussions to star is a positive step however. It shows that HBO is actively looking at continuing the franchise, and that there are some heavy-hitters in contention to star in it. Ali is no stranger to television, starring in Netflix\u2019s House of Cards and Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage, and he\u2019s coming off his widely acclaimed role in last year\u2019s film Moonlight.\nHopefully, with a couple of years between the second season and a potential third one, HBO and Pizzolatto will get the story right this time around. If Ali is indeed selected to lead the cast, it\u2019ll be a good hint that things are back on track. \n"}
