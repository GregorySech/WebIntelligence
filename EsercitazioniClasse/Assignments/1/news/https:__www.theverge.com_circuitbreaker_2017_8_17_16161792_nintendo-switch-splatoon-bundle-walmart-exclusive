Today, Nintendo announced a new bundle for its Switch console, which comes packed with a digital copy of multiplayer paint shooter Splatoon 2, the bright new controllers, a carrying case, and the tablet-like console itself. The bundle will cost $379.99 and will be exclusive to Walmart when it\u2019s available on September 8th.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be able to buy the controllers separately, at least for the time being. A colorful array of Splatoon 2 accessories has been available in Japan and Europe since the game launched, but for now they\u2019re only available in bundle form for fans in the US and Canada. Nintendo says that the new bundle \u201coffers fans in North America their first chance to get their hands on that Joy-Con color combination,\u201d suggesting that, at some point, the controllers will be sold on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
