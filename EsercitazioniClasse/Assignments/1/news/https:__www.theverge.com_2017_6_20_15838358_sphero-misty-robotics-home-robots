{"title": "Toy maker Sphero is starting a new company to put advanced robots in the home", "content": " \nSphero is best known as the creator of toy robots, including popular movie merch for films like Star Wars, Cars, and Spider-Man. But the company has grander ambitions than that: today it announced that it has spun off its advanced robotics division to create a new firm, Misty Robotics, with the goal of putting \u201ca personal robot in every home and office.\u201d \nMisty isn\u2019t sharing many details on what these bots will look like, and, according to a report from TechCrunch, the company\u2019s first products will be targeted at the \u201chobbyist/maker market.\u201d The image below supposedly shows \u201can early prototype,\u201d although it\u2019s not clear exactly what we\u2019re looking at. Perhaps the head of a home hub bot, like the Kuri or the Jibo? It\u2019s possible, though these bots are essentially glorified tablets-on-wheels, and their functionality has mostly been usurped by smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Misty has hinted its bots will be more sophisticated than that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA promo image from Misty Robotics apparently shows a prototype bot.\nImage: Misty Robotics\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear, though, that Misty has big ambitions, and is going to be moving slowly toward building more functional home robots. In a press release, the company says that robots in the future will be \u201cseen and treated as our friends, our teammates, and a part of our families,\u201d and will perform \u201chelpful tasks\u201d as well as \u201cinteracting with humans in entertaining and friendly ways.\u201d \nMisty Robotics has raised $11.5 million in initial funding, and employs a number of former Sphero employees, including co-founder Ian Bernstein, now Misty\u2019s head of product. Tim Enwall, who founded home automation company Revolv (before it was bought and killed off by Google) is taking on the role of CEO. \n\u201cSoon robots will be a constant touchpoint throughout our lives, becoming commonplace and serving a variety of purposes that are very different than what exists today,\u201d said Bernstein in a press release. \u201cMy vision is for Misty Robotics to lead this charge toward delivering the future we were all promised.\u201d\n"}
