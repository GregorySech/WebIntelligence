{"title": "Slimed", "content": " \nIn 2016\u2019s Ghostbusters reboot, slime was unavoidable. In the film's opening scene, a tour guide discovers that the floor of the eerie Aldridge Mansion has turned into a yawning chasm of neon green glop. Soon after, the doubtful Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) relinquishes her skepticism of paranormal activity when she nearly slips on a chartreuse wad of ectoplasm.\nIn nearly every important scene, there it is: slime dripping from ceilings or churning in fissures. At one point, Slimer steals the Ghostbusters\u2019 ride, the Ecto-1, and joyrides around Manhattan, picking up slime-babes.\nHomemade slime is colorful, feels weird, and can also make fart noises \u2014 no wonder it's popular\nSlime is, suddenly, more pervasive than it\u2019s been in decades. \u201cSlime\u201d has had an eightfold rise in Google queries since late 2015. The New York Times reports, \u201cThere\u2019s a thriving nationwide market for slime...The hashtag #slime appears on 3.5 million Instagram posts, and slime searches on Etsy have increased 9,000 percent since October, according to the company.\u201d Homemade slime projects have become the de rigueur DIY children's diversion of the day. Requiring just Borax, dye, and school glue, it's a simple science project for kids of any age. Homemade slime is colorful, feels weird, and can also make fart noises. No wonder it's popular. \nA YouTube search for \u201cslime ASMR\u201d returns more than 50 videos with over a million views, all of them uploaded within the last year. Adam Vandergrift, a 38-year-old father of three, recently put his carpentry business on hold so that he and his family can focus on what is now their largest income stream: a YouTube channel called Will It Slime? Between researching, testing recipes, shooting, editing, and social media stuff, Vandergrift estimates he spends about 30 hours a week on the channel, which boasts more than 650,000 subscribers. \nThe resurgence is a nostalgic throwback to the '80s and '90s, slime\u2019s golden era. From The Toxic Avenger and Ghostbusters franchises to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Nickelodeon, slime was a dominant visual trope 20 years ago. So, what\u2019s behind its return?\n\nDefining slime is a slippery task. After all, its fundamental traits are its amorphous shape and ambiguous implications. \nIn a 1988 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \u201cSkin of Evil,\u201d the Enterprise forges a rescue mission to a seemingly uninhabited planet. Upon arrival, the crew is terrorized by Armus, a shape-shifting puddle of unidentifiable black slime, the byproduct of a process by which an alien race had cleansed itself of evil. The malicious, tar-like substance \u2014 created by the show\u2019s prop designers by mixing black printers\u2019 ink and Metamucil \u2014 nearly kills the ship\u2019s entire crew. \n\nIn Jurassic Park, slime is the mucus spat defensively by a dilophosaurus. In the Zantar video game from Wayne's World\u2019s Noah's Arcade, it's a gelatinous cube that eats medieval warriors. In Capri Sun commercials, kids transubstantiate into especially viscous puddles of Capri Sun, in search of more Capri Sun.\nSlime is generally green \u2014 often a bright or phosphorescent green, maybe a little translucent \u2014 but not always. It occupies a state of matter somewhere between liquid and solid (known as a non-Newtonian substance), but it can vary in viscosity. It can be organic or synthetic, sticky or slick, intelligent or not. In any particular work of fiction that features slime, its origins and composition are usually unknown, at least at first. Basically, \u201cslime\u201d is any kind of mysterious goo. There\u2019s room in the vat for slimes of all kinds.\n\nThe term itself traces back to the mid-19th century, but the substance first found prominence in American pop culture in the 1950s and '60s as a manifestation of Atomic Age anxieties. Though a few films portrayed slime as something relatively benign, most films of the era used the enigmatic sludge as a symbol of something far more ominous \u2014 most notably as the titular antagonist in The Blob but also in countless B-movies like The Slime People and The Green Slime. \nAs a cultural trope, slime was a particularly salient symbolic entry point to a collective uneasiness and concern about nuclear disaster after World War II. \u201cIn terms of culture, it's a postwar phenomenon,\u201d says Mark Floegel, who has worked with Greenpeace since 1989 and is currently the organization\u2019s research director. \u201cWe use 1945 as a stepping-off point in the world of toxics, because that's when industrial chemistry went crazy.\u201d In the wake of 1979\u2019s Three Mile Island meltdown and Ronald Reagan's full-throated escalation of Cold War tension, a more robust anti-nuclear movement was coalescing in the early 1980s. Previously theoretical concerns about nuclear technology were actualizing as undeniable threats to humanity. At the movies, slime became a recurring aesthetic theme. From the mucousy milieux of Alien's xenomorphs to the synthetic, sentient puddle of Terminator 2's T-1000, there was something especially slimy running straight through the 1980s. \n\nIn The Toxic Avenger, Toxie, the film's hero, undergoes his superhuman transformation after falling face-first into a drum of bubbling green stuff, left in open drums by a careless, coke-addled waste disposal crew deployed by a vaguely evil industrial company. Writer and director Lloyd Kaufman got the idea while continuously stumbling over trash during a hike with his wife. \u201cI thought that might be an interesting theme,\u201d Kaufman told Indiewire last year. \u201cThe environment.\u201d\nIn Ghostbusters II, an underground river of pink slime wreaks havoc on New York City, fed by the negative energy of the city's habitants. The Ghostbusters cannot defeat it themselves, and the slime\u2019s reign of ghostly terror ends only when positively charged mood slime brings the Statue of Liberty to life and a chorus of New Yorkers sings \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d together. As Harold Ramis told The New York Times in 1988, \u201cSlime is our metaphor for the human condition.\u201d \n\nBy the \u201890s, slime was changing once again \u2014 from something to be feared, to a substance to be embraced. The origin story of the titular heroes in a half-shell of the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series portended the shift. Dropped into a sewer full of luminous mauve ooze, four turtles mutate into sarcastic, fun-having, pizza-loving turtle-human hybrids \u2014 the world's most fearsome fighting team!\nBut no single company transformed Slime\u2019s reputation more than a TV channel aimed at kids: Nickelodeon. \nThe producer stopped short of using actual human waste, but not by much\nAs chronicled in Slimed!, an oral history of the network, Nickelodeon stumbled onto slime almost by accident. A scene from You Can\u2019t Do That on Television, one of the network\u2019s earliest shows, featured a young actor who was supposed to pull a chain and get a bucket of what looked like sewage dumped on his head. The producer stopped short of using actual human waste, but not by much. To create the illusion, a prop guy went to the cafeteria and emptied all the food that had been left on plates into a bucket, which they would then pour onto the unsuspecting actor. But they ran out of time that day and couldn't shoot the scene until a week later. However, when they resumed filming, they used the same bucket. The food was now that much older, rotting, and covered in \u201ceight inches of green crud.\u201d\nThey dumped it on the kid anyway.\n\nThe young actor looked like he was going to be sick. The producer was furious. Pretty much everyone within olfactory range was disgusted to some extent or another. But basic cable package viewers at home were immune to the smell, and the response from people who saw the sliming was overwhelmingly positive. So, it had to happen again\u2026 and again and again and again.\nProducers began to develop their own slime from a more palatable formula of green food coloring, Cream of Wheat, baby shampoo, and vegetable oil. Other Nickelodeon shows followed suit. The recipe seems to have varied from show to show, but it was typically made from some combination of the You Can't ingredients, vanilla pudding, oatmeal, applesauce, and other pantry staples.\nRegardless of the exact composition, the green slime proved immensely popular with kids. Bronwen O'Keefe is Nickelodeon's senior vice president of Live Action and TV Movies and has been with the network for 20 years. O'Keefe says slime is a naturally kid-friendly device.\n\u201cIt feels like something kids have willed into being, rather than it being something that preexisted them,\u201d O'Keefe says. \u201cIf you asked a kid who has never seen slime anywhere for their first impression, 'menacing' and 'threatening' would probably be the last place they would go to. It's fun. It's playful. You want to put your fingers in it. You want to be sticky and messy. That's just part of being a kid.\u201d\n\u201cWeird, disgusting, all those words were awesome words for Nickelodeon.\u201d\nSlime quickly became the foundation of Nickelodeon\u2019s brand. On game shows and awards ceremonies, not to mention toys, other merchandise, and virtually all of its advertising materials, slime was what differentiated the network from its competitors.\n\u201cMy theory was always that Disney was this squishy clean, everybody looked perfect, blonde hair, blue eyes situation,\u201d says Marc Summers, host of slime-heavy shows like Double Dare and What Would You Do? and a longtime face of the network. \u201cThe reason Nick took off is we only put real kids on the show. Kids who had acne and did not speak the Queen and King's English and were just real kids. The kids identified with what was going on there.\u201d\nFigure It Out host Summer Sanders says that given the choice between watching someone get slimed and being slimed themselves, kids would choose the latter every single time. It was an honor and a privilege to be slimed, and so slime fit well with Nickelodeon's overall \u201ckids first\u201d brand. \u201cWalking through the offices,\u201d Sanders says, \u201cthe worst word you could ever hear from a kid is 'boring.' Weird, disgusting, all those words were awesome words for Nickelodeon.\u201d\nBut by the early 2000s, slime\u2019s appeal was waning. In movies and television, slime was phased out as practical effects gave way to CGI. Believable slime is easy enough for a kid to make, but it\u2019s laborious to render digitally. Its translucence makes a real chore of rendering light convincingly and requires an obscene amount of computing power. \u201cYou see refracted backgrounds and light coming through it as well as bouncing off it,\u201d Tom Bertino, Industrial Light & Magic's animation director told Creative Planet Network about the production of Flubber. \nAnd for the next decade, slime went largely dormant.\n\nThen, about a year ago, slime reentered the public consciousness, largely through Instagram and YouTube. Meanwhile, studios keep plumbing the depths of '80s and '90s nostalgia for reboot material, and slime continues to gain popularity with children. The Associated Press is calling 2017 \u201cThe Summer of Slime.\u201d In just a few months, Elmer's has gotten upwards of 200,000 mentions of \u201cslime\u201d on its social media platforms. One teenage \u201cslime-trepreneur\u201d has amassed more than 650,000 followers on Instagram and has a book on the way. DIY slime kits are framed as a means of getting kids interested in science. \n\u201cIt's a way for them to get involved,\u201d says Vandergrift of the Will It Slime? YouTube channel. \u201cIt's basic science, and it's exciting for them. We get requests from companies that want to get kids more involved with STEM activities. They're realizing that this is a great doorway to that.\u201d\n\nSlime can teach kids basic lessons about cross-linking molecules, like sodium borate, the active ingredient in Borax that ties the long, molecular chains of glue together to create the slimy consistency. The process also offers a few different variables kids can change to see the effects on the finished product. More important than the specifics of the science lesson, though, it gives kids a sense of agency \u2014 from the teenagers pulling in book deals and major advertising revenue from their slime projects to any kid making a little blob of it in their bedroom. All that\u2019s needed is a few minutes and a couple items you can find at a grocery store.\n\u201cIt's not often that a kid gets to synthesize a molecule,\u201d says Steve Spangler, a national figure for science education and a sought after public speaker. Spangler says that the recent spike in interest is likely driven by social media. It\u2019s bringing kids together and empowering them to make and share their own creations. Spangler believes the real potential here lies in channeling that energy and excitement into getting young scientists interested in STEM-based careers maybe even entrepreneurship.\nVandergrift recognizes that slime won\u2019t be popular forever, but he believes it has at least a few more years before the fervor dies down again.\n\u201cRight now, it shows not too many signs of slowing down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can look at a tech channel [on YouTube], and they're doing slime because they recognize the trend and will do anything to bring more people in. Everybody does slime now.\u201d \nCorrection: A previous version of this article misquoted Adam Vandergriftas as referring to slime\u2019s popularity on the social platform Kek. Vandergriftas was in fact referring to YouTube tech channels. The copy has also been amended to better reflect Steve Spangler\u2019s sentiment on getting youth involved in science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
