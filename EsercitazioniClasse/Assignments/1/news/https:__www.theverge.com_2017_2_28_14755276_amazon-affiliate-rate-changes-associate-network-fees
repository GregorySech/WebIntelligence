{"title": "Bloggers are panicking over changes to Amazon\u2019s affiliate system", "content": " \nThursday night, members of Amazon\u2019s associates program got some urgent and unexpected news. Rumors had been swirling for weeks, but a late-afternoon email made it official: on March 1st, the affiliate rates would be changing, shaking up one of the web\u2019s longest-running ways to make a quick buck.\n\u201cThese changes simplify the fee structure,\u201d the message read, explaining the new rate structure. \u201cWe want to reward associates that can refer sales across those categories.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really hit yet what this means.\u201d\nFor Tracy E. Robey, who runs the beauty blog Fanserviced-b, the impact was more stark: a pay cut. With the affiliate cut for a typical purchase dropping from 8 to 6 percent, she anticipates that her checks from Amazon will go down by as much as 20 percent. For Robey, her blog is still more of a sideline than a job, but as she looks to expand her growing business, she says that drop could have real consequences.\n\u201c[Amazon\u2018s affiliate program] has been a really good thing for a long time for lots of people,\u201d Robey says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really hit yet what this means.\u201d\nSmall-scale bloggers like Robey won\u2019t be the only ones hit by the rate changes. Publications like The Wirecutter have built thriving businesses entirely on affiliate payments, which are made by vendors like Amazon whenever a referred customer buys a product. Though a number of companies offer similar programs, Amazon\u2019s affiliate system is the most lucrative, and auto-tagged product links have become a significant part of many online businesses\u2019 revenue. (That includes The Verge, which auto-generates affiliate links in some cases.) Though the relationship can be lucrative, it\u2019s also entirely subject to Amazon\u2019s discretion \u2014 and as Robey and others are learning, it can often change with little to no warning.\nIt\u2019s hard to predict exactly what Amazon\u2019s new rates will mean for those participating in the program, but there\u2019s plenty of reason to be nervous. The most immediate change will be the end of Amazon\u2019s \u201cvariable standard program fee\u201d rates, which gave sites a higher cut as they drove more business to Amazon. The scale ranged from 4 to 8.5 percent, depending on how many products visitors bought in a given month. Robey says she never had trouble selling enough products to earn an 8 percent rate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some pain as a result of it.\u201d\nAs of March 1st, that standard will be replaced with a new category-by-category system. That means affiliates selling products in certain favored categories will get higher rates, including \u201cdigital video games\u201d and \u201cluxury beauty,\u201d while most products see a steep drop-off. Amazon says the changes were made to simplify the system and that most associates will come out ahead, although it\u2019s unclear how to square those predictions with the falling rates.\nAmazon has already made similar adjustments in many overseas markets. In 2015, the company moved its European affiliate program to a category-based structure, and according to the affiliate management firm GeniusLink, the result was more of a subtle chill than a freeze-out. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some pain as a result of it,\u201d says GeniusLink CEO Jesse Lakes, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t had a single client who stopped doing business because of the new payout structure.\u201d\nAmazon has long offered short-term bounties and bonuses around specific products, but the new system gives the company more power than ever to promote certain brands and categories. Affiliates hawking Amazon\u2019s own products, like Prime Video, Prime Music, and Kindle Unlimited, will receive significantly higher rates than physical versions of the same media from traditional publishers.\nRobey is particularly rankled by the distinction between \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201cluxury beauty\u201d \u2014 a difference between a 6 and 10 percent commission under the new system. Almost none of the products she covers are grouped in Amazon\u2019s luxury beauty category, although she considers many of them luxury goods. The result is a major incentive to write about brands in the favored category, although Robey says she won\u2019t change the products she writes about.\nStill, as Amazon shifts its attention to new ventures in streaming and personal assistant hardware, many see it as an ominous sign for the affiliate program. \u201cAmazon has done such a great job taking all their profit and dumping it back in to their business. And investors are now asking Amazon to show a profit,\u201d says Lakes. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they\u2019re whittling a few percent here and there.\u201d\n"}
