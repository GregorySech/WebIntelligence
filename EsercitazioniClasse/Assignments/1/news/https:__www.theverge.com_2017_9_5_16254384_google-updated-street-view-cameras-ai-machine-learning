{"title": "Google has updated its Street View cameras for the first time in eight years", "content": " \nThe days of the large, globe-like cameras on top of Google Street View cars may be slowly disappearing. Google has refreshed the design for the cameras used to capture Street View images, which is its first significant upgrade in eight years, reports Wired. The new camera rig will help capture photos that are clearer, higher in resolution, and more vivid in color. Like the old design, the rig will attach to a vehicle\u2019s roof, but the smaller ball on top now features just seven cameras (down from 15) fitted with 20 megapixel sensors. The rig also plays host to two cameras that take still HD photos, and two \u201ccans\u201d on the front and back for laser radar.\nGoogle\u2019s machine learning and AI capabilities mean that when photos are captured by a Street View car, algorithms can detect and note relevant street names and numbers, automatically adding them to Google\u2019s database. The software can also identify business names and logos. Google is working to better the software, taking its capabilities further so one day it can recognize different types of stores based on what they look like, and reading smaller signage that show details like opening hours. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the pink store next to the church on the corner?\u201d\nBetter technology should lead to better source data for Google\u2019s machine learning capabilities, which will allow it to expand Google\u2019s search and Assistant functions. In an example to Wired, Google\u2019s vice president and head of its mapping arm Jen Fitzpatrick says in the future, Google Maps might be able to answer more detailed questions that reference how the world looks, such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the pink store next to the church on the corner?\u201d Those questions can only be answered if \u201cwe have richer and deeper information,\u201d she says.\nGoogle Street View has been taking photos since 2007, and its fleet of Street View vehicles include cars, snow mobiles, trikes, and a trolley that captures photos indoors in places like museums. The camera rig has even been outfitted onto a backpack to take images of places that aren\u2019t easily reached by vehicle.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Google for additional details on the new rig\u2019s rollout. \nUpdate Sep 5th, 1:41 PM: Article updated to clarify the technology in the new rig.\n\n\n"}
