{"title": "This might be the logo for Samsung\u2019s Bixby AI assistant", "content": " \nOne of the flagship features of Samsung\u2019s upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone is a new digital assistant, rumored to be called \u201cBixby\u201d or \u201cBix.\u201d\nWhile details on the assistant are still slim, Neowin has uncovered a trademark application filed with the European Trade Mark and Design Network from Samsung for a \u201cB\u201d logo that could be the icon for the Bixby AI. The filing claims that the logo is for \u201cinteractive computer software enabling exchange of information,\u201d which would seem to fit an AI assistant. Neowin also notes that the logo could be a stylized number 8, which presumably fits in the S8 branding. \nThe Galaxy S8 is expected to be released toward the end of March \u2014 presumably when we\u2019ll find out on Bixby as well. Until then, we\u2019ll have to content ourselves with dribs and drabs of information like this to satiate our curiosity. \n"}
