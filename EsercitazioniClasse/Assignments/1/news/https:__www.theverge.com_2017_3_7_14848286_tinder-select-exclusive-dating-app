{"title": "There\u2019s a secret version of Tinder for hot people and you can\u2019t use it", "content": " \nTinder seems to be operating a secretive, invite-only tier of its hugely popular dating app. TechCrunch reports that for over six months, the company has been quietly (and very slowly) growing what it calls Tinder Select, a version of Tinder that a source described as exclusive to \u201ccelebrities and people who do really well on [regular] Tinder.\u201d  It\u2019s not a completely separate app, but rather a separate layer of the core Tinder app that the chosen ones can toggle on and off at will. \nIt\u2019s currently unknown how Tinder decides who should graduate from Tinder for the masses and gain access to Tinder Select. TechCrunch says that the existing pool of users consists of \u201cCEOs, super models, and other hyper-attractive/upwardly affluent types,\u201d which sounds like a miserable, artificial hellscape if you ask me. Very reminiscent of The League. Something tells me absolutely none of these people are among the million-plus users paying Tinder to improve their odds of a match, companionship, and reprieve from life\u2019s emptiness. (Just kidding: dating apps are probably just fine for finding lasting relationships.)\nEither way, sorry regular humans... you\u2019ve got no easy in right now. Invitees are allowed to \u201cnominate\u201d another person to join the Tinder Select ranks (yes, that\u2019s really what the process is called), but that nominee can\u2019t extend the same courtesy to anyone else \u2014 it\u2019s just one hop. Visually, Tinder Select has its own style with navy blue color accents replacing the pinkish orange interface that us common folk see. When reached for comment on Tinder Select by TechCrunch, the IAC-owned company unsurprisingly kept mum.\nAt least you can add Tinder Select to your list of hated things in this other swiping app and find a match based on that mutual distaste. \n"}
