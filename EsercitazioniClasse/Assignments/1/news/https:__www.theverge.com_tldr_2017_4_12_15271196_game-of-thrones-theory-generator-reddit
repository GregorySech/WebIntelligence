{"title": "Kill time until Winds of Winter with this Game of Thrones \u2018crazy theory\u2019 generator", "content": " \nHBO\u2019s Game of Thrones and the source material, George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire book series, are almost more fun to speculate about than they are to experience. (Almost!) The theorizing culture around both has spawned entire communities and businesses. \nThe speculation game has gone on for so long, and with such intensity, that even respected contributors on forums like the A Song of Ice and Fire subreddit are now scraping the bottom of the barrel for new \u201ctinfoil\u201d (weakly supported) ideas. Preston Jacobs, a YouTube-famous ASOIAF theorist whose video releases used to be major events, has morphed into somewhat of a running joke in the online community \u2014 he\u2019ll start off with interesting insight into the book\u2019s themes, then totally derail into stuff about the genetic science of dragons. There\u2019s just not that much left to pick apart, even in a series that\u2019s 2 million words long and has hundreds of named characters.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nReddit\u2019s most prolific Game of Thrones theorist shares his favorite predictions\n\nNow, perhaps as a response to his problem, web designer Vasanth Seshadri has created Theories are Coming. The generator pairs your choice of 10 popular Game of Thrones characters with your choice of 10 of the series\u2019s most controversial events, then explains, with very little detail or justification, how the completely absurd theory might fit together. It\u2019s not the first generator like this, though it\u2019s a lot nicer looking than previous iterations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheories are Coming is a simplistic generator with a limited range of outcomes, but it\u2019s a pretty good joke about the state of affairs while fans wait less and less patiently for the sixth book, The Winds of Winter, and thousands more pages to pull apart. It even mimics the belligerent language of new theory posts, which are often written to emphasize how utterly stupid anyone would have to be to disagree. \nIf you have some time to kill, and some ASOIAF fans to impress, you might use one of the results as a research / writing prompt and see what you can find in the books to back it up. Even if the whole internet rips it apart, it\u2019s better than retreading fAegon again, right?\n"}
