{"title": "Lenovo is working on budget Moto phones even cheaper than the G5 Plus", "content": " \nThe Moto G5 Plus is an excellent, affordable smartphone with the latest Android software. But Lenovo is making an even more aggressive push for customers on a slim budget, according to VentureBeat. The company is planning to release the Moto C and Moto C Plus, two entry-level Android 7.0 Nougat handsets with the specs to match their presumably low prices. \nEach will apparently feature a 5-inch display, with the Moto C getting a non-HD resolution of 854 x 480 and the C Plus stepping up to a 720p screen. The Moto C Plus will offer LTE connectivity, but the regular Moto C will be sold in both 4G and 3G-only configurations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moto C and C Plus will be sold in multiple color options. \nVentureBeat\n\n\nAll models of both phones will be powered by MediaTek processors, another step back from the Snapdragon 625 that\u2019s proven to be an superb performer in the Moto Z Play and Moto G5. Aside from the screen, battery size will seemingly be the other significant differentiator between the C and C Plus: the former will have a 2350mAh battery, with the C Plus bumping that all the way up to 4000mAh. VentureBeat hasn\u2019t revealed firm pricing or release date info yet, but notes that both phones will come in several color choices including black, gold, silver, and red. \n"}
