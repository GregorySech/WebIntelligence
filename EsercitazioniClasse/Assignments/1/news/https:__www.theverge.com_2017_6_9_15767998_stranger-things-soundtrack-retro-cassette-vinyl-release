{"title": "Stranger Things\u2019 soundtrack is getting a retro cassette and vinyl release", "content": " \nThe two-volume soundtrack for Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things makes for some good ambient listening, but until now, it\u2019s only been available as a digital download or on CD. If you really want to get your nostalgia kick on, you\u2019re in luck: Lakeshore Records is releasing both volumes in vinyl and cassette form later this summer.\nIf you still have your Walkman, a cassette edition of both volumes is coming on July 14th. It\u2019ll only be available at Urban Outfitters, and it\u2019ll be mocked up to look like it\u2019s a vintage VHS tape and box. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Lakeshore Records\n\n\nIf vinyl is more your jam, you\u2019re in luck as well: the company is releasing a new deluxe, collector\u2019s edition record of both volumes, which will also hit stores on July 14th. There\u2019s already been a vinyl release, but this set will come with a bunch of extras: a poster, some character cards, and multi-colored vinyl records. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Lakeshore Records\n\n\nStranger Things has appealed to audiences in no small part because it\u2019s a nostalgic throwback to the types of horror and science fiction produced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen King in the 1980s \u2014 look no further than some fan-created VHS boxes and even a cassette tape package that imagine how the show would have looked like in your local store a couple of decades ago. Seeing the soundtracks arrive in these mediums is a bit of a gimmick, but it\u2019s a fun gimmick. \nWhichever way you listen to it, it should be enough to hold you over until the next season of Stranger Things, which begins streaming on Netflix on October 31st. \n"}
