While Samsung hasn\u2019t quite outright confirmed the Note 8 will make an appearance, the invitation pretty blatantly confirms it between the \u201cDo bigger things\u201d slogan and the image of an S Pen. \n\n\nSave the date!

The upcoming device is also expected to feature a dual-camera system, comprised of two 12-megapixel sensors. The Note 8 will also serve as a long-awaited upgrade for Galaxy Note fans, given that last year\u2019s Note 7 was famously recalled due to battery issues.  \n\n"}
