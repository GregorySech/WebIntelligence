{"title": "A new law makes it illegal to fly drones over landmarks like the Statue of Liberty", "content": " \nThe FAA announced today that it has restricted drone use over several national US landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore. The FAA says the new restrictions are in place at the request of US security and law enforcement agencies.\nUnder the new restriction, drones will no longer be able to fly within 400 feet of the following sites:\n\nStatue of Liberty National Monument, New York, NY\nBoston National Historical Park (U.S.S. Constitution), Boston, MA\nIndependence National Historical Park, Philadelphia, PA\nFolsom Dam; Folsom, CA\nGlen Canyon Dam; Lake Powell, AZ\nGrand Coulee Dam; Grand Coulee, WA\nHoover Dam; Boulder City, NV\nJefferson National Expansion Memorial; St. Louis, MO\nMount Rushmore National Memorial; Keystone, SD\nShasta Dam; Shasta Lake, CA\n\nThis expands the FAA\u2019s current list of no-fly zones, which includes some army bases, major sports stadiums, national parks, and major airports. Last month, the Pentagon approved a measure that would let the US military shoot down drones in no-fly areas it considered a threat.\nExceptions to the new restriction can be made, but must be coordinated in conjunction with the FAA and the particular site in question. Those who are in violation will be subject to penalties that can include fines or criminal charges, though enforcement has historically been inconsistent and disorganized. The new restrictions will be effective on October 5th, and the FAA says it is also considering additional requests from federal agencies for future drone restrictions.\n"}
