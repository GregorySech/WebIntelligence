{"title": "Google\u2019s latest platform play is artificial intelligence, and it\u2019s already winning", "content": " \nGoogle has always used its annual I/O conference to connect to developers in its sprawling empire. It announces new tools and initiatives, sprinkles in a little hype, and then tells those watching: choose us, and together we\u2019ll go far. But while in previous years this message has been directed at coders working with Android and Chrome \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest mobile OS and web browser respectively \u2014 yesterday, CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that the next platform the company wants to dominate could be even bigger: artificial intelligence. \nGoogle\u2019s free software gives it influence in the global AI ecosystem\nFor Google, this doesn\u2019t just mean using AI to improve its own products. (Although it\u2019s certainly doing that). The company wants individuals and small companies around the world to also get on board. It wants to wield influence in the wider AI ecosystem, and to do so has put together an impressive stack of machine learning tools \u2014 from software to servers \u2014 that mean you can build an AI product from the ground up without ever leaving the Google playpen. \nThe heart of this offering is Google\u2019s machine learning software TensorFlow. For building AI tools, it\u2019s like the difference between a command line interface and a modern desktop OS; giving users an accessible framework for grappling with their algorithms. It started life as an in-house tool for the company\u2019s engineers to design and train AI algorithms, but in 2015 was made available for anyone to use as open-source software. Since then, it\u2019s been embraced by the AI community (it\u2019s the most popular software of its type on code repository Github), and is used to create custom tools for a whole range of industries, from aerospace to bioengineering. \n\u201cThere\u2019s hardly a way around TensorFlow these days,\u201d says Samim Winiger, head of machine learning design studio Samim.io. \u201cI use a lot of open source learning libraries, but there\u2019s been a major shift to TensorFlow.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Google\u2019s server stacks containing its custom TPU machine learning chips.\nPhoto: Google\n\n\nGoogle has made strategic moves to ensure the software is widely used. Earlier this year, for example, it added support for Keras, another popular deep learning framework. According to calculations by the creator of Keras, Fran\u00e7ois Chollet (himself now a Google engineer), TensorFlow was the fastest growing deep learning framework as of September 2016, with Keras in second place. Winiger describes the integration of the two as a \u201cclassic tale of Google and how they do it.\u201d He says: \u201cIt\u2019s another way that making sure that the entire community converges on their tooling.\u201d \nBut TensorFlow is also popular for one particularly important reason: it\u2019s good at what it does. \u201cWith TensorFlow you get something that scales quickly, works quickly,\u201d James Donkin, a technology manager at UK-based online supermarket Ocado, tells The Verge. He says his team uses a range of machine learning frameworks to create in-house tools for tasks like categorizing customer feedback, but that TensorFlow is often a good place to start. \u201cYou can easily get 80 percent of the benefit, and then you might decide to extend the model in an iterative process working with the same tool.\u201d\nGoogle offers TensorFlow for free, but it connects easily with the company\u2019s servers for providing data storage or computing power. (\u201cIf you use the TensorFlow library it means you can push [products] to Google\u2019s cloud more easily,\u201d says Donkin.) The search giant has even created its own AI-specific chips to power these operations, unveiling the latest iteration of this hardware at this year\u2019s I/O. And, if you want to skip the task of building your own AI algorithms all together, you can buy off-the-shelf components from Google for core tasks like speech transcription and object recognition.\nGoogle is making its name \u201csynonymous with machine learning\u201d\nThese products and services aren\u2019t necessarily money-makers in themselves, but they offer other, subtler benefits. They attract talent to Google and help make the company\u2019s in-house software the standard for machine learning. Winiger says these initiatives have helped Google \u201cgrab mindshare and make the company\u2019s name synonymous with machine learning.\u201d \nOther firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft also offer their own AI tools, but it\u2019s Google\u2019s that feel pre-eminent. Winiger thinks this is partly down to the company\u2019s capacity to shape the media narrative, but also because of the strong level of support it provides to its users. \u201cThere are technical differences between [different AI frameworks], but machine learning communities live off community support and forums, and in that regard Google is winning,\u201d he tells The Verge. \nThis influence isn\u2019t just abstract, either: it feeds back into Google\u2019s own products. Yesterday, for example, Google announced that Android now has a staggering two billion monthly active users, and to keep the software\u2019s edge, the company is honing it with machine learning. New additions to the OS span the range from tiny tweaks (like smarter text selection) to big new features (like a camera that recognizes what it\u2019s looking at).\nBut Google didn\u2019t forget to feed the community either, and to complement these announcements unveiled new tools to help developers build AI services that work better on mobile devices. These include a new version of TensorFlow named TensorFlowLite, and an API that will interface with future smartphone chips that have been optimized to work with AI software. Developers can then use these to make better machine learning products for Android devices. Google\u2019s AI empire stretches out a bit further, and Google reaps the benefits. \nUpdate May 20th 06:30AM ET: Updated to clarify the use of TensorFlow by Ocado in building in-house tools. \n"}
