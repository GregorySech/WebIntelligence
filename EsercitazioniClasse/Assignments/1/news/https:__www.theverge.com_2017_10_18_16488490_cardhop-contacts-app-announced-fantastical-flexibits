{"content": " I gave up on my contacts list a long time ago. It got too big, too messy, and too confusing. But for the first time in a while, I actually want to dive back in and straighten it up. That\u2019s thanks to Cardhop, a new Mac app from Flexibits that makes it much easier to manage your contacts and actually get things done with them.Flexibits is best known as the company behind the calendar app Fantastical \u2014 and its roots show. Just like it did with Fantastical, Flexibits\u2019 goal with Cardhop is to use natural language typing support to make it much quicker and simpler to get things done. Above \u201cbirthdays\u201d is the search box.Image: FlexibitsThe app pops down from your menubar and is largely based around a search box, although it might be better described as a sort of command line. Start typing a name, and it\u2019ll pull up that person\u2019s contact info. Type in a name it\u2019s never seen before, and Cardhop is smart enough to know that you want to add someone new to your address book. You can keep on typing information, and Cardhop will automatically fill it in to the correct categories. So for example, typing \u201cJane Doe 1/1/01 555-555-5555 jane.doe@theverge.com\u201d will create a contact named Jane Doe and list the following information as her birthday, phone number, and email address.That might sound confusing, but it\u2019s not in practice. You see the information fly into the correct categories as you type it, and it\u2019s much faster than having to click an \u201cedit\u201d button and insert the information field by field, like in a traditional contacts app.Where Cardhop gets even smarter is in what it lets you do with all that information once you\u2019ve entered it \u2014 you can just type to start calling, emailing, or chatting with someone. So if you type \u201ccall Jane,\u201d it\u2019ll start a phone call, even kicking the call over to a connected iPhone. I found its email function particularly handy. You can type \u201cemail Jane hi how are you,\u201d and hitting enter will pop open a new email in your client of choice with the subject line already filled in with \u201chi how are you\u201d or whatever it is you put there. While the app is only for macOS, all of its contact management is based on iCloud, Gmail, and other contacts lists you sync through the operating system\u2019s built-in accounts tool. That means all the changes you make in Cardhop will be transferred to your phone or email client, so you\u2019ll be able to use them elsewhere \u2014 even if the handy management features won\u2019t be present.I haven\u2019t ever regularly used a contacts app because it\u2019s always seemed like too much work for too little reward, so it\u2019s possible what I find valuable about Cardhop won\u2019t hold true for someone who\u2019s already deeply invested in one app or another. But I suspect there are lots of others out there who are sick of searching through their inbox every time they need to find someone\u2019s contact info, but haven\u2019t found an app that makes entering all that information worthwhile. I\u2019ve only been using Cardhop for a few days, but so far I think it\u2019s the first app to do the trick.For those who have been trying out Mac contacts app for a while, you might notice that Cardhop looks a lot like the long-gone Cobook. Back in 2012, we wrote that \u201cCobook is to Address Book what Fantastical is to iCal.\u201d It took a while, but fittingly, Flexibits is now doing for contacts apps what it did for calendar apps.Cardhop is available today and launches at a sale price of $14.99. It\u2019ll eventually go up to $19.99 after a \u201climited time.\u201d", "title": "Cardhop is a fast and simple new contacts app from the creator of Fantastical"}
