{"title": "The best new genre of blog is \u2018emoji review\u2019", "content": " \nTumblr meme and fandom expert Amanda Brennan noticed something weird on the site yesterday \u2014 a sudden bubbling up of posts reviewing derivations of popular emoji as they appear on various platforms and apps. There are even whole blogs dedicated to nothing else.\nTake, for example, an octopus. The emoji interpretation of what an octopus with a happy face looks like differs slightly if you\u2019re using services operated by Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HTC, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Which one is the best? No one knows, but here are one person\u2019s highly subjective opinions:\n\nhttps://nectarlne.tumblr.com/post/156218485148/octopus-emoji-review\n\n\nBrennan told The Verge via Twitter DM she\u2019d never seen emoji reviews trend on Tumblr before, but was later able to find the very first emoji reviews on the site \u2014 one blogger briefly discussed Apple\u2019s flushed face and wind chime emoji in 2012 and never posted again. \nAll of the current reviews follow the longer, more elaborate structure, originating from a review of 11 different horse emoji posted in early January. That one was spun off into a much more popular post combining the review structure with the pre-existing Bee Movie meme. From there, the format quickly amassed a small but enthusiastic following, and the most popular posts rack up tens of thousands of likes and reblogs. Including some from yours truly! \nThe idea of analyzing emoji is not new \u2014 there have been whole studies dedicated to their use, and the blog Emojinalysis, which gave horoscope-inspired readings based on the recently-used emoji submitted by readers, went viral in 2014. Apple\u2019s fall 2016 emoji updates were widely despised and frequently dissected. But this is the first comprehensive, crowd-sourced review of all emoji, all at once.\n\nhttp://emojinalysis.tumblr.com/post/91094603053/subject-64-dan-30-when-i-was-growing-up-i-had-a\n\n\nOne review of Apple\u2019s spaghetti emoji rates it a 7 out of 10, noting, \u201cA classic, nice simple sauce, would eat this no problem. Probably tastes pure and the kids would love it.\u201d Nice! However, another reviewer gave Apple\u2019s bird emoji a 0 out of 5 (the numeric scale has not yet been standardized, it seems), stating, \u201cPure evil. Excessive gradients only intensify his evil intentions. There is no sweetness in this child of darkness.\u201d Yet another points out that Apple\u2019s unicorn has a neck rash. \nGoogle\u2019s lion emoji gets a perfect 5 out of 5: \u201cA good lion friend. Very simplistic and clean. You can trust him.\u201d So does its baby chick emoji: \u201cShe looks so determined!! Where is she going? What is she thinking about? I bet she\u2019s gonna do something really important.\u201d But you can\u2019t win them all. Google\u2019s pancakes get a 4 out of 10 because the butter pat on top is too big and that made the reviewer \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nhttp://anothertiredmonster.tumblr.com/post/156610510939/snake-emoji-review\n\n\nThe ram emoji was reviewed by a \u201cram expert.\u201d That one is really good. Somehow all of the dragon emoji that exist received scores of 10 out of 10. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me, considering the LG dragon only has one leg. But as I said, the blog posts are highly subjective. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t useful. \nThey\u2019re particularly useful if you\u2019re just looking for a little chuckle at your desk this morning. Isn\u2019t that what you need? For me: yes, 10 out of 10. \n"}
