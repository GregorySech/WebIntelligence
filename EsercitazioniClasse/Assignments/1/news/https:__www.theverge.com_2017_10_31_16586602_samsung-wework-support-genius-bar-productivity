{"title": "Samsung is teaming up with WeWork for its own version of Apple\u2019s Genius Bar", "content": " \nIf you break an iPhone, your next step is simple: you schedule an appointment at a Genius Bar and hope that someone can fix it. If you\u2019ve got a Samsung phone, though, things are a little harder, but Samsung is looking to change that with a new pilot program. The company is teaming up with WeWork to provide \u201ccare centers,\u201d as reported by Fast Co Design. \nThe idea is two-fold: first, you have a central place to come and get help with your Samsung products, and second (this is where WeWork comes in) you\u2019ll have a place to get some work done while you\u2019re waiting for your phone or laptop to get repaired. As Mick McConnell, Samsung\u2019s VP of design, puts it, \u201cService is a hassle. I know I\u2019m going to have to take time out of my day to do it,\u201d so why not provide a place where people can still be productive while they wait?\nIt\u2019s a nice idea in theory, but in practice, Samsung is only offering \u201ctier 1\u201d support at the WeWork locations for now \u2014 that is, help with using your device, or assistance in mailing it to be repaired offsite \u2014 but there\u2019s no \u201ctier 2\u201d support yet for things like actual repairs. So while what Samsung is offering now at the WeWork is probably useful, but it\u2019s not the kind of emergency repair and troubleshooting that people tend to rely on the Genius Bar for.  \nStill, its an interesting first step, and one can easily imagine Samsung expanding both the number of locations and the level of support if this pilot is successful. \n"}
