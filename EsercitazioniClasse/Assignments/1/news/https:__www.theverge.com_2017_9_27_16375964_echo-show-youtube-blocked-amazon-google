Speaking to reporters at Amazon\u2019s headquarters today, longtime Amazon exec Dave Limp said he would \u201csend a team to Mountain View\u201d tonight if Google would just specify what went wrong.\n\u201cIt was a surprise to us,\u201d Limp said, following an event in which Amazon introduced a series of new devices, including new iterations of the Echo. \u201cWe don\u2019t love it, on behalf of customers. We think a lot of customers were using YouTube on the Echo Show and liked it. What I\u2019ve said to Google is: just tell us where we weren\u2019t compliant with the API and we\u2019ll send a team down to Mountain View tomorrow. I\u2019ll send one tonight! And we\u2019ll get the product back in line. They just haven\u2019t told us what\u2019s wrong with it. We\u2019re committed to fixing it.\u201d\nGoogle blocked access to YouTube on the Show at 3PM yesterday. If you ask the smart speaker to show a YouTube video, Alexa says: \u201cCurrently, Google is not supporting YouTube on Echo Show.\u201d Yesterday, Google implied that Amazon had violated some aspect of the YouTube API. \u201cAmazon\u2019s implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nWhen reached for comment, Google referred us to its statement yesterday.\nLauren Goode contributed to this report.\n"}
