{"title": "Roku files for a $100 million IPO", "content": " \nRoku Inc., the company that makes various streaming devices and smart TVs, is going public, according to papers filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission yesterday. It is looking to raise $100 million, and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticket symbol \u201cROKU\u201d. \nIn the SEC filing, the company reports that it had 15.1 million active accounts as of June 30th, 2017, and that those users have \u201cstreamed more than 6.7 billion hours on the Roku platform,\u201d during the first half of 2017. Critically, Roku points out that 2.9 billion of those hours was programming supported by advertisers. \nThere\u2019s a caveat, however: the company says that it has operated at losses in the past, and that it expects \u201cto incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\u201d It\u2019s language that\u2019s similar to what other companies have made while filing for their own IPOs, such as Snap, which is also looking to the growth of advertising revenue as a road to profitability. Roku reports that as of June, it had an \u201caccumulated deficit of $244 million,\u201d and that its solution here is to attract new users to grow its advertising revenue. \nGrowing advertising revenue is of critical importance to Roku\nThat advertising money is growing in importance for Roku. The company says that in the first six months of 2017, revenue from selling players made up most of the company\u2019s finances: 59 percent, down two percent from the last half of 2016. At the same time, advertising revenue grew by 91 percent to represent 41 percent of the company\u2019s bottom line. By contrast, player revenue made up 74 percent of Roku\u2019s finances in the same period last year, while ads made up the remaining 26 percent. Roku says that its goal moving forward is to grow its user base, which will translate into new advertiser gains. \nThe company is in a good place to attract those users, working not as a straight-up streaming service, but as a platform that CEO Anthony Wood says \u201cconnects the entire TV ecosystem.\u201d The company is leading other industry giants such as Amazon, Google and Apple when it comes to active users in the connected television market, and in recent months, Roku has unveiled a range of cheaper products, such as a $30 streaming box, a television that runs just $250, to some more expensive, but still very good television offerings. Those cheaper prices might be enough to entice enough users to buy into its services, and help the company grow its desired advertising revenue. \n"}
