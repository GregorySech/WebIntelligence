{"title": "Comcast reportedly planning streaming TV service just for its internet customers", "content": " \nComcast launched a TV streaming service in a few cities back in 2015, and this year, it\u2019s apparently planning a major expansion. According to Reuters, Comcast plans to relaunch its streaming service, currently called Stream, under a new name and make it available everywhere Comcast is offered across the US.\nThe new service will reportedly be called Xfinity Instant TV, and it sounds fairly similar to what Stream already provides. The report says it could start at $15 per month for major channels, like ABC, NBC, and ESPN, but it could go up to $40 per month by adding on additional channels.\nThis could be a net neutrality nightmare\nStream is currently only available in certain cities within five states \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Hampshire \u2014 so a nationwide launch would be a major expansion. Reuters reports that it could happen in the third quarter of the year.\nXfinity Instant TV would be a competitor to streaming services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now, but there\u2019s a really critical detail here: Comcast\u2019s service would only be available to households already paying for Comcast internet service, according to Reuters. And if it\u2019s anything like Stream \u2014 which, by all means, it appears to be \u2014 it likely won\u2019t count against Comcast subscribers\u2019 internet data caps.\nThat\u2019d be a huge perk for Comcast customers and would give Comcast a big advantage over its competitors, since their services would count toward data caps. It\u2019d also be a huge violation of net neutrality \u2014 in concept, though not in law \u2014 since it favors one streaming service (its own) over everything else.\nComcast has continued to argue that the above reading of the situation is completely wrong, that its streaming TV service doesn\u2019t violate net neutrality, and that its streaming TV service is not, in fact, even an internet service. But the service is functionally equivalent to a streaming TV service \u2014 in that it passes through a broadband modem and is delivered to phones, tablets, and PCs \u2014 and the need for a Comcast internet subscription seems to underscore that.\nComcast did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFor now, the above remains a bit of conjecture, since Xfinity Instant TV hasn\u2019t actually been announced yet. But given that the FCC has looked the other way on Stream, it\u2019s not hard to imagine things panning out this way. And if Comcast expands that policy nationwide, we\u2019ll really start to see what the internet\u2019s like without net neutrality.\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.\nCorrection March 28th, 11:40AM ET: ESPN tells The Verge that it\u2019s part of the standard Stream package and not offered as an add on, as this story initially stated.\n"}
