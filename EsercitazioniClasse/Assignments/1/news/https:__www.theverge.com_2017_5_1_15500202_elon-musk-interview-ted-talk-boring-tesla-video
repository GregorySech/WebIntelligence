{"title": "10 things we learned about tunnels and Tesla from Elon Musk's TED interview", "content": " \nElon Musk is the head of a spaceflight company, an electric car manufacturer / solar energy effort, and a brain-computer interface project. Recently, though, he added a tunnel boring company to that already crowded plate. This past weekend he spoke about The Boring Company, as he\u2019s calling it, for the first time in public with Chris Anderson, the curator for TED Talks. \nIt wasn\u2019t a hard-hitting interview \u2014 while Anderson got Musk to share some details about the tunneling project, he also teed up many of the billionaire CEO\u2019s favorite talking points, and his followups were often \u201cwhoa\u201d or \u201cwow.\u201d You can watch the full video above, but here are our 10 biggest takeaways from the conversation.\nMusk wants the tunnels to span the country on a deep level\nMusk said that there\u2019s \u201cno real limit\u201d to the depth of his proposed tunnels. \u201cThe deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of open congestion with a 3D tunnel network.\u201d This, Musk said, is how to get around the most popular rebuttal so far: that underground tunnels will simply spread the congestion to a new place without completely solving the problem of traffic. Musk thinks it will be possible to create \u201cany arbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels\u201d in order to reduce congestion on the surface.\nThere needs to be a massive cost reduction before a tunnel network gets built\nAnderson mentioned that this project sounds expensive, and Musk agreed. \u201cWe need to have at least a 10-fold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling,\u201d Musk said. He thinks there are two things that will allow The Boring Company to achieve that kind of cost reduction. \nOne is to cut the typical diameter of a tunnel \u201cby a factor of two or more\u201d to 12 feet. \u201cA single-lane tunnel would have to be 26 or 28 feet in diameter to allow for emergency vehicles and ventilation for combustion engine cars,\u201d Musk said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA CGI rendering of the The Boring Company\u2019s concept, where cars would avoid traffic by being pulled underground on \u201celectric skates.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBut if you shrink that diameter to what we\u2019re attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate [this is what Musk is calling the contraptions that will grab the cars from the surface and move them through the tunnels] through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area by a factor of four. And the tunneling cost scales with the cross sectional area, so that\u2019s roughly a half order of magnitude right there.\u201d \nNext, Musk said that he wants to make his boring machines carve out tunnels and reinforce the walls being created at the same time. (Those are currently separate steps.) Musk thinks this could double the efficiency of the process which, combined with smaller tunnels, gets him to a place where he can reduce the cost by a factor of eight. \nMusk then amended his short list by adding one more goal. Current tunneling machines don\u2019t operate near their thermal or power limits, and he believes he can beat that. \u201cIf you can jack up the power to the machine substantially, I think you can get at least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that,\u201d he said.\nThe goal for The Boring Company is to beat Gary the Snail from SpongeBob SquarePants\nMusk said current tunnel technology literally doesn\u2019t even operate at a snail\u2019s pace. So he\u2019s put a target on the back of the most well-known snail in pop culture: Gary the Snail from SpongeBob SquarePants. \u201cCurrently he\u2019s capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel boring machine,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe want to beat Gary. He\u2019s not a patient little fellow. That will be victory. Victory is beating the snail.\u201d \n\u201cVictory is beating the snail.\u201d\nHyperloop technology could be used in underground tunnels\nSince Musk is now associated with two different kinds of tunnel technologies \u2014 one being the underground transportation system, the other being the above-ground hyperloop \u2014 Anderson asked him to reconcile the two. Musk said that some hyperloop tech could be used underground since the tunnels are already designed to withstand five or six atmospheres \u2014 far more than what\u2019s needed to create the vacuum required for hyperloops to work. Musk believes underground hyperloops would be ideal for certain routes, like Washington, DC to New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s no real length limit,\u201d he said. \nMusk isn\u2019t leaving Tesla anytime soon\nThe Boring Company is only taking up \u201cmaybe 2 to 3 percent\u201d of Musk\u2019s time. \u201cThis is basically interns and people doing it part time,\u201d he said. Anderson then asked if Tesla has done enough for the electric vehicle market to make Musk comfortable with moving on. Musk said he sees himself staying with the company \u201cas far into the future as I can imagine,\u201d because \u201cthere are a lot of exciting things that we have coming\u201d including the Model 3 and the Tesla semi truck.\nHe still has aggressive timelines for Tesla\u2019s self-driving tech\nMusk is known for playing fast and loose with the timelines for his grandest ideas. In the interview, he said Tesla is \u201cstill on track for being able to go cross country from LA to NY by the end of the year, fully autonomous\u201d with one of its cars, \u201cfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point during that journey.\u201d \nFrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York without touching any controls\nHe also thinks Tesla\u2019s tech is about two years away from allowing a driver to sleep through entire rides. \u201cThe real trick of it is not \u2018how do you make it work 99.9 percent of the time,\u2019 because if a car crashes say one in a thousand times then you\u2019re probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep,\u201d Musk said. Instead, he thinks the chance of a crash would have to shrink to one in 100 or 1,000 lifetimes in order for people to be comfortable enough with autonomous technology that they\u2019d be willing to nap in a self-driving car.\n\n\nMusk says shared autonomous cars are \u201c100 percent what will occur\u201d \nA future full of self-driving cars might change how we think about ownership. Musk doesn\u2019t think owning a car will be completely out of the picture, but he believes sharing will play a big role. \n\u201cAbsolutely this is what will happen: so there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car, and you can an choose to use that car exclusively, you could choose have it be used only by friends and family, only by other drivers who are rated five stars, you can choose to share it some times but not other times. That\u2019s 100 percent what will occur, it\u2019s just a question of when.\u201d \nMusk has driven a prototype of the Tesla semi, and it\u2019s apparently really fun\nThe Tesla big rig will be unveiled later this year, so it\u2019s no surprise to hear that the company\u2019s got a working version that, apparently, Elon\u2019s already driven. \u201cWhen I was driving the test prototype for the first truck, it\u2019s really weird, because you\u2019re driving around, and you\u2019re so nimble, and you\u2019re in this giant truck,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI drove it around the parking lot. I was like \u2018This is crazy.\u2019 Driving this giant truck and sort of making these mad maneuvers.\u201d\nCiting the impressive torque associated with electric motors, Musk said the forthcoming Tesla semi truck can \u201cout-torque\u201d any diesel truck. \u201cIf you had a tug of war competition, the Tesla semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.\u201d \nTesla will announce its new Gigafactories this year\nMusk thinks that about 100 of his battery-producing Gigafactories might be enough to help shift the world toward completely sustainable energy, and in working toward that goal, he firmed up plans to announce \u201csomewhere between 2 and 4 Gigafactories later this year. Probably 4.\u201d He didn\u2019t say where they\u2019ll be, only that \u201cwe need to address a global market.\u201d \nMusk played down his connections to Trump\nAnderson didn\u2019t push Musk hard on his association with Donald Trump, but he did (kind of) ask Musk to address the criticisms of that relationship. Here\u2019s Musk\u2019s full answer: \nFirst of all I\u2019m just on two advisory councils where the format consists of going around the room and asking people\u2019s opinion on things. So there\u2019s like a meeting every month or two. You know, that\u2019s the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change or you know other certain social issues \u2014 you know, I mean, I\u2019ve used the meetings I\u2019ve had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change. And if I hadn\u2019t done that, there wouldn\u2019t \u2014 that wasn\u2019t on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
