Organic compounds are the building blocks of life on Earth, and the discovery could mean \"that primitive life could have developed on Ceres,\" Michael K\u00fcppers, a planetary scientist with the European Space Agency, writes in a commentary piece published today in Science.\n\u201cprimitive life could have developed on Ceres.\u201d\nThe organic compounds were detected by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on the Dawn spacecraft, which was launched by NASA in 2007 and has been orbiting Ceres since 2015. Previous studies had found salt and ammonia to be present on the dwarf planet. And Dawn and other telescopes had detected water ice and carbonates. All these compounds could theoretically lead to life.\n\u201cCeres has evidence of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and now organic materials,\u201d Simone Marchi, a senior research scientist at Southwest Research Institute, and one of the authors of the paper published in Science, said in a statement. \u201cWith this new finding Dawn has shown that Ceres contains key ingredients for life.\u201d\nCeres is a top contender for finding alien life\nThe organic compounds were found in high concentration near the 32-mile-wide crater Ernutet, in the dwarf planet\u2019s northern hemisphere. Scientists don\u2019t know the exact molecular compounds that were detected, but they seem to be in the same groups that make up tar-like minerals here on Earth. \nThe researchers also think that the compounds were generated on Ceres, instead of being brought there by an asteroid or comet. The compounds wouldn\u2019t have survived such a powerful, high-heat impact, the study says, but it\u2019s not fully understood how exactly they moved from inside the planet to the surface.\nCeres is believed to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and understanding its mineral composition \u2014 and whether the planet harbors life \u2014 can help scientists better understand how life developed on our planet. This latest study shows that Ceres is a top contender, beyond Mars, for finding alien life in our Solar System.\n\nWhat makes a planet a planet?\n\n\n\n\n"}
