{"title": "Toddler\u2019s death said to be first in US caused by hoverboard fire", "content": " \nA three-year-old girl in Pennsylvania died Saturday morning after being caught in a fire started by an exploding hoverboard. CNN reports that a US Consumer Product Safety Commission official says it\u2019s the first death in the nation linked to a fire from one of the notoriously unsafe devices.\nThe fire, which started Friday night in a home in Harrisburg, sent several others to the hospital. The girl\u2019s father and a teenage boy were both released, while two other young girls remain in critical condition, according to the report.\nAn official with the local fire department said the hoverboard had been plugged into a first floor outlet. \u201c[The family] heard some sizzling and cracking in the hoverboard and shortly thereafter it exploded in flames,\u201d said fire chief Brian Enterline, during a press conference early Saturday morning.\nNewer hoverboards are supposed to go through battery tests\nThe official didn\u2019t state which company manufactured the hoverboard, but many models of the device have been recalled due to fire concerns. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled more than 500,000 units last July, including some from popular brands like Swagway and Razor. At the time, 99 incidents of damage or injury from the devices had been reported.\nThe recall is still active, and the commission continues to encourage hoverboard owners to \u201cimmediately stop using these recalled products\u201d and contact the manufacturer for a replacement or refund.\nNewer models of hoverboards are supposed to be UL certified and have gone through battery testing to ensure that they won\u2019t suddenly catch fire. \u201cWe would ask that if you're using these things that are knockoff brands and not UL listed, you please not use them,\u201d Enterline said. \u201cWe've seen too many fires and too many fire fatalities as a result of these hoverboards.\u201d\n"}
