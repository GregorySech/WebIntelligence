{"title": "Overwatch fandom ruled Tumblr over the last year", "content": " \nOverwatch has been a massively popular game since it launched a year ago. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s a superbly designed, tightly polished team-based shooter, but also for the incredibly diverse cast of characters that have spawned a huge culture of art, comics, fan-fiction, cosplay, ship wars, and more. Today, Tumblr\u2019s Fandometrics blog quantified just how big the community is that has sprung up around Overwatch. And, unsurprisingly, it\u2019s really big. \nHow big? According to Amanda Brennan, who runs Fandometrics, in the last 358 days, the #overwatch hashtag on Tumblr has seen \u201cnearly 150 million engagements,\u201d making it the second most used tag on the site. Overwatch on Tumblr, by numbers alone, is more popular than any TV series, movie, actor, character, or even far more generic tags, like #gif or #art.\nOverwatch has more or less held the most popular video game rank on the site by Fandometrics\u2019 measure for the last year, with the exception of a few weeks in summer 2016 when it was briefly toppled by Pok\u00e9mon Go. \nA masterclass in franchise development\nBut the huge numbers of people engaging with Overwatch content speaks to the incredible work in franchise development from Blizzard. Overwatch doesn\u2019t even have a traditional story mode or campaign to tell its characters\u2019 stories. But based on the franchise\u2019s supplemental material (comics, video shorts, and in-game clues), fans have embraced the heroes of Overwatch. \nPart of that is due to the balance Blizzard has struck here, giving players a cast of fully fleshed-out characters to play with, but leaving things vague enough that there\u2019s room for fans to tell their own stories.\nAt any rate, with the steady drip of new content that Blizzard has been doling out for Overwatch, it\u2019s likely that the community will still continue going strong for years to come. \n"}
