{"title": "FCC takes steps to block more spammy robocalls", "content": " \nThe Federal Communications Commission took steps to cut down on spammy robocalls today, passing a rule proposal that could eventually let phone companies block more unwanted calls.\nThe proposal would let phone companies block robocallers from using numbers they aren\u2019t supposed to be using. If a robocaller decides to spoof another phone number \u2014 making it appear that they\u2019re calling from a different line to hide their identity \u2014 phone providers would be able to block them if they use a number that clearly can\u2019t exist because it hasn\u2019t been assigned or that an existing subscriber has asked not to have spoofed.\nThe proposal was passed in a 3-0 vote. \u201cRobocalls are the number one consumer complaint to the FCC from members of the American public,\u201d FCC chairman Ajit Pai said. \u201cWe aim to take an important first step in ending the scourge of illegal robocalls.\u201d\nThe measure will now head into a public comment period, where phone companies and consumers can comment on the changes. In particular, the FCC is asking what it can do to better combat spoofed calls that begin in other countries and what it can do to minimize legitimate, legal calls from getting blocked by accident. There\u2019ll then be a final vote, likely later this year, on an amended version of the rules.\n"}
