{"title": "The Oculus Rift is getting a customizable VR home room and desktop window support", "content": " Oculus is announcing a revamped Rift interface it refers to as Rift Core 2.0, which supports 2D desktop windows and a customizable VR home space. The former system is called Dash, which is based around Facebook\u2019s React VR development framework. Dash is a central hub that incorporates all the old Oculus interface elements into something  you can access from anywhere in VR, designed for motion controllers. It also supports pulling 2D windows into virtual reality, where you can pin them into the VR experience.The old Oculus Home interface isn\u2019t going away, but it\u2019s changing. Home launched as a skeuomorphic virtual room that players couldn\u2019t customize, but now, it\u2019s a virtual space that you can stock with VR furniture and props. Instead of a pop-up interface, you\u2019ll access games by physically popping cartridges into a retro console. And Home is now a social space, so you can invite friends with headsets over, or go visit their own Homes. Oculus\u2019 avatars are getting redesigned in the future, too \u2014 they\u2019ll be a bit more realistic looking, and closer to Facebook\u2019s VR cartoon avatars.Rift Core 2.0 will be available in December as a free beta update for all users."}
