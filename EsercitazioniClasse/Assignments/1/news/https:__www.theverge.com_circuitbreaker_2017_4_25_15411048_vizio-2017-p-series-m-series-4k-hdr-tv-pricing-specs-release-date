{"title": "Vizio\u2019s new TVs go back to built-in apps and a normal remote control", "content": " \nA little over one year ago, Vizio tried to reinvent the TV user experience by taking menus off the screen, getting rid of built-in apps, and letting Google\u2019s Chromecast (and your smartphone) control pretty much everything. They even included an Android tablet in the box. \nIt was a very short-lived experiment. A tablet, it turns out, isn\u2019t a good remote after all.\nToday Vizio is introducing its 2017 P-Series and M-Series 4K HDR displays. Their outward designs are basically identical to last year: the P-Series is still silver, and the M-Series is still black. The company says they deliver a better picture than ever before. But the way that you use them will feel a lot more familiar to just about everyone. There are actual menus now. You can stream TV shows and movies from apps without having to pull out your phone. And the tablet is completely gone; Vizio\u2019s going back to a regular, button-filled remote control.\nThere\u2019s no other way to put it: these are just regular smart TVs again. No longer are they dumb, beautiful displays. Chromecast is still there, but its role has been dramatically reduced. Now it\u2019s just a feature \u2014 not the foundation. Rebounding from a failed merger, Vizio is putting ease of use first. There\u2019s still no channel tuner built in, which is why the company again technically refers to these as \u201cdisplays\u201d rather than televisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the P-Series and M-Series (pictured here) revert back to a more traditional menu system.\nImage: Vizio\n\n\nThe new P-Series comes in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch sizes priced at $1,300, $2,000, and $3,500 respectively. Like last year, the M-Series holds its place as the company\u2019s second-best TV line. It\u2019ll be available in 50-, 55-, 65-, 70-, and 75-inch versions ranging from $800 to $3,000. \nVizio has added a ton of branding to the product names to emphasize their upgraded picture. No longer are they just SmartCast Home Theater Displays. Now, the higher-end model is known as the P-Series Ultra HD HDR XLED Pro. Step down and you get the M-Series Ultra HD HDR XLED Plus.    \nBoth TVs continue to feature full-array local dimming, which is a critical piece in what makes Vizio\u2019s sets look so good at their price point. Both also continue to offer the same low input lag that\u2019s ideal for gaming. The P-Series has enhanced brightness versus last year\u2019s model, which Vizio claims \u201cdramatically expands the contrast range to reveal new detail with enhanced shadows and highlights.\u201d It can produce over a billion colors thanks to what Vizio calls Ultra Color Spectrum and maintains support for both Dolby Vision and HDR 10. The \u201cXtreme Black Engine Pro\u201d \u201a wow, that\u2019s some branding \u2014 gives the set \u201cinky blacks\u201d through more precise control of the backlight and the TV\u2019s local dimming zones, which number \u201cup to\u201d 128. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo tablet this time. You get a plain old remote control.\n\n\n\nThe M-Series checks off similar features; it too has Ultra Color Spectrum, supports the Dolby Vision / HDR10 combo, and Vizio is promising wider contrast and deeper blacks thanks to \u201cXtreme Black Engine Plus\u201d (not Pro, though). The key differences between the P-Series and M-Series are dimming zones \u2014 the M-Series tops out at 32, fewer than the 64 in some of last year\u2019s M models \u2014 and effective refresh rate, which is 120Hz compared to the P\u2019s 240Hz. So if you\u2019re a nut for smooth action, the P-Series might be more appealing.\nBut this is where I stop talking about picture specs. Last year\u2019s TVs looked superb, and my inkling is to believe Vizio when the company says these will look slightly better. The most important thing that\u2019s changed here is the way that you control them. Goodbye tablet; hello dumb remote. \nBoth the P- and M-Series revert back to a more traditional menu system. You can adjust your TV\u2019s settings on the actual TV screen again. And like most of Vizio\u2019s sets from before the bold switch to Chromecast, they\u2019ve once again got apps built in. \u201cVizio listened to consumers who expressed wanting options, multiple ways to search and browse content,\u201d a spokesperson said via email. The new approach brings \u201capps to the forefront of the big screen\u201d \u2014 like every other smart TV \u2014 while \u201cstill giving consumers access to thousands of Chromecast-enabled apps.\u201d This isn\u2019t Android TV, though; rather, it\u2019s proprietary Vizio software with Chromecast integration. And it\u2019s coming as a free update to existing 2016 4K SmartCast TVs this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVizio\n\n\nYou can still use Vizio\u2019s mobile app to control the TV\u2019s settings if you want, but I\u2019m certain that most people will reach for the remote. That\u2019s what influenced this shift in the first place.  And although its importance has been diminished, Chromecast might still prove crucial if you\u2019re a Netflix customer. As of now, it seems that not every popular video app will come included on these TVs. So far, Vizio has announced that Hulu, Vudu, Crackle, iHeartRadio, and Xumo will come bundled. That\u2019s it. The company makes no mention of Netflix, Amazon Video, or other apps like HBO Now/Go. \nHowever, a spokesperson clarified that this list might change before both TV lines reach store shelves this summer. \u201cWhen we are closer to launch, we\u2019ll circle back with an update.\u201d But Vizio\u2019s marketing materials also suggest that you\u2019ll need to Chromecast Netflix from your phone to the TV if you want to stream 13 Reasons Why, Louis CK 2017, or the next season of Stranger Things. Thankfully both models also support Google Assistant, so voice will be another way of quickly getting Netflix up on the screen even if it\u2019s not preinstalled. \nI\u2019m a little surprised by this quick return to the familiar, but it makes business sense. The make-Chromecast-do-everything idea was fun for tech enthusiasts, but tough for a large swath of consumers to grasp and get accustomed to. It could also be buggy at times. Vizio\u2019s \u201cwe listened\u201d stance seems to confirm all of this. But why not just run with Android TV as your software, then? The lack of everyday apps like Netflix and Amazon is a head-scratcher, too; hopefully Vizio adds them before both the new P-Series and M-Series launch in a couple months. They were there on the company\u2019s previous smart TV models, so I\u2019m confused as to what the hold-up is. \nBut I do know this: in 2017, Vizio is no longer reinventing anything. They\u2019re happy to make affordable, great looking smart TVs again. Just like before. \nHopefully the software doesn\u2019t suck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVizio\n\n\n"}
