{"title": "Qualcomm is making it easier for companies to build smart speakers", "content": " \nSmart speakers are the hottest new category in gadgets, and if Qualcomm has its way, there\u2019s going to be a ton more of them starting next year.\nQualcomm is about to make it really easy for hardware companies to start building their own speakers. It\u2019s introducing a reference design \u2014 basically, a preset configuration of chips, microphone tech, and audio systems \u2014 that companies can buy to base their products off of.\nThis isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll see a company like Amazon use. But smaller companies that want to create their own take on an Echo will be able to pick it up to quickly turn around a new product. It saves a bunch of time on testing, since Qualcomm guarantees everything will work together, which lets products get to market faster.\nIncludes support for hi-res audio over Bluetooth\nQualcomm\u2019s Smart Audio Platform includes most of the core tech needed in a smart speaker (aside from the actual speaker). It has far-field microphone systems, with support for beamforming, echo cancellation, and wake words. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (including aptX HD for hi-res audio streaming), as well as support for Qualcomm\u2019s AllPlay speaker speaker syncing system. And it\u2019s generally designed to support the integration of voice assistants, like Alexa.\nAllPlay isn\u2019t a widely used system, which somewhat tempers the excitement here. Qualcomm advertises its new platform as being able to support synchronized playback between speakers, setting up zones, and even handling multi-channel surround sound, but that all relies on someone owning a bunch of AllPlay speakers. That might be more likely if a bunch of speakers roll out in the coming years with Qualcomm inside. But until then, these are mostly just going to be standard Bluetooth speakers.\nQualcomm says the first products based on its system should arrive by the end of the year, but it expects the pace to pick up in 2018.\n"}
