{"title": "Netflix\u2019s new Defenders series is nowhere near as weird as the original comics", "content": " \nThe latest trailer for Netflix\u2019s Defenders series is a startling change of tone for the MCU. The new superteam strips to skimpy speedos and battles giant gnomes in the name of feminism. Extradimensional robots play chess for the future of the Earth. Friendly Neanderthal apes transform into evil aliens. Also, perhaps worst of all, the heroes are attacked by perfidious porpoises.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nExcept none of that is true. Obviously, Netflix did not actually create a trailer featuring gnomes or porpoises, perfidious or otherwise. The Defenders show features a street-level team, tackling crime on a relatively mundane level, at least compared to their god-fighting cinematic counterparts in the Avengers. A new generation of television superhero fans are going to associate \u201cDefenders\u201d with low-key, gritty superheroics and a superteam that spends its downtime chatting and hanging out in neighborhood restaurants. \nFor those who know the original comic book version of the Defenders, that\u2019s ironic. The Defenders started out as one of the more ludicrously cosmic super-groups ever to battle oversized crustaceans in the pages of a Marvel comic.\nWriter Roy Thomas more or less created the Defenders by accident in 1970. Thomas had been writing Dr. Strange, which got canceled mid-story. So he decided to tie up loose ends by finishing the arc in the other comics he was writing \u2014 namely, Sub-Mariner and The Incredible Hulk. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nAs it happens, Sub-Mariner, the Hulk, and Dr. Strange are all unsuited for super team-ups. The Hulk is a semi-sentient green glob of muscle who attacks everyone on sight. The Sub-Mariner is the arrogant ruler of Atlantis, and he hates surface-dwellers. He also tends to attack everyone on sight. Dr. Strange is a master of the mystic arts whose adventures involve a whole separate interdimensional mythology that doesn\u2019t have much to do with the rest of the Marvel Universe. To top things off, Roy Thomas (and his early replacement on The Defenders, Steve Englehart) often added the Silver Surfer \u2014 a cosmic-powered alien who, like Namor, mostly despised humanity. \nThe early Defenders had little in common, except that they all hated each other and wore almost no clothes. Since they didn\u2019t think of themselves as a team, just getting them together for each adventure involved improbable logistical improvisation. One issue began with Namor literally hurtling from the sky to fall in front of a startled Hulk. (\u201cIt is Namor \u2014 the Fish-Man \u2014 the one who used to be Hulk\u2019s friend!\u201d)\nWhen the writers do manage to get everyone in one place, the heroes spend as much time fighting each other as the bad guys. The first issues involve a lot of dueling beefcakes, with one character or the other bellowing, \u201cI am your friend!\u201d as they roll semi-nude across the panels.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nEven when the Defenders take a moment to stop punching each other, dialogue often centers around competitive boasting. Hulk declares, \u201cI am the strongest one there is!\u201d while Namor intones, \u201cThese walls were made for lesser fish\u2026 not for Namor!\u201d\nIn an effort to moderate the chest-thumping, Englehart introduced a female team member \u2014 and that\u2019s when things got really weird. Valkyrie has one of the oddest, most disturbing origin stories in superherodom. Originally, she was a woman named Barbara who was a cultist worshiping the Lovecraftian, two-headed, mystical Nameless Ones. When Dr. Strange fought the Nameless Ones, Barbara sacrificed herself to save him, trapping herself in the hell dimension. Dr. Strange and the Defenders accidentally return to the Nameless Ones\u2019 realm to free Barbara, only to discover that loneliness has driven her to become the Nameless Ones\u2019 \u201cmate,\u201d as she puts it.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nThe Defenders separate Barbara from the Nameless Ones, but this drives her insane. They escape with her into yet another mystical realm, where they\u2019re captured and thrown in prison alongside the old Thor villain the Enchantress. The Enchantress casts a spell, placing the consciousness of the super-feminist Valkyrie inside Barbara\u2019s brain.\nSo Valkyrie is a feminist-empowered warrior-personality artificially grafted onto a woman driven mad by being sexually abused by a monster from outside space and time. As you\u2019d expect, her characterization vacillated wildly. Sometimes she was presented as confident and strong, boldly shutting down her teammates\u2019 silly chauvinism. At other times, she was written as if her feminism was a kind of false-consciousness alien imposition, making her act belligerent and prickly in spite of herself.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nObviously, Valkyrie, with her convoluted origin and metal bustier, is miles away from the pavement-pounding New York crime-fighters of the Netflix series.\nStill, the introduction of the character began moving the Defenders in a marginally more conventional super-direction. Suffering from amnesia and without any friends, Valkyrie \u2014 unlike the Hulk, Namor, and the Surfer \u2014 actually wanted to be part of a permanent Defenders team. She even moved into Dr. Strange\u2019s home for a while. (Dr. Strange\u2019s girlfriend disapproved, presumably because writer Steve Engleheart was looking for drama.)\nEventually, more conventional heroes joined up as well, including Hawkeye (briefly) and Nighthawk, a former supervillain transparently modeled on Batman. (The Hulk charmingly refers to him as \u201cBird-nose.\u201d) Namor and Silver Surfer drifted off, taking their exposed pecs with them. \nSteve Gerber picked up writing chores in 1974. Gerber, best known for creating Howard the Duck, had his own sense of the absurd, though it was more self-aware than the earliest let\u2019s-throw-Namor-at-the-Hulk-and-see-what-happens approach.\nGerber also had a weakness for more conventional, awkward soap opera dynamics. Nighthawk develops a crush on Valkyrie. Valkyrie discovers her amnesia caused her to forget her husband. Nighthawk snarks petulantly, because Valkyrie\u2019s trauma is all about him. And so on.\nThe Defenders comic had plenty of other permutations over the years. Dr. Strange remained a constant, for the most part, as Gargoyle, Hellcat \u2014 and yes, Luke Cage \u2014 rotated in and out. Even if there\u2019s some vague commonality in personnel, though, the television show doesn\u2019t draw on any era of comic book Defenders, and certainly not on the first. That\u2019s for the best, overall; the early comics are an enjoyable mess, but Valkyrie\u2019s origin, for example, doesn\u2019t need to be reproduced for contemporary television viewers. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: Marvel Comics\n\n\n\nWhether you love the new Defenders series or hate it, it\u2019s bound to be more coherent than the comics it took its name from. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but I will miss Namor boasting about how he\u2019s better than the other fish, and Hulk musing about his mittens. \n\n"}
