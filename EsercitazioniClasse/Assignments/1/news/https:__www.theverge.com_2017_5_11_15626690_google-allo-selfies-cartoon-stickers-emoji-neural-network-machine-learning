The finished product is a variety of different stickers featuring your newly minted cartoon doppelg\u00e4nger to use in future Allo chats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Google\u2019s research blog reveals some interesting methodology behind the seemingly simple integration, as the company describes the efforts it had to take to avoid the uncanny valley and ensure that people of all races, genders, and ages were represented across the generated illustrations.\nThe new selfie-to-sticker tool should be rolling out today for Allo on Android, with an iOS release coming soon. \n"}
