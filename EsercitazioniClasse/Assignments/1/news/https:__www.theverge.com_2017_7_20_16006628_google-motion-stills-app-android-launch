{"title": "Google brings Motion Stills to Android, where it\u2019s all motion and no stills", "content": " \nA full year after launching on iOS, Google\u2019s Motion Stills app has arrived on Android \u2014 but in pretty much a completely different form.\nMotion Stills on iOS is meant to be a really easy way to turn the iPhone\u2019s Live Photos into shareable GIFs \u2014 and it\u2019s pretty great at that. But Android doesn\u2019t have Live Photos, so the new Motion Stills is basically just a camera app that exports GIFs.\nThe app can take two different types of shots. The first, which Google calls a \u201cmotion still,\u201d is just a three second video loop. It\u2019s kind of puzzling, because it seems like this is meant to be an alternative to Live Photos \u2014 it even records the same length of footage. But there\u2019s not actually a photo involved. Which is weird, because the feature is called \u201cmotion still,\u201d but there is only motion, and no still.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\nThe second type of shot is called a \u201cfast forward,\u201d and this one is a little more interesting. It\u2019s basically a Google-made alternative to Instagram\u2019s Hyperlapse app, which has never been brought to Android. Like Hyperlapse, Google\u2019s fast forward mode lets you record a video, then automatically stabilizes that video and can speed it up from twice to eight times the original speed. In a nice touch, you can keep changing the fast forward speed even after the video is shot and saved, whereas Instagram\u2019s app only gives you one chance to choose a video\u2019s speed.\nThis is far from the only option for taking hyperlapse-style shots on Android. Microsoft even released an app called Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile. Google\u2019s option seems to work well enough, though it took a minute for the app to process a video I took that was only about 25 seconds long. Its stabilization doesn\u2019t look great at lower speeds, either \u2014 though faster motion seems to hide the jumpiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\nI\u2019m kind of confused why Google didn\u2019t just make this into an alternative camera app that took Live Photos, then let people who wanted them make it their default shooting app. As it is, I can\u2019t really see myself ever using this, unless I wanted to make a hyperlapse. There are plenty of ways to make GIFs on mobile already \u2014 and others are way more fun. Google even has a bunch of more interesting creative options in Motion Stills on iOS, like an option to make cinemagraphs and add moving text, but neither of those made it to Android.\n"}
