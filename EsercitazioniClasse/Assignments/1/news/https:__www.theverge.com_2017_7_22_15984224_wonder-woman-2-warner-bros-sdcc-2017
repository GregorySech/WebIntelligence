{"title": "Wonder Woman 2 officially announced at Comic-Con", "content": " \nComing off Wonder Woman\u2019s success at the box office this summer, Warner Bros. has officially confirmed that Wonder Woman 2 is now in the works. Word came via a sizzle reel shown during the studio\u2019s Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con.\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better for a Wonder Woman sequel. The original, which opened just a month ago, is already the third biggest Warner Bros. movie of all time, behind only The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. The film is also the highest-grossing live action film from a female director, shattering the stereotypes that have kept women from directing blockbusters for years.\n"}
