{"title": "Big, powerful, and roomy: these are the most popular cars for self-driving experiments", "content": " \nYesterday, someone spotted one of Apple\u2019s newly licensed self-driving cars puttering around in Silicon Valley, and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 it was a white Lexus RX450h. This wasn\u2019t a total shock \u2014 after all, Apple registered three Lexus SUVs with the California DMV for autonomous driving earlier this month. \nBut the extent of Lexus\u2019 popularity among those conducting self-driving experiments is pretty amazing. Not only is Apple using the luxury car brand as a platform to test its software, but so are many other operators. It\u2019s essentially a free advertisement for Lexus\u2019 parent company, Toyota (which prefers the Lexus LS 600hL for its own self-driving tests). \nLexus RX SUV is the top choice among driverless operators\nLexus may be the most high-profile brand on the road but there are other makes and models used for self-driving tests by companies playing in this space, including the Ford Fusion (Uber, Udacity, and obviously Ford) and the Lincoln MKZ (Faraday Future, Drive.ai). Volvo\u2019s safety record makes it a popular choice as well. \nWhat goes into the decision-making process for choosing a self-driving test car? Battery capacity, cargo space, and all-wheel drive are just some of the considerations made by self-driving operators. According to Sam Abuelsamid, senior analyst at Navigant, the higher the autonomy of the vehicle, the more electricity required to power the car\u2019s self-driving hardware.\n\u201cA conventional [internal combustion engine] vehicle with a 12-volt electrical system only offers about 2.5 kilowatt of electrical power max and on most modern cars they are close to maxed out,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cHighly automated vehicles (Level 4 and up) will probably require 48V systems at a minimum.\u201d\nBrand familiarity is another driving factor. Both the Lexus RX and Ford Fusion have been around for so long, their hardware is \u201cpretty well understood\u201d by many in the tech world, Abuelsamid said. \n\u201cFor years people having been hacking older Priuses to convert them [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles],\u201d he added. \u201cFord Fusions are also widely used by Ford as well as Uber for pretty much the same reason, available and understood. Some companies such as Nvidia are using the Lincoln MKZ which is mechanically identical to the Fusion.\u201d\nAnd the space required by autonomous vehicles is huge. All those sensors, processing, and upgraded actuators take up a ton of space. Abuelsamid shared this photo of the trunk of one of Ford\u2019s autonomous Fusions to drive home the point about why SUVs and minivans are so popular these days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sam Abuelsamid\n\n\nWhat is everyone else using? Here is our best effort at compiling a comprehensive list. There are over two dozen companies licensed for autonomous testing in California alone, and we\u2019re on the lookout for the next model  \u2014 another SUV or something a little sassier. \nWaymo (n\u00e9e Google): Chrysler Pacifica and Lexus SUV\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUber: Ford Fusion and Volvo XC90\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple: Lexus RX450h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia Bloomberg\n\n\nNuTonomy: Renault Zoes and Mitsubishi i-MiEV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: nuTonomy\n\n\nBaidu: BMW and BAIC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUdacity: Lincoln MKZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFord: Ford Fusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors: Chevy Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosch: Tesla Model S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelphi: Audi SQ5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia: Audi Q7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComma.ai: Acura ILX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNissan: Nissan Leaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo: Volvo XC90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least... the Google car \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
