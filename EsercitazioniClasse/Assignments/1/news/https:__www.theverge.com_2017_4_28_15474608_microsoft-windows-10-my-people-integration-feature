{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s latest Windows 10 preview lets you pin contacts to the taskbar", "content": " \nMicrosoft was supposed to ship contact integration with its Windows 10 Creators Update, but the software maker mysteriously delayed the feature. While we\u2019ve been waiting to see when it would appear, Microsoft is now testing it with its latest preview build of Windows 10 (16184). The My People feature allows Windows 10 users to pin contacts to the taskbar, and access chat apps and conversations easily. It\u2019s a major change to the taskbar user interface, and one that will require a lot of feedback and testing from Microsoft\u2019s 10 million Windows Insiders.\nAlongside the new people feature, Microsoft is also bringing the best mail and calendar features of Windows 10 to Gmail users. That means Google accounts in the built-in Mail app will now support Focused Inbox to filter out important emails, and the calendar app will display travel reservations and package delivery details. These features were previously only for Outlook.com and Office 365 accounts, but Microsoft is now extending them to Google\u2019s popular email service.\nAs always, you\u2019ll need to be a Windows Insider on the fast ring to access the preview builds of Windows 10. Microsoft has listed a number of known issues with this preview, and it\u2019s only at the early stage of testing what will become its next major update to Windows 10. Microsoft is expected to reveal new features for this release of Windows 10 at the company\u2019s Build conference next month, and has committed to releasing this next update in September.\n"}
