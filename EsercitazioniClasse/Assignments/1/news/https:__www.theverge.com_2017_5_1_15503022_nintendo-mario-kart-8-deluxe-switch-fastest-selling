{"title": "Nintendo says Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Switch is fastest seller in series history", "content": " \nNintendo has announced that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for its Switch console is the fastest-selling title in the history of the entire series. The company says it recorded a total of 459,000 combined sales \u2014 both digital and physical retail copies \u2014 in the US on the game's April 28th launch day. \nThe numbers result in an attach rate of 45 percent, so \u201cnearly one in two Nintendo Switch owners in the U.S. purchased a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the first day it was available.\u201d Put differently, clearly people were really excited for another, very good Switch game to play besides Zelda, Snipperclips, and a couple decent indie releases since launch. \nThe previous record holder was Mario Kart Wii back in 2008, which sold 433,900 on its first day. Mario Kart 8 for Wii U, which the Deluxe version expands on, has cumulatively sold 8.31 million copies so far \u2014 but that version has been available for nearly three years. Its launch momentum was definitely slower; Nintendo waited five weeks to announce sales of 885,000 units in the US. The Switch version did more than half that total in a single day. Pretty impressive. Nintendo says over 2.7 million Switch consoles have been sold globally so far. \n"}
