{"title": "Watch an animated history of YouTube\u2019s homepage", "content": " \n4096, a YouTube channel that mostly makes animated histories of gadgets like Nintendo consoles and Nokia phones, has most recently published a history of all the changes YouTube has made to its homepage since 2005.\nThe video, at two minutes long, is a nice length for a documentary, in my opinion. It\u2019s nice to start doing a task and be done with it just two minutes later. \ni\u2019m sad\nHowever, this task is also going to make you a little bit sad. The original YouTube homepage surfaced weird, obviously homemade uploads. Even as it grew enough to warrant sections for spotlighting featured videos, the selections were delightfully bizarre. Until about 2007. That\u2019s when you start to see viral acoustic song covers and boring, mammoth channels like \u201cWill it Blend?\u201d creeping into the first results. From there, it takes almost no time at all for the page to sift through a dozen or so barely different iterations on the YouTube we know now \u2014 an algorithmically curated selection of music videos, movie trailers, and channels with subscriptions well in the millions. And of course, there\u2019s a huge banner ad. \nAnyway, \u201cThe Evolution of YouTube\u201d is nice if you want to briefly remember the weird internet and kill two minutes before doing a different task. Maybe you\u2019ll catch a glimpse of something you used to love and it will remind you to look it up and watch that. Now there goes another few minutes, and congratulations on not dealing with the rest of your day. \n\nI don\u2019t really care if this video is lame. I always thought it was so funny. Particularly when I was 15. Feel free to watch whichever old YouTube thing you personally prefer.\n"}
