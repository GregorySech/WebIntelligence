{"title": "Essential Phones will begin shipping within a week", "content": " \nThe first Essential phones will start shipping in a week\u2019s time, according to emails sent by the company to early buyers. 9to5Google reports that Essential sent messages to customers who pre-registered for the phone. However, the messages say that only the black version of device (\u2018Black Moon\u2019) will ship \u201cwithin 7 days\u201d, while shipment for the white version (\u2018Pure White\u2019) is still \u201ca couple of weeks away.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no exact release date for the phone either, but hopefully these emails mean that will be coming very soon. We\u2019ve had a pretty good look at the device, but expectations are running high considering that the man behind Essential, Andy Rubin, is better known as the founder of Android. Investors too have been swept up in the excitement, with news coming this week that Essential is already a unicorn \u2014 a startup valued at more than a billion dollars. \nA billion dollars, but zero phones shipped. Let\u2019s hope that changes soon. \n\n\nConfirmed my @essential phone order but what happened to the 360 cam guys? My order is $49 and a camera short... pic.twitter.com/fYDxbbcrZW\u2014 Anshel Sag (@anshelsag) August 16, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
