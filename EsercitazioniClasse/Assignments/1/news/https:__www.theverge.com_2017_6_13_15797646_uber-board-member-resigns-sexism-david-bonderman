David Bonderman\u2019s resignation from Uber\u2019s board was first announced by The New York Times, and confirmed in a statement by Bonderman himself, in which he said his comment was \u201ccareless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.\u201d\nBonderman was recorded making the remark in reply to to fellow board member Arianna Huffington, who was speaking about the need for more female representation on Uber\u2019s board. When \u201cthere\u2019s one woman on the board, it\u2019s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,\u201d Huffington said, to which Bonderman shot back \u201cwhat it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201d\n\n\nbonderman statement pic.twitter.com/JnP935pq3T\u2014 \u0ca0_\u0ca0 (@MikeIsaac) June 14, 2017\n\n\n\nBonderman \u2014 who helped found TPG, a private equity firm \u2014 said that the comment \u201ccame across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended,\u201d but that he understood \u201cthe destructive effect it had,\u201d and that he took full responsibility for it. \nUber is currently considering the findings of the so-called Holder Report: an internal investigation into claims of sexual harassment and a toxic sexist attitude within the company.
