{"title": "Katy Perry's new video feeds a hamster a decadent tiny dinner", "content": " \nKaty Perry\u2019s latest music video, \u201cChained To The Rhythm,\u201d delivers a strange combination of chillwave, bubbly pop, and thinly veiled political woes. But it\u2019s the visuals that have caught our eye. The video is a perfect example of one of the internet\u2019s favorite cute subcultures. \nTiny food is an absolute joy. This is a proven fact. Such bliss can only be topped when said tiny food is eaten by the cutest of all tiny creatures, a hamster. It\u2019s an award-winning trend that became so popular it was made into a book. Perry\u2019s video is a musical riff on the craze, a tiny cooking show that ends in a TV dinner in which hamster Mr. Parsons gorges on miniature fries, tacos, hot dogs, pasta, and what I think is some sort of pizza. \nThe video itself is a bright spot of joy, even when coupled with a tacky hamster cartoon that bounces merrily over the captions of Perry\u2019s dread-filled lyrics. Such is the power of tiny things in the not-so-tiny struggle many face these days in remaining positive. \n\n"}
