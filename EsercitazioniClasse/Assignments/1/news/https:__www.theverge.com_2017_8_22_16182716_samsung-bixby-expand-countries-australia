It\u2019s already available in South Korea and the US, where it rolled out in July after months of delays. The voice assistant is billed as \u201can intelligent interface to help get things done faster and easier,\u201d but in our own tests we found that Bixby struggles with basic commands, and concluded that it\u2019s easier to just use the touchscreen.\nBixby is available in US English and Korean, and Samsung claims the voice assistant learns over time, improving its function as it recognizes your way of speaking. \u201cThe expansion of Bixby\u2019s voice capabilities is an initial step in the continued rollout of Bixby functionality,\u201d said Injong Rhee, executive vice president at Samsung Electronics in a press statement. \u201cIn the future, Bixby will have the learning power to offer more intelligent and personalized interactions and seamless connections across more devices.\u201d\nSamsung says Bixby will be made available in more countries, languages, devices, and third-party applications over time. Galaxy S8 and S8+ users can access Bixby by pressing the dedicated Bixby button on those phones, or by saying \u201cHi, Bixby.\u201d The roll-out comes in a big week for Samsung, with the Galaxy Note 8 set to be officially unveiled tomorrow in New York City. \n\n\n\n"}
