{"title": "When your child\u2019s favorite YouTube celebrity is a secret racist", "content": " \nI\u2019m not a parent, but I feel like I took a step into legitimate adulthood earlier this month when my wife and I spent a weekend babysitting a friend\u2019s two-year-old. Happily he was an easy kid to look after, but he\u2019s still a two-year-old, and as I discovered (and you parents already know), he required near-constant surveillance. If we wanted a moment of freedom \u2014 to cook, to grab a drink, to go to the bathroom \u2014 then the only surefire option was to park him in front of YouTube. \nHis channel of choice was Little Baby Bum. It\u2019s a giant in the world of kids\u2019 YouTube, with nearly 10 million subscribers and almost 500 videos, each one setting a simple song to cheerful 3D animations. As far as kids shows go, it\u2019s markedly inoffensive, using classic nursery rhymes and little branding, but it still had an incredible effect on his young mind. The opening of the YouTube app induced almost total silence: an almost-religious trance that seemed guaranteed to last as long as the playlist ran. Throughout, his only noise was a reverent sigh when he saw the channel\u2019s mascot appear, no matter how many different variants of \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d he endured in a row.\n\nI thought of this digital panacea again this week with the news that YouTube video gaming personality JonTron had made several racist and anti-semitic statements. JonTron \u2014 real name Jon Jafari \u2014 started his week by tweeting support for Iowa representative Steve King on Sunday, after King made the troubling claim that \u201cwe can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.\u201d Jafari then doubled down on this stance in an interview with fellow streamer Steven \u201cDestiny\u201d Bonnell, complaining of the erosion of a \u201cunifying culture\u201d in the United States, portraying Black Lives Matter as violent terrorists, and repeatedly making portentous warnings that white people would become the minority in American society.\n\n\nWow, how scandalous, Steve King doesn't want his country invaded by people who have contempt for his culture and people! NAZI!!!\u2014 Jon Jafari (@JonTronShow) March 12, 2017\n\n\n\nThese statements are troubling enough on their own, but they\u2019re particularly strange from the mouth of the mop-headed Jafari, who\u2019s best known for yelping theatrically at video games, and who\u2019s major audience is young people. I first came across Jafari\u2019s videos about five years ago, when he was a member of a collective of YouTube Let\u2019s Play-ers called the Game Grumps. In the intervening years, I was dimly aware, Jafari either left or was excised from the Grumps, building up his own YouTube network and prodigious subscriber count with video game-focused clips, skits, and commentaries.\nBut at some point along the way he was apparently radicalized by the far-right (or at the very least adopted their talking points). I don\u2019t think as a general rule that entertainers should be forcibly cut off from their politics \u2014 art and entertainment don\u2019t exist in a vacuum \u2014 but Jafari\u2019s heel turn to white nationalism is difficult to swallow when he has such unalloyed access to millions of children. Jafari\u2019s been making videos for long enough that, for a generation raised on iPads and smartphones rather than TVs and movie screens, he\u2019s had the time to cement himself as a much-loved figure. It\u2019s like if Mister Rogers started distributing KKK literature around his neighborhood, or if Bill Nye announced that the Moon landing was faked by Jewish people. \n\nJafari\u2019s case is a harder echo of Felix \u201cPewdiepie\u201d Kjellberg\u2019s recent videos, in which he paid two Indian men to hold a banner reading \u201cdeath to Jews,\u201d and was subsequently dropped by the Disney-owned Maker Studios. Kjellberg argued that he used the phrase for shock, and unlike Jafari, backed very quickly away from any serious right-wing views. While his actions were foul, his argument was at least partially convincing: I don\u2019t honestly think that Pewdiepie is an ardent racist, and it\u2019s certainly not the first time he has defaulted to shock to dig for humor in his videos.\nBut I also don\u2019t think that his tens of millions of teen and pre-teen fans will immediately identify his antics as a nuanced criticism of the gig economy and global inequality, as he has insinuated. A sizable percentage will instead see their favorite celebrity in the world making the same funny faces he pulls at video games to a banner calling for genocide, and \u2014 having already been hardcoded over the last five years of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s videos to read Kjellberg\u2019s faces of shock and surprise as comedy \u2014 decide that those heinous words are now the height of playground hilarity. \nAnecdotal evidence pointed out by Waypoint suggests that\u2019s already happening. Under a post detailing JonTron\u2019s Destiny interview, one Gizmodo commenter shared a story about his girlfriend\u2019s young nephews, both of whom made joking references to \u201cbashing Jews\u201d and Hitler. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned all this stupidity from these dumb fucking YouTube Minecraft streamers and repeat it mindlessly,\u201d the commenter said. \u201cThink about how many children are out here learning all this horrible shit like it\u2019s normal.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an argument that parents should be limiting what kids can watch on YouTube in the same way that a sensible parent would stop a four-year-old from watching a horror movie, but that\u2019s nearly impossible in this day and age. YouTube is physically different, for one, appearing on phones in pockets and in playgrounds in a way a CRT TV never could. Some parents will use YouTube almost as much as their kids, but for others, there\u2019s also a pronounced generational disconnect that means they just don\u2019t get the medium, how it works, or the way it\u2019s becoming the dominant form of entertainment for many kids. Add to that the fact that there\u2019s just so much on the site, and its video creators are so prodigious, that even if you understand it completely, keeping up with your kid\u2019s media consumption could be a full-time job.\nParents see video games on screen and \u201cit\u2019s not a red flag\u201d\nOn YouTube, these fringe opinions are insidious, too. They\u2019re not set to Leni Riefenstahl films or videos of the Nuremberg Rallies \u2014 they dribble out during video game streams, or in Twitch chat, or in YouTube\u2019s never-ending \u201cup next\u201d queue. These are ostensibly benign spaces that have become politicized in recent years, but not so loudly that the average parent will be able to clock the association. As the Gizmodo commenter notes, the kids\u2019 parents see video games and \u201cit\u2019s not a red flag.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s easy enough to vet what a two-year-old is watching \u2014 they can\u2019t work the Fire Stick controls \u2014 and child-friendly YouTube and Kindle apps lock off more adult content entirely. But what happens when these kids grow up enough to develop fine motor skills and graduate beyond nursery rhymes? How best to monitor and curb this negative influence when it is found? Checking viewing histories provides a general overview, but in Jafari\u2019s case, a glance at his channel would reveal his interest in video games, with no mention of his fringe politics. And even then, parents are sitting their kids in front of YouTube precisely so they don\u2019t have to watch something banal or repetitive for an hour, so they can get some work done, or have some headspace to themselves. \nGoogle\u2019s recently announced Family Link app may be the first step toward a better option. The app lets parents control device usage remotely, setting bedtimes, controlling app use, and even remotely locking it. But the app is still not a curator, and it still can\u2019t filter by \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d \u201canti-semite,\u201d or similar terms. \nUntil they get those tools, today\u2019s parents still have to walk a difficult line, balancing quiet time and their child\u2019s independence with the knowledge that they may be influenced by questionable people who live in their pockets. \n"}
