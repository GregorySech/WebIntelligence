{"title": "Why scare tactics won't stop climate change", "content": " \nSome climate scientists are pushing back against a bleak portrayal of the coming climate apocalypse that was published Sunday night in New York magazine. The cover story\u2019s vivid and doom-heavy forecast won\u2019t help the fight against climate change, they argue. In fact, it\u2019s possible these scare tactics could do just the opposite.\nThe story, the \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth,\u201d trails the four horsemen as they thunder after runaway carbon emissions. Natural disasters could become so common that \u201cwe will just start calling them \u2018weather,\u2019\u201d journalist David Wallace-Wells writes. New and long-dead viruses might emerge from thawing ice. Famine and mass migrations may fuel wars. And parts of the Earth could become almost uninhabitable by the end of the century. \n\u201cTruly scary information has a nasty tendency to get ignored.\u201d\nTo put it mildly, it\u2019s an unsettling take on the future of our planet \u2014 and people are paying attention. The story has been shared more than 375,000 times on Facebook, Crowdtangle reports. But some climate scientists say that the piece describes extreme and unlikely worst-case scenarios. And just as there\u2019s a danger in understating the risks of climate change, climate scientist Michael Mann wrote on Facebook, \u201c[T]here is also a danger in overstating the science in a way that presents the problem as unsolvable, and feeds a sense of doom, inevitability, and hopelessness.\u201d\n\n\nWhat's written's actually beyond worst possible case. THIS is the \"alarmism\" we get accused of. It's important to speak out against it.\u2014 Eric Steig (@ericsteig) July 10, 2017\n\n\n\nThis critique is a wake-up call for journalists, like me. Covering climate change can feel frustratingly like screaming into the void. In the face of climate denial, the temptation is to yell louder about more frightening consequences. \u201cI look at the world we live in now and it seems to me like complacency is just so much of a bigger problem when it comes to responding to climate change than fatalism,\u201d Wallace-Wells says in an interview with The Verge. \u201cThere are probably some people who are \u2018burnt out\u2019 or who have \u2018given up,\u2019 but I think the much bigger issue is that in general the public doesn\u2019t appreciate the kind of threat we face.\u201d\nThe public\u2019s certainly listening now \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing, says Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. \u201cI applaud every journalistic effort to report on climate change,\u201d he says in an email to The Verge. \u201cThe biggest problem is the \u2018climate silence\u2019 in America.\u201d But the balance between sharing alarming information, and being alarmist, is tricky. \nTo be clear, the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is real and dangerous, that we\u2019re driving it, and that we can and should fight it. The question is whether apocalyptic climate change narratives are the best way to communicate these dangers. \nScare tactics can backfire when people put up their psychological defenses\nResearch about the persuasiveness of scare tactics is somewhat mixed. Some argue that in certain situations, scary stories can make people change their ways \u2014 especially if those changes are easy, and the stories not overly frightening. But the balance of evidence seems to lean more heavily on the side that fear by itself just isn\u2019t very effective at motivating people to change. (Remember Reefer Madness?) \nIn fact, scare tactics can backfire when people put up their psychological defenses against the threatening information, rather than defending against the threat itself. These can include paying less attention to a frightening message, or straight up denial about the extent of the danger, a 2014 review of the literature reports. \u201cTruly scary information has a nasty tendency to get ignored \u2014 because [people] don't want to learn it or think about it,\u201d Maibach agrees.  \n\u201cThere are some scary scenarios out there.\u201d\nPart of the problem is that people tend to prioritize their lived experiences over abstract, future predictions, like the ones about how climate change could reshape our planet. That\u2019s why Eric Steig, a glaciologist at the University of Washington, doesn\u2019t talk about polar bears when he inevitably finds himself discussing his work on a plane or in a coffee shop. \u201cThe last thing I would want to suggest is to self-censor against some scenarios because they\u2019re scary \u2014 because there are some scary scenarios out there,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it scary if polar bears are going to be extinct? To the extent that you care about that, sure.\u201d In reality, species go extinct all the time, but that affects few people directly. \nInstead, Steig focuses on trying to draw people\u2019s attention to the more mundane and approachable effects of climate change. Like, for example, the fact that engineers on a massive tunnel project in his hometown of Seattle are accounting for future sea level rise. \u201cThat\u2019s a narrative of, \u2018This is a serious issue that we have to take seriously.\u2019 That\u2019s different than \u2018we\u2019re going to die tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he says. He worries that otherwise, hyperbole can strain scientific credibility. \u201cIf they think it\u2019s over the top, which most people would, then they think scientists are over the top,\u201d he says. \u201cSo then they buy into the narrative that scientists are being political, and extreme.\u201d\nEven when scare tactics do grab people\u2019s attention, they need to be paired with clear action items to drive change, the research suggests. When the climate apocalypse movie The Day After Tomorrow hit theaters in 2004, researchers surveyed viewers. Initially, Jake Gyllenhaal's plight boosted people\u2019s concern about climate change and most felt that \u201ceveryone has to do something.\u201d But that \u201csomething\u201d wasn\u2019t clear. After a month, viewers\u2019 sense of urgency retreated. One particularly self-aware viewer responded, \u201cUnfortunately I have to say that my awareness and involvement and concern will fade away until the next thing triggers it to the forefront.\u201d\n\u201cMy awareness and involvement and concern will fade away until the next thing triggers it.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Maibach recommends dialing back the fear, and dialing up messages of hope and the efficacy of individual actions, like buying from companies that run on clean energy, and using energy-efficient products. \u201cThere is no magic bullet to solve these challenges,\u201d Maibach says in an email. \u201cBut we do know that people do tend to learn simple clear messages (about problems) that get repeated often by a variety of people whom they trust.\u201d\nAtmospheric scientist Andrew Dessler agrees. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to not discourage people \u2014 you don\u2019t want to go from denial to despair,\u201d he says. Dessler, however, has a somewhat more cynical view on individual, virtuous action. \u201cIndividual actions are not going to make a huge amount of difference,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the things that do help are voting for elected representatives that share your concern for the climate.\u201d \nIn the end, even though they may disagree about the best strategy, climate scientists and Wallace-Wells agree that there\u2019s an urgent need to convince readers to care about climate change. \u201cOne raindrop doesn\u2019t carve a canyon, but enough raindrops will,\u201d Dessler says. It will take a flood of raindrops to start carving away at climate change. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll win soon enough that we can avoid the worst-case scenarios.\u201d\n\n"}
