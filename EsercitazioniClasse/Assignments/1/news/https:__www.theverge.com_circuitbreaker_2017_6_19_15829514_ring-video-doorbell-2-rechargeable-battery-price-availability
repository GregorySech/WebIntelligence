{"title": "Ring's latest Video Doorbell makes charging easier with a swappable battery", "content": " \nRing continues to make minor improvements to its popular line of smart video doorbells. Last year was the Video Doorbell Pro, which added 1080p video and configurable motion-detection zones, but didn't run on battery power. The new Video Doorbell 2 has 1080p and motion zones, but returns to Ring's easy-to-install roots with a rechargeable battery.\nIn fact, you can finally swap out the doorbell's battery, so if you have two batteries in rotation, you can keep your doorbell online 24/7 without bothering to wire it up to power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Video Doorbell 2 also brings the price back down to $199 (compared to $250 for the Pro), and includes features like swappable faceplates (black and white are included). Live video, two-way audio, and mobile alerts are obviously all here. A cloud-based video-recording plan is still an extra monthly expense after the initial 30-day trial.\nVideo Doorbell 2 is available now.\n"}
