{"title": "Everything coming to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now in November", "content": " \nNovember is nearly upon us, and when this whole \u201cdress up as scary monsters\u201d business is over, it will be time for a new month of movies and television shows from your streaming service of choice. (That\u2019s assuming you\u2019ve already watched all of Stranger Things season 2. If you haven\u2019t, you should probably just do that right now before the internet ruins every single secret about the show.)\nUsually, we try to tease out an overarching theme every month with these roundups, but there really isn\u2019t one this time around. Netflix, as usual, is leaning heavily into original programming. Its new series Alias Grace, based on the Margaret Atwood novel of the same name, is coming on November 3rd, with the second season of Lady Dynamite arriving a week later. On the superhero side, The Punisher will premiere on November 17th, with the series adaptation of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It coming to the service on the 23rd. There will also be some original movies as well, with one of our favorites from this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, Mudbound, premiering on November 17th. The service will lose a selection of films on November 1st, however, so if you want to watch the Matrix trilogy on Netflix, you\u2019ve got no time to lose.\nAmazon Prime Video will add critical favorite The Big Sick to its lineup on November 24th. But the service will continue to improve its legacy movie library selection as well. Nearly all the (pre-Daniel Craig) James Bond franchise is coming to the service, and if you\u2019re interested in holding onto that gothy, Halloween spirit just a little longer, the service will also have Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula available starting November 1st.\nAs for HBO\u2026 well, HBO is playing things right down the middle. It\u2019s adding The Lego Batman Movie, Jordan Peele\u2019s exceptional Get Out, and Kong: Skull Island to its offerings. It\u2019s not all good news, though: Independence Day, Dragnet, Parenthood, and more will leave the service on November 30th \u2014 which means you now know exactly what to throw on the television to occupy your family during this year\u2019s Thanksgiving festivities. \nComing to Netflix\nNovember 1st\n\n42 \nCasper \nChappie \nCharlotte's Web\nField of Dreams \nMen in Black \nMichael Clayton\nOculus\nScary Movie \nSilent Hill \n\nStranger, season 1\nThe Bittersweet \nThe Pursuit of Happyness \nThe Reader \nThe Whole Nine Yards \nTo Rome with Love \n\nUnder Arrest, season 17\nUndercover Grandpa \nWhere the Day Takes You \n\nNovember 2nd\n\nAll About the Money \nIt's Not Yet Dark \n\nTen Percent (aka Call My Agent!), season 2\n\nNovember 3rd\n\nAlias Grace\nEventual Salvation \n\nThe Big Family Cooking Showdown, season 1\n\nNovember 4th\nWilliams \nNovember 5th\n\nThe Homesman \nThe Veil \n\nNovember 6th\nThe Dinner \nNovember 7th\n\nDizzy & Bop's Big Adventure: The Great Music Caper \n\nFate/Apocrypha, part 1\nKilling Ground \n\nP.
