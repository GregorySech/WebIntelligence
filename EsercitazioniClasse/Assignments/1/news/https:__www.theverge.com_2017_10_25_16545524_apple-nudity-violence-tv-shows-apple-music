{"title": "Apple reportedly won\u2019t allow nudity or violence in its TV shows", "content": " \nIf you were expecting Game of Thrones-type shows to come from Apple\u2019s original video content push, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple will not allow its upcoming shows to feature nudity, strong language, or violence. Instead, the company wants to focus on comedies and dramas like This Is Us and Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amazing Stories that can appeal to a wider audience. \nThe decision, according to Bloomberg, has led producers and partners to label Apple as \u201cconservative and picky,\u201d and Apple\u2019s recent moves have backed up that assertion. Earlier this year, Tim Cook delayed the release of Carpool Karaoke to remove \u201cfoul language and references to vaginal hygiene\u201d from some episodes, according to the report. Recode says one of the episodes that featured comedian Chelsea Handler and singer Blake Shelton almost didn\u2019t air because Cook thought the conversation was \u201ctoo raunchy\u201d for Apple\u2019s viewers. The episode ultimately aired after it was edited. \nProducers and partners have labeled Apple as \u201cconservative and picky\u201d\nApple\u2019s content decisions are one issue, but the larger one is where these shows will live once they\u2019re ready to air. The company will no longer put its shows on Apple Music, as it did with Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, according to Bloomberg\u2019s report. This is probably a good decision for the long-term success of its TV business, as the current shows have essentially been marketing vehicles to boost the subscription of its music service.\nWhere the shows will live is still up in the air, which should make things even more interesting for producers thinking about which service should get their shows. It seems like Apple still needs to iron out its TV plans \u2014 and with a $1 billion budget and an active team looking for new content, it needs to do it sooner rather than later. \n\n"}
