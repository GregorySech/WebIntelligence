{"title": "Sprint opens Essential Phone preorders with a $260 discount", "content": " \nSprint is now taking preorders for the Essential Phone, and it\u2019s offering subscribers a pretty good perk to jump on it early: a discount of about $260.\nNaturally, Sprint being a phone carrier, all kinds of confusing terms and conditions apply here. Sprint is advertising the deal as \u201c50 percent off the Essential Phone,\u201d but that\u2019s not true. What it\u2019s actually doing is giving 50 percent off its standard payment plan, the \u201cSprint Flex 18-month lease.\u201d\nIt\u2019s closer to a 30 percent discount in the end\nThe catch is, at the end of that lease, you don\u2019t actually own the phone. You\u2019ll have only paid off $525 of the phone\u2019s $700 price (though you\u2019ll have paid half that, because of the discount).\nAt that point, you\u2019ll have the option of trading the phone in for something else, which seems like a bad deal, or paying off the remaining $175 so you can actually own the phone. If you do that, you\u2019ll end up paying around $440 in total, which is still a good discount.\nSprint is only offering black versions of the phone right now and says units will ship by August 28th. Essential announced earlier this week that white models of the phone were delayed, and began offering customers the option to switch their order to the phone\u2019s other color.\n"}
