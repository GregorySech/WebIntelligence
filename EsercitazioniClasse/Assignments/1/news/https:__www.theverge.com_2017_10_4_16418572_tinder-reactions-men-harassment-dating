{"title": "Tinder\u2019s new \u2018reaction\u2019 feature is a weak attempt to combat its most horrible male users", "content": " \nTinder is rolling out a puzzling new feature to better help users who encounter aggressive, offensive, or annoying users on its platform. With \u201creactions,\u201d users can send animated responses like applause, an eye-roll, or a thrown drink. \nIn the dating world, online messages can be a way for people to communicate their discomfort or disgust clearly, without fear of the physical danger that women in particular face around strangers. Dating apps can be an easier way to weed out potential bad first dates. Still, those apps are well-documented avenues for obnoxious messages or outright harassment. Tinder requires both people to consent to conversation through mutual swipes, but that doesn\u2019t mean interactions will be even moderately civil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactions feature is Tinder\u2019s way of calling out this bad behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. It\u2019s sassy. It\u2019s satisfying,\u201d the site\u2019s blog declares. The update will also be accompanied by \u201cmessaging standards to all users to set the tone and promote best practices,\u201d though the company did not provide clarification to The Verge before publication.\nThe reactions feature seems perfectly suited to flirting on Tinder. I have no doubt that sending a little heart, or a ball for a not so subtle \u201cball\u2019s in your court,\u201d will be a useful tool for some people. But offering it as a potential solution for dealing with harassment is tone-deaf. A cute animation isn\u2019t a dynamic way to respond to a gross message; tossing a cartoon martini onto someone\u2019s screen after they ask for nudes or call me a conceited bitch doesn\u2019t sound empowering. At best, it turns people\u2019s inability to treat women as actual humans into a joke. At worst, it infantilizes Tinder\u2019s self-proclaimed douchebag problem.\nTinder reactions could have the potential to shame bad users, and the implementation of such a feature suggests that even Tinder knows it\u2019s important. It\u2019s clear this feature, despite being usable by everyone, is for the women. But the kind of men who respond to \u201cHello\u201d by demanding anal sex have already proved that they don\u2019t have any respect for the social contract or personal boundaries. They aren\u2019t going to be dissuaded or shamed away from future infractions by an emoji eye-roll. \nUnless the stronger reactions, like a strike three or the martini throw, are accompanied by an auto-block, they still suggest women are open to talking after a grossly offensive message. That\u2019s a condescending, milquetoast way to convey violated boundaries. Why settle for the Fisher-Price write-off when you can communicate your feelings clearly with two simple words? \u201cFuck off\u201d is the only reaction any douchebag deserves.\n"}
