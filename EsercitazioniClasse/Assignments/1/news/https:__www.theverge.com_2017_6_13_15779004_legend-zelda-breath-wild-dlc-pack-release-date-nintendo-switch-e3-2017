{"title": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u2019s first DLC pack is coming on June 30th", "content": " \nNintendo detailed what to expect from the first of the two DLC packs for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild back in May, and now we know when we\u2019ll be able to get it: June 30th. \nThe first DLC expansion, The Master Trials, will include several new additions to the base game, including a new \u201cTrial of the Sword\u201d mode, where players will be forced to fight waves of enemies, but without any of their existing equipment that they\u2019ve gathered over the course of their play-through. Completing the trial will power up the Master Sword further, allowing it to deal double damage at all times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a new \u201cMaster Mode\u201d \u2014 i.e., hard mode \u2014 will be added, which increases the difficult by upgrading all the enemies found in the game (some of whom will now take to the sky on flying rafts), along with a variety of new armors and costumes inspired by earlier Zelda titles. \nNintendo also gave a brief teaser of the second DLC pack for Breath of the Wild, scheduled to release this holiday season. Titled \u201cThe Champions\u2019 Ballad\u201d, the expansion will somehow involve the four Champions \u2014  Daruk, Mipha, Revali and Urbosa \u2014 although more details on that are still forthcoming. New Amiibo figures based on the four Champions are also in the works. \n"}
