{"title": "Oculus is now selling its Rift headset to businesses with a new bundle", "content": " Oculus VR now plans on selling its high-end Rift headset to businesses, the company announced today at the Oculus Connect developer conference in San Jose, California. It\u2019s the first time Oculus has sold its Rift headset specifically for commercial purposes. The Oculus Rift for Business bundle costs $900, and includes the headset, Oculus Touch Controllers, three room sensors, an Oculus remote, and three Rift Fits.  Given that all the included hardware costs $574 on its own, it seems that the rest of the $900 price tag for businesses is for the advantages of the expanded warranty, commercial use license, and \u201cpreferential customer service\u201d that Oculus is offering in the business bundle. Price aside, it\u2019s still telling that the company is looking to expand to business sales in the first place, which could help spark more commercial implementations of VR. "}
