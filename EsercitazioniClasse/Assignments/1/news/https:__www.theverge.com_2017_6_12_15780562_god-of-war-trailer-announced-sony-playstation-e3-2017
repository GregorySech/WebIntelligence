{"title": "The new God of War trailer has it all: action, sea monsters, and father and son bonding time", "content": " \nSony showcased all-new gameplay footage for the upcoming God of War reboot, which is bringing back protagonist and antihero Kratos and the franchise\u2019s signature brutal hack-and-slash combat to a new Norse mythology setting. This God of War reboot, from Sony\u2019s Santa Monica Studio, was first announced at the company\u2019s E3 press conference last year. We knew then that the franchise would be transitioning from Greek mythology to ancient Norse myths, with a renewed focus on Kratos\u2019 relationship with his apparent son Atreus. \nIn an exciting potential hint at the nature of the game\u2019s narrative, the new trailer ended with Kratos and Atreus meeting a giant sea serpent that could very well be J\u00f6rmungandr, one of Loki\u2019s three children and an instrumental player in the bringing about of Ragnar\u00f6k, Norse mythology\u2019s apocalyptic event. This bodes well for theories that Atreus is secretly an enemy of thunder god Thor, possibly the living embodiment of Ragnar\u00f6k. In other words, despite his new softer demeanor, Kratos might continue to serve as an antihero who\u2019s working against the protectors of the known universe as he did in the original trilogy. \n"}
