{"title": "Nintendo's Metal Slime-themed 2DS XL is unexpectedly classy", "content": " \nNintendo just announced its new clamshell 2DS XL, but there's already a special edition version announced for Japan. The New 2DS XL Dragon Quest Liquid Metal Edition \u2014 it's actually a 2DS \"LL\" in Japan, and the name is in Japanese, but this is a fair translation \u2014 will ship in a bundle with Dragon Quest XI in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the cute metallic Slime face poking out of there! He just wants to be your metal friend, while you farm him mercilessly for EXP.\nMy favorite limited edition 3DS so far was that $99 model Nintendo released last year for Black Friday, but I don't know this Metal Slime look is pretty great. It is a lot more expensive, though: it's priced at 22,480 yen (about $200), compared to the $149.99 for the standard New 2DS XL.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you're waiting for July to roll around so you can import this, don't forget to check out the actually-kind-of-great Dragon Quest Heroes II.\n"}
