{"title": "Internet providers are thrilled with the FCC\u2019s plan for weaker regulations", "content": " \nFCC chairman Ajit Pai announced today that he\u2019s proposing to do away with the regulatory classification his predecessor used to enact tough net neutrality rules.\nInstead of classifying internet providers as \u201ccommon carriers\u201d under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, they\u2019ll instead be classified as \u201cinformation services\u201d under Title I. That\u2019ll subject them to much more lenient oversight \u2014 and naturally, internet providers are happy to hear it.\nComcast, Verizon, AT&T, Charter, and Sprint all spoke out in support of the change after Pai announced it.\nInternet providers say they support net neutrality \u2014 they just hate Title II\nIn their statements, the companies all try to strike a balance between celebrating the rules rollback and declaring support for an open internet. But the system internet providers want seems to rely on trusting them to adhere by net neutrality guidance, rather than putting in enforceable lines that they\u2019re legally bound not to cross.\nIt\u2019s hard to see why internet providers would be celebrating right now if, as they claim, their support for net neutrality means nothing is going to change under this new regulatory regime. Clearly, this is opening up some new options for them.\nVerizon\u2019s deputy general counsel, Kathy Grillo, starts her note by saying that \u201cVerizon supports net neutrality,\u201d before going into the company\u2019s approval of the move away from Title II. \u201cIt undermines investment, reduces jobs, and stifles innovative new services,\u201d Grilllo writes. She also says that Title II hurts competition by preventing internet providers from experimenting with new practices.\nCharter CEO Tom Rutledge also opens his statement by noting that \u201cCharter\u2019s support for an open internet ... will never change.\u201d But he also called the reclassification proposal \u201ca welcome and necessary step\u201d that will \u201cspur investment.\u201d\nInternet providers say Title II hurts investment, but there\u2019s not much evidence of it\nComcast CEO Brian Roberts hits those same points, saying \u201cwe fully support reversal of Title II classification\u201d because it harms investment and innovation. He says Pai\u2019s proposal will start \u201ca fresh constructive dialogue\u201d on open internet protections.\n\u201cTo be clear, we continue to strongly support a free and open internet ... we don\u2019t block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content,\u201d says Roberts. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.)\nAT&T follows the same template. The company\u2019s CEO, Randall Stephenson, starts his statement by declaring AT&T\u2019s support for \u201cthe fundamental tenets of net neutrality.\u201d But he goes on to say that Title II was \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201cstifling.\u201d Switching to Title I, he says, will create \u201ca clearer path to invest more in our nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure.\u201d\nTo be very clear, there\u2019s not much evidence this is true. There was a dip in investment in 2015, when the current net neutrality rules were enacted, but the industry\u2019s own trade group called it \u201csmall\u201d and said oil prices may have been a factor \u2014 not just so-called regulatory uncertainty. And the investment numbers ticked up again the next year. Meanwhile, internet providers\u2019 stock prices are doing just fine, suggesting investors aren\u2019t actually worried.\n\u201cThe current FCC net neutrality rules are working.\u201d\nSprint released the only statement that didn\u2019t strongly attack Title II, though it did call out \u201cuncertainties\u201d caused by the current rules. (Those uncertainties being the fact that internet providers are suing to overturn them.) It added that \u201cSprint has always supported an open internet and will continue to do so,\u201d but said the company looked forward to the opportunity to \u201crefine the rules.\u201d\nT-Mobile didn\u2019t publish a statement or immediately get back to us for comment. But the CTIA, an industry group that represents it and other wireless carriers, put out a statement supporting the reversal of Title II, saying that it would lead to more investment, more jobs, and what CTIA CEO Meredith Attwell Baker calls \u201ccommon sense net neutrality rules.\u201d\nBut while internet providers are happy, companies that are based on the internet aren\u2019t.\nThe Internet Association, which represents three dozen or so web companies including Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Airbnb, Pinterest, Snapchat, Spotify, Dropbox, Twitter, Pandora, Etsy, eBay, PayPal, and Reddit, says that \u201crolling back these rules ... will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online.\u201d\n\u201cThe current FCC net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d says Michael Beckerman, CEO of the Internet Association. \u201cConsumers pay for access to the entire internet free from blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization.\u201d\nFacebook put out a statement of its own, saying \u201cWe support strong net neutrality rules and will continue to fight for rules that protect the open internet.\u201d Netflix, Spotify, and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment and pointed us to Internet Association's statement.\nWeb companies want net neutrality, but they aren\u2019t tied to Title II\nA huge group of startups and investors \u2014 more than 800 names total \u2014 organized in part by Y Combinator all signed a letter saying they\u2019re \u201cdeeply concerned with [Pai\u2019s] intention to undo the existing legal framework\u201d for net neutrality.\nThe interesting thing about these statements from startups and web companies is that they don\u2019t at all mention Title II. While these groups generally support the Title II classification, they aren\u2019t attached to it \u2014 what they\u2019re attached to is net neutrality, and they\u2019re often indifferent to the legal situation as long as the rules get implemented. That\u2019s not great news for Title II advocates, since big web companies are some of the loudest voices on their side in the fight for net neutrality. \nOne exception is video-sharing site Vimeo, which did specifically call out Title II in its statement deriding Pai\u2019s intention to repeal net neutrality regulations. \u201cThe plan unveiled today demonstrates Chairman Pai\u2019s disregard for startups and creators driving online innovation,\u201d the company writes. \u201cHis plan would undermine one of the core tenets of the Internet that makes innovation possible, create legal uncertainty, and ultimately reduce investment in both Internet services and broadband.\u201d\nVimeo says Pai\u2019s argument relies on a \u201cflawed notion\u201d of free market competition in the broadband space. \u201cRepealing Title II in favor of \u2018voluntary\u2019 commitments will enable this small and powerful group to continue inching closer to removing free choice on the Internet,\u201d the company concludes. \nStill, Vimeo aside, we aren\u2019t just looking at the debate over Title II again. Pai is also blowing open another question: what happens when you detach net neutrality from Title II? The first time the FCC tried that, the commission found out it wasn\u2019t possible.\nIs it possible for the commission to enact net neutrality protections under a lighter regulatory regime this time around? No one\u2019s really sure. And it doesn\u2019t sound like Pai is proposing an answer to that, either. Everyone claims to be in favor of their being some sort of rules \u2014 it\u2019s just not at all clear what they\u2019ll look like, or whether they\u2019ll have any teeth.\nUpdate April 26th, 6:26PM ET: Added comment from Vimeo. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nThe fight for net neutrality is officially back on\n\n\n"}
