{"title": "Show Notes: Senators making stupid internet analogies", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\n#IWD\n\nIt\u2019s both International Women\u2019s Day and the Day Without A Woman protest, and about half of The Verge\u2019s staff took the day to participate. So it was quiet around the office today. But our female staffers wrote a number of tremendous pieces about women in tech, science, culture, and transportation, and we were happy to feature them all day.\nHere\u2019s Kaitlyn Tiffany on the complicated relationship women in media have with strikes like this. It\u2019s just an excellent piece of reporting, with insight and observations from a variety of women in digital media taking a variety of approaches.\nLiz Lopatto, who runs our all-female science section, wrote about the reasons women drop out of STEM careers. Read this: it\u2019s the foundation for understanding why so many industries are disproportionately male. It\u2019s not because women aren\u2019t interested or successful in studying science and tech, but because they get forced out.\nNatt Garun wrote an enormously moving piece on her experiences with cancer and finding the support of other women on Facebook.\nTamara Warren wrote about the many, many women who\u2019ve pushed the transportation industry forward but haven\u2019t received the credit they deserve.\nLauren Goode noted that women in the tech industry weren\u2019t shocked by the explosive Uber allegations \u2014 because they\u2019ve long faced similar situations at workplaces throughout the tech industry.\nAnd Alessandra Potenza interviewed Sam Maggs, the author of Wonder Women, a book that profiles female pioneers in STEM. This is a fun read.\n\nWHAT THE HELL DOES THIS MEAN AJIT\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee today, where he heard the following nonsense metaphor from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson:\nLet's say a group of neighbors want to build a bridge over a creek so they can cross over and talk to each other a lot. So it's really for the neighborhood, maybe a dozen people. But then they find out the local government is going to require that [the] bridge is open to the entire community of a million people. No prioritization whatsoever. They don't get to cross first to see their neighbor. A million people can come onto their property, ruin their lawns, and walk over that bridge. Isn't that kind of a similar analogy? Isn't that a pretty good analogy in terms of what net neutrality is all about? ... Tell me where that analogy's maybe not accurate.\n\n\nLiterally none of this is accurate, Ron!\nFor starters, Verizon and Comcast and AT&T did not build \u201cbridges over creeks\u201d for their \u201cneighborhoods\u201d; they build massive broadband networks across the country, using enormous amounts of cash to secure wireless spectrum licenses and municipal permits to lay fiber.\nWireless spectrum, in particular, is a scarce public resource that the government controls because otherwise nothing would work. Unlicensed bands, like 2.4GHz, are great and allow things like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to proliferate, but um, radio interference from other 2.4GHz devices is why Nintendo is having problems with Switch controllers. You don\u2019t want that to happen with every band, especially ones that support things like LTE.\nAnd it\u2019s not like anyone wants hundreds of companies investing in digging up roads to lay fiber.\nSo the premise of Johnson\u2019s analogy is insanely wrong from the jump. But where he goes from there is equally ridiculous: the idea that net neutrality is the equivalent of \u201cthe local government\u201d requiring that \u201ca million people can come onto their property, ruin their lawns, and walk over that bridge.\u201d\nCasting Comcast as a little old lady whose rosebushes are getting trampled by open internet traffic requires an almost breathtaking amount of self-deception.\nAdditionally, the value of the internet is derived from millions of people gaining the ability to send and receive information freely. Entire companies have generated billions in value because of open network access. Prominent examples that Ron Johnson may have heard of include two little outfits called Google and Facebook. The internet does not exist so AT&T can \u201ccross first to see their neighbor.\u201d Come on.\nHow did Ajit Pai respond to this insanely inaccurate metaphor designed to make huge ISPs seem like innocent townspeople crushed under the weight of tyrannical government? \u201cSenator, you\u2019ve put your finger on one of the core concerns.\u201d\nSigh. Sigh.\n\nChairman Pai (and hell, Ron Johnson, who represents my home state of Wisconsin) are welcome on The Vergecast at any time to discuss these issues.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\n\nPinterest acquired Jelly, which is such a nonsense leftover phrase from the halycon days of the tech bubble. Read Casey Newton demolish what\u2019s left of this world.\nGoogle\u2019s having a big ol\u2019 cloud computing conference this week, and today the company announced that it can now recognize objects in videos using machine vision. Awesome. Terrifying. Awesomely terrifying.\nMore AI news: Facebook announced that its new AI training servers are now twice as fast. Because we all want Facebook to scan our personal data twice as fast as before.\nEven more AI news! China\u2019s Didi Chuxing announced that it\u2019s building an R&D center in Silicon Valley, focused on AI and self-driving. Didi, if you\u2019ll recall, just kicked Uber\u2019s ass in China and took a billion-dollar investment from Apple. The new research center will include employees like Charlie Miller, who famously hacked a Jeep remotely in 2015 and who... Didi poached from Uber.\nThe war for tech talent around cars is hotter than ever, and the knives are out for Uber. This is going to be interesting.\nNest rumors? Sure, Nest rumors: the company is reportedly working on cheaper thermostats and a home security system. Which makes sense, if only because Nest should be working on literally anything new.\nFinally, Nintendo says the Switch will get Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon video apps \u201cin time.\u201d Which should terrify every other tablet maker, because a $299 tablet that can play AAA games and watch Netflix is more useful than virtually every Android tablet and most of the ancient iPads still lying around people\u2019s homes.\n\n\n"}
