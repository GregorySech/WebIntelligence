{"title": "Coach's $150 dinosaur Apple Watch strap now comes in fall colors", "content": " \nCoach is a fashion brand that has been making Apple Watch bands since June 2016, which the company has periodically refreshed with new styles, colors, and designs. Given that the fall season is fast approaching, it\u2019s only logical that Coach would update its offerings with new fall colors to match your fall ensemble (assuming you\u2019re the kind of person who buys seasonal watch bands, anyway.) Haute \u00c9criture has the full rundown on what exactly is new in Coach\u2019s lineup, if you\u2019re interested in the complete lineup. \nObjectively the best Apple Watch band, full stop\nBut we\u2019re not really here to talk about that. We\u2019re here to talk about the new Goldenrod color for the Rexy strap, which stands out from Coach\u2019s other $150 Apple Watch bands by the simple virtue of having a colorful cartoon dinosaur on it. Coach has offered the strap for a while already, but the new color is a perfect opportunity to remind the world that it a. exists and b. is objectively the best Apple Watch band, full stop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I can hear you objecting: \u201cChaim, doesn\u2019t an Apple Watch start at $269? Isn\u2019t it a waste of money to spend more than half the value of the watch itself on a band?\u201d It\u2019s a valid complaint, to which I will reply that if you can\u2019t see the value of a $150 dinosaur strap, you clearly lack any knowledge of modern fashion, aesthetics, or what is truly great in life.  \nThe Goldenrod Rexy Apple Watch strap is available now from Coach.  \n"}
