{"title": "NBC uncanceled Timeless, thanks to pressure from fans", "content": " \nThis week marks the 2017 television upfronts, in which networks reveal next season\u2019s programming for advertisers. To get ready for the new group of shows, lower-rated programs have been getting the ax. One such show was NBC\u2019s time travel show Timeless, which was canceled last week. However, the network took an unusual step by reversing that decision on Saturday, thanks in part to outcry from the show\u2019s fans.  \nTimeless follows a history professor, a soldier, and an engineer as they\u2019re tasked with tracking down a stolen time machine, and discover that there\u2019s plans underway to attempt to change the past. Created by Shawn Ryan (The Shield, Last Resort) and Eric Kripke (Supernatural, Revolution), the show was generally well received and garnered a dedicated fanbase, but saw its ratings fall over the course of its first season. While the show came in on top in an influential USA Today poll that asked viewers which \u201cbubble\u201d show they wanted to see return, it ended up on the chopping block last week. \nIt is the outcry of fans that helped NBC change course\nAccording to NBC executives, it was the outcry from the fans that prompted them to change their minds on Saturday morning. \u201cWe heard from fans and the outcry and we woke up the next morning and thought, \u2018Let\u2019s figure out how to bring it back,'\u201d NBC Chairman Robert Greenblatt said during a phone conference with reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe went back to the drawing board in every way.\u201d The result is a second, 10-episode season that will air sometime in 2018.\n\n\nI hear something strange.

The show\u2019s cast and crew were elated. Show star Abigail Spencer tweeted her appreciation to fans for their efforts in the reversal, while Kripke joked that they went back in time to change the decision.\nScience fiction television is littered with hundreds of shows that have been prematurely canceled. While fan campaigns helped to resurrect shows such as Star Trek, Firefly, and Farscape in various ways, most stories simply come to an end, remembered only when they appear on a streaming service. With Timeless, fans were able to hold off that fate a bit longer. \n\n"}
