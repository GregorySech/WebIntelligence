{"title": "XX is a rambunctious horror anthology made by four promising female directors", "content": " \nWhen director Jovanka Vuckovic introduced XX at its Sundance premiere, she made the origins of the project clear. A horror anthology that brings together installments from four female directors, Vuckovic said it was created \u201cdirectly in response to the lack of opportunity for women filmmakers, particularly in the horror genre.\u201d Horror, of course, is a genre that\u2019s often touted as an easy first step for upcoming filmmakers, but sexism runs deep within the film industry, and for the producers of XX, one of the best ways to combat that was to simply create more opportunities for women in the first place.\nThe finished film combines shorts from Vuckovic, Roxanne Benjamin, Karyn Kusama (The Invitation), and Anne Clark (better known as St. Vincent), all bound together by imaginative wraparound sequences by animator Sofia Carrillo. It\u2019s at turns terrifying, hilarious, and uneven, but succeeds in doing its most important job: showing off a range of distinct directorial voices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSundance Film Festival 2017\nRead the latest reviews, interviews, and news from the annual film fest at Park City.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\n\nIt\u2019s a horror anthology, but inside that you\u2019ve got a black comedy, a more traditional monster flick, and even a Satanic psychological drama.\n\nWhat\u2019s it about?\n\nJovanka Vuckovic\u2019s \u201cThe Box\u201d is about a family that is slowly picked apart after a stranger on the subway shows their youngest son something mysterious he\u2019s hiding in a big red box. Suddenly the boy won\u2019t eat, and won\u2019t explain why. Then he tells his sister what he saw, and she won\u2019t eat. As the two children start to waste away, the boy then talks to his father... Based on the Jack Ketchum short story, \u201cThe Box\u201d is the most straightforward short in the batch, and uses some disturbing visual effects to portray the young children as they literally starve to death.\nIt\u2019s followed by \u201cThe Birthday Party,\u201d a black comedy directed by musician Annie Clark. Melanie Lynskey plays a suburban housewife that is simply desperate to throw her daughter the most wonderful birthday party she can imagine. Her personal idiosyncrasies aside, everything seems to be going well, until she discovers her husband has committed suicide. But a party is a party, and the show must go on.\nRoxanne Benjamin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Fall\u201d is a traditional cabin-in-the-woods style thriller. A group of friends head out to a remote location to camp where they notice some ancient markings on a rock outcropping. Later that night, an ancient force takes control of one of their own, and comes after the group in a exhilarating display of visual audacity and perfectly timed scares.\nKaryn Kusama wraps the anthology up with \u201cHer Only Living Son.\u201d The short is centered around a single mom whose son is turning 18 and has been demonstrating some disturbing and violent tendencies. It turns out that the boy\u2019s father isn\u2019t exactly who the mother has always said he was, and now he is coming back to collect on a debt he\u2019s owed. \n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nGiven that this is an anthology of shorts, there\u2019s not the thematic continuity you would get in a normal feature. (Few of the filmmakers traded notes beforehand, and the only unifying directive was that each entry needed to be directed by a woman and feature a female lead.) But the shorts do give their own unique spins to what could be considered traditional story types. \u201cThe Box\u201d tracks the horror of the children slowly dying, but its emotional thrust is with the mother, as she sees her perfect life spiral away without any control. Clark is exploring familiar comedy of errors territory, but it\u2019s the pressure on suburban woman to conform and fit into a perfectly manicured life that she\u2019s lampooning, with hilarious results. The dudebros of \u201cDon\u2019t Fall\u201d are utterly unprepared for the ancient evil that descends upon them. And Kusama takes setups that have been explored in countless occult films before, but explores them through to their logical, human conclusion, asking how a mother would actually react when faced with such horrors.\nIt\u2019s a good example of why Hollywood as an industry needs more diverse and representative filmmakers behind the camera. These directors are offering their own twists and takes, providing insights that haven\u2019t been explored yet. It\u2019s worth saying that diversity and representation aren\u2019t just optics problems, even though that\u2019s how they\u2019re often treated by organizations like the Academy Awards. They\u2019re vital to the health and growth of any art form, and projects like XX demonstrate that creative urgency.\n\nBut is it any good?\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of fun! Like nearly all anthology films, some entries are better than others. My personal favorites were \u201cThe Birthday Party,\u201d thanks to its wonderful irreverence and pitch-black sense of humor, and \u201cDon\u2019t Fall,\u201d which on a sheer execution level is a rocket-fueled nightmare trip full of images I\u2019m still thinking about. But even if some segments don\u2019t play as well as others, they each have interesting things to say, and the beauty of an anthology is that there\u2019s always another entry just around the corner if one chapter isn\u2019t working for you.\n\nWhat should it be rated?\n\nThis one is pretty easy. Rated \u201cR\u201d for murdering demons, screaming children, dying children, and squirrel cruelty. \n\nHow can I actually watch it?\n\nXX hits theaters February 17th, but it\u2019s also hitting iTunes, Amazon, and streaming services at the same time. \n\nThis review originally appeared on January 24, 2017, in conjunction with the film's screenings at the Sundance Film Festival. It has been republished to coincide with the film's theatrical and streaming release.\n"}
