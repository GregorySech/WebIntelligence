{"title": "The crucial thing the new Wonder Woman movie gets right about the character\u2019s history", "content": " \nLike most based-on-a-true-story biographical films, Angela Robinson\u2019s Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is only loosely connected to actual events. Psychology professor William Moulton Marston (played by Luke Evans in the film) did create the comic book character Wonder Woman, and he did live in a polyamorous relationship with his wife Elizabeth Marston (Rebecca Hall) and their grad student Olive Byrne (Bella Heathcote). Everything else in the movie, though, is up for grabs. \nRobinson frames her film around the explicit war against Marston\u2019s life and work. But in spite of complaints about the bondage in the Wonder Woman comics, Marston was never seriously threatened with being fired from the title he created. The comics sold too well, and he was too skilled at defending his work. In spite of the sultry lie detector scenes in the film, the lie detector Marston created never worked, and certainly wasn\u2019t instrumental in getting William, Elizabeth, and Olive to declare their feelings for each other. So far as anyone knows, no neighbor ever wandered into the Marston household and found Marston, Elizabeth, and Olive having kinky costumed sex. William and Elizabeth didn\u2019t subsequently split up with Olive, even temporarily. And as the photos over the closing credits prove, Elizabeth, Olive, and William did not look anything like glamorous movie stars. \n\nBut the movie depicts one important thing accurately: Elizabeth and Olive were bisexual. They didn\u2019t just have separate sexual relationships with William. They had a sexual relationship with each other. \nThis doesn\u2019t seem like it should be a controversial point. As the film notes, Elizabeth and Olive named their children after each other. After William died in 1947, the two women lived together for almost 40 years. \nAnd there\u2019s substantial evidence that the Marstons were aware of lesbian relationships and approved of them. Marston wrote extensively about female-on-female attraction in his scholarly work, going so far as to discuss the mechanics of tribadism and female oral sex. He presented lesbian sex as normal and healthy, and even suggested that half of all women were lesbians. Olive helped him research sorority initiation rituals; they concluded that the rituals were sites of intense same-sex eroticism. In one passage in his academic work, Marston describes two women making love in front of him. It isn\u2019t difficult to figure out who those women were. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration: DC Comics\n\n\nThe daring whimsy, frank sexuality, and space kangaroos of the original Wonder Woman comics\n\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t even getting into Marston\u2019s erotic novel about Julius Caesar in which he describes lesbianism as \u201cperfect,\u201d nor the Wonder Woman comics, in which women tie each other up, spank each other, and dress up as deer in order to mime eating one another. Marston was an enthusiastic lesbophiliac who lived with two women in a polyamorous relationship. People have to be really committed to not seeing the obvious to not see the obvious. Yet, despite all of this, scholars and fans have still been remarkably reluctant to acknowledge that Elizabeth and Olive were lovers.\nThe Marston family\u2019s polyamory was probably first discussed publicly by Les Daniels in his Complete History of Wonder Woman in 2004. Daniels acknowledged that Marston had children with both Elizabeth and Olive, but did not discuss Elizabeth and Olive\u2019s relationship. That elision has continued, to some extent, to the present day. Jill Lepore\u2019s recent wildly popular Marston biography, The Secret History of Wonder Woman, includes accounts of naked feminist New Age sex parties, but is oddly coy about acknowledging Elizabeth and Olive\u2019s bisexuality. At times, Lepore broadly hints, as when she points out that Elizabeth was a lifelong fan of Sappho\u2019s poetry. And then at other times, Lepore seems to deny the lesbian relationship, as when she includes a (poorly sourced) anecdote suggesting that William threatened to leave Elizabeth if she didn\u2019t accept Olive into their marriage.\nWhy have people been so reticent about acknowledging that Elizabeth and Olive were lovers, when Elizabeth and Olive were obviously lovers? In 1990\u2019s The Epistemology of the Close, Eve Sedgwick argues that the refusal to admit that figures in the past were gay is part of the way the dominant culture represses and denies homosexuality. Sedgwick says scholarship and history respond to gay people in the past by commanding, \u201cDon\u2019t ask. Or, less laconically: You shouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Because of stigma, queer people had to hide \u2014 and then historians use their lack of clear visibility as false proof that they didn\u2019t exist. Heterosexuality is the assumed default. Sedgwick notes drily that without ironclad proof \u201csuch as sperm taken from the body of another man or a nude photograph with another woman\u2026 the author may be assumed to have been ardently and exclusively heterosexual.\u201d Even two women living together for four decades, with evidence that they shared the same bed, isn\u2019t enough to say for sure.\nThe assumption behind this sort of high barrier to belief is that there\u2019s something shameful about same-sex attraction. In the case of the Marstons, bisexuality is somehow even more verboten than polyamory. That attitude isn\u2019t just homophobic, it\u2019s also a betrayal of Marston\u2019s entire life\u2019s work. In his scholarly writing and his comics, Marston insistently, deliberately portrayed lesbianism as normal and good. He encouraged children to see diverse erotic possibilities as fun, enjoyable, and exciting, not shameful or dangerous. And he insisted that women were powerful, loving, and in control of their own desires. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claire Folger / Annapurna Pictures\n\n\n\u201cOlive and Elizabeth were kind of hidden by history. I thought that was very much a reflection of their times.\u201d \u2014Director Angela Robinson discusses what she intended with Professor Marston\n\n\n\nIf Olive and Elizabeth weren\u2019t lovers, the Wonder Woman comics turn into some weird stifled fantasy, a vision of eroticized lesbian love which existed only in Marston\u2019s fantasies. But it seems much clearer that the early comics\u2019 playful eroticism was meant as a love letter to the woman Marston cared about. It was an effort to imagine, and to bring about, a world in which they wouldn\u2019t have to hide.\nProfessor Marston and the Wonder Women is really more about Elizabeth and Olive\u2019s love than it is about Marston, and that\u2019s a choice Marston himself would have strongly approved of. We don\u2019t know that Marston lost his job because of his polyamory, as the movie claims, nor is there evidence that the family\u2019s neighbors shunned them. But the fact that Elizabeth and Olive\u2019s relationship has been denied for so long suggests the effect homophobia and the need for secrecy had on their lives. Director Angela Robinson, a lesbian herself, opens the closet door, and presents the love of William, Olive, and Elizabeth, not as shameful, but as courageous and beautiful. Inevitably, the film gets a lot wrong, but it does get that much right.\nNoah Berlatsky is the author of Wonder Woman: Bondage and Feminism in the Marston/Peter Comics.\n"}
