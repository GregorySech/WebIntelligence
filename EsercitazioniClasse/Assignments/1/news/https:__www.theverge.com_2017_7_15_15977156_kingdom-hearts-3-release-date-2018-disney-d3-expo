{"title": "Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out in 2018", "content": " \nKingdom Hearts 3, the long awaited third major installment in the epic Final Fantasy and Disney crossover RPG series, finally has a release date, although it remains somewhat ambiguous for now. At the conclusion of a new Toy Story-themed trailer of the game shown off at Disney\u2019s D23 expo today, developer Square Enix revealed that the game would indeed be coming out in 2018. Even better news: from the footage shown off of Sora and pals Donald and Goofy teaming up with Woody and Buzz Lightyear, the game looks fantastic, with an even deeper and zanier battle system and ultra-polished visuals. \nThe news should overjoy Kingdom Hearts fans would\u2019ve waited nearly 13 years for a sequel to the second major game in the series. It should also assuage the fears of those dreading the worst: that the game would simply never make it out of development hell, or in a worst case scenario get canned for good. But Square Enix \u2014 which wrapped up long and tortuous development cycle for Final Fantasy XV, its other highly anticipated RPG \u2014 appears better equipped to get its most anticipated titles out the door at last. \n"}
