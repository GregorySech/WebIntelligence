{"title": "Undocumented tech workers brace for Trump\u2019s next move", "content": " \nDiane arrived in the US when she was just a child, moving from Mexico through the South, before finally settling in the Northeast. As she got older, she came to appreciate the anonymity of a big city. Public transit made it easier to live without a driver\u2019s license, a necessary result of life without a local birth certificate or social security card. That kind of bureaucratic tangle was a greater concern than immigration agents, who rarely turned an eye toward her neighborhood.\nAs she reached the end of high school, the tangle became more serious. She had done well in high school, but applying to college meant more forms and more questions about her background. She couldn\u2019t use her school\u2019s admissions resources or apply for most scholarships, but found her way to a school across the country. She did well at college, too, and is now part of the community around Code2040, a San Francisco-based organization promoting diversity in tech.\nIt\u2019s a common story, so common that there\u2019s a name for it. Diane is a Dreamer, to use the language of Congress\u2019 troubled immigration bill \u2014 a young, US-educated immigrant who came to the country as a minor. Over the past eight years, President Obama and Congress cycled through a number of attempts to help Diane and others like her, first with the now-shelved DREAM Act, and then with an executive order called Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, or DACA. Issued by President Obama, the order allowed for work permits and other protections for anyone who entered the country before the age of 16, provided they had no felony convictions and met other conditions. Still in place, it currently protects nearly 750,000 people from deportation. \nIf Trump repeals DACA, Diane may have to leave the country where she\u2019s lived almost all her life\nJust weeks after taking office, the Trump administration is already exploring ways to undo that order, and subject Diane and others like her to deportation. Trump campaigned on reversing President Obama\u2019s immigration orders, referring to DACA as an \u201cillegal executive amnesty\u201d during the campaign. A draft executive order leaked in January would end the program outright, honoring work permits like the one held by Diane, but declining to renew them, eventually exposing all permit-holders to deportation. At the same time, the new president has stepped up raids on undocumented immigrants already in the country, with more than 680 people captured for deportation last week. If Trump follows through on his plan for DACA, Diane may have to leave the country where she\u2019s lived almost all her life.\nIt\u2019s a struggle that could have a profound effect on the tech industry. The sector owes a unique debt to immigrants \u2014 the current CEOs of Google and Microsoft are both foreign-born, along with over a third of Silicon Valley\u2019s population. It\u2019s hard to be sure how many undocumented immigrants are currently working in tech, although both immigrant surveys and tech diversity numbers suggest the figure is low. Still, anecdotal reports show those workers do exist, and in the wake of Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration moves, their position has become more precarious than ever.\n\u201cThey fear for themselves and their families.\u201d\nFor now, tech workers benefitting from DACA may be keeping a low profile. \u201cAlmost all of the people that work with DACA in tech are not outspoken because they fear for themselves and their families,\u201d says Laura Gomez, an early YouTube and Twitter employee who now works with diversity and immigration groups including FWD.us. She mentors a number of college students who worry that their work permits, approved under DACA, will now be used to target them and their families in future immigration raids.\n\u201cThey feel like their future is at stake now,\u201d Gomez says.\nThose students are part of the group that organizations like Code2040 have been working to bring into the tech industry. Each year, Code2040\u2019s fellows program shepherds a few dozen black and latino computer science students through a rigorous summer internship, giving them career guidance and a foot in the door at some of the industry\u2019s biggest companies. The program has graduated hundreds of students over the past five years, with support from Google, Andreessen Horowitz, and other top firms. Code2040 doesn\u2019t know how many of those students are undocumented \u2014 retaining the data would make the organization vulnerable to a subpoena \u2014 but its executives have long understood that many of them may be facing the same troubles as Diane. After the inauguration in January, the organization\u2019s directors sent a letter to the community at large, promising to continue to accept students regardless of their immigration status.\nVice president of programs Karla Monterroso says those students are at the core of the company\u2019s mission, and deporting them would be massively destructive. \u201cYou can have a kid who grew up here, was educated here, worked miracles to get scholarship money to get themselves through college, and now cannot apply that education at a job that America is desperately in need of,\u201d says Monterroso.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told I should be deported or exterminated.\u201d\nBeyond specific restrictions, diversity groups must also fight a broader sense that immigrants aren\u2019t as welcome in Trump\u2019s America. For Code2040, that\u2019s largely translated to online harassment. A number of the group\u2019s leaders have been targeted by white nationalists on Twitter, often after major press hits or funding announcements. That harassment began during the campaign, but has only intensified since the inauguration. \u201cAs a Latina, I\u2019ve been told I should be deported or exterminated or that I\u2019m leading the white genocide,\u201d says Monterroso. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. I think for us, the question is how do you understand how much pain people are in, and how that pain is being directed in really toxic ways.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Diane is bracing for whatever comes next. For now, she plans to stay through the end of her DACA-enabled work permit, which lasts for the next two years. After that, she\u2019ll face a hard decision: overstay her work permit, or leave her home with no clear prospects for coming back.\n\u201cMaybe I just thought that this country was better or different,\u201d she says. \u201cI put it on a pedestal. I thought that no matter how much pain it brought me, it was still the best option to stay here rather than go somewhere else. And I\u2019m starting to realize that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\u201cMy community is here, all the friends that I grew up with, my sister, my dad, they\u2019re all here,\u201d Diane says. \u201cAm I going to leave this country? Is this country even a place that is home for me?\u201d\nNote: The Verge agreed to withhold Diane\u2019s real name and precise affiliation with Code2040 out of concern for immigration action against her.\n"}
