{"title": "Netflix CEO says he isn\u2019t worried that Trump administration will gut net neutrality", "content": " \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings says he\u2019s \u201cnot too worried\u201d about what will happen if new FCC chairman Ajit Pai eliminates the Title II regulations that have guaranteed a neutral internet experience for US consumers in recent years. \nSpeaking to a group of journalists at Netflix\u2019s headquarters in Los Gatos, California, earlier today, Hastings said he believes \u201cthe culture around net neutrality is very strong. The expectations of consumers are very strong. So even if the formal framework gets weakened,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe don\u2019t see a big risk actualizing, because consumers know they\u2019re entitled to getting all of the web services.\u201d \n\u201cConsumers know they\u2019re entitled to getting all of the web services.\"\nHastings was responding to questions The Verge asked during the briefing, and stressed that Netflix is only participating in so-called zero-rating schemes with wireless carriers because \u201cthey\u2019re not choosing one over the other .... they\u2019re providing consumers with a better value without being a gateway.\u201d \nNet neutrality has been a hot-button topic in the US since new president Donald Trump chose Pai as the new chairman of the FCC. Pai is a well-known opponent of the FCC establishing net neutrality rules, which exist to prevent internet service providers from prioritizing certain content, and which officially went into effect under the Obama administration in 2015. Since Pai\u2019s appointment, there have been many questions around how the rules might change, and whether the overarching principle of internet neutrality could be compromised. \nIn the past, Hastings has been outspoken about practices he believed went against net neutrality principles, calling out Comcast on his Facebook page back in 2012 and again in 2014 (in a company blog post that now appears to redirect back to the main page of the Netflix blog). \nThen in 2015, Netflix announced a deal with Australian ISP iiNet to exempt its traffic from data caps, and last year said it would work with US carrier T-Mobile on its Binge On program, which lets customers stream video from Netflix and HBO without it racking up monthly data usage. Some net neutrality activists saw this as a reversal in Netflix\u2019s earlier position. \nNetflix doesn\u2019t see T-Mobile\u2019s program as a conflict because it\u2019s open to all video providers\nHastings said he doesn\u2019t see programs like Binge On as a conflict because \u201cT-Mobile in the US is making it open to all video providers ... and so the key thing is that it\u2019s neutral, and any video provider, our competitors or us, can sign up. There\u2019s no fees. The key thing that T-Mobile requires is that you stream at a lower bit rate, about one megabyte, and that saves them a lot at the network bandwidth.\u201d \nHe went on to say that programs like this are a positive because \u201cyou see how competitive the market is. They\u2019ve been gaining market share in the US, and now you\u2019ve gotten responses from AT&T and others increasing unlimited [data]. We\u2019re big fans of these programs that are neutral, and free to customers.\u201d \nHastings\u2019 analysis of programs like Binge On as neutral is, of course, not entirely unmotivated. As the key player in internet video, his company already has partnerships set up to ensure that he\u2019s in any conversations about zero-rating video services \u2014 something a brand-new video startup won\u2019t have.\n"}
