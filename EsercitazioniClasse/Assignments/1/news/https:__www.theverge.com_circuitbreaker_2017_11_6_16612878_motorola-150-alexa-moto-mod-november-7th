{"title": "Motorola\u2019s $150 Alexa Moto Mod is available for preorder on November 7th", "content": " \nMotorola\u2019s Alexa speaker Moto Mod for its Moto Z phones \u2014 officially known as the Moto Smart Speaker with Amazon Alexa \u2014 will be available for preorders starting on November 7th for $149.99. The attachment will be available a week later on BestBuy.com and Motorola.com, starting November 13th, and will come to Verizon a few days after that on the 16th.\nAs noted when Motorola first announced the Moto Smart Speaker with Amazon Alexa, it\u2019s worth remembering that you can just buy an actual Amazon Echo for $99 (or a $129 Echo Spot, or a $149 Echo Plus), and get a device with better microphones, a larger speaker, and compatibility with more than just a handful of Motorola phones. \nBut hey, it\u2019s your call. \n"}
