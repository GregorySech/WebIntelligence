{"title": "Uber extends investigation into its toxic workplace because there\u2019s so much evidence", "content": " \nThe team investigating Uber\u2019s toxic workplace and culture must have found a lot of evidence, because they just asked the company\u2019s board of directors for an additional month to sift through everything before submitting their findings.\nIn February, Uber announced that former US Attorney General Eric Holder and his colleague Tammy Albarr\u00e1n would conduct a review of the ride-hail company\u2019s corporate culture, following allegations of rampant sexism and harassment. Holder and Albarr\u00e1n have been reporting on a weekly basis to a subcommittee of Uber\u2019s board of directors, consisting of Arianna Huffington, Bill Gurley, and David Bonderman. \n\u201cTo ensure that no stone is left unturned...\u201d\n\u201cWhen Eric Holder and Tammy Albarr\u00e1n began their review, we told them that they would have all the support and time necessary to conduct an intensive, thorough review of Uber\u2019s workplace and culture,\u201d the board members said in a statement. \u201cEric and Tammy have asked us for more time to complete their assessment, which includes information received from hundreds of employees through interviews and anonymous online focus groups and reflects the global scale of the company\u2019s operations. To ensure that no stone is left unturned, we have granted that request and anticipate a report by the end of May.\u201d The statement mirrors an internal email that Recode reported last night.\nAt the time, the news drew criticism because of Holder\u2019s ties to the company. Uber retains his law firm, Covington & Burling, for advice on safety issues. Holder even advocated for Uber last summer by sending letters to officials to drop policies mandating fingerprint-based background checks for drivers. Holder\u2019s former chief of staff and Covington employee, Margaret Richardson, also sits on Uber\u2019s safety advisory board. Early Uber investors Mitch and Freada Kapor Klein called the move \u201cdisappointing.\u201d \nThe first hint of Uber\u2019s troubles surfaced in February, when a former engineer named Susan Fowler published a blog post about her work experience with rampant sexism and the failures of Uber\u2019s managers to solve the issue at every turn. Her account went viral and resulted in widespread outrage.\nSince then, it\u2019s been scandal after scandal at Uber, from high-level executives running for the exit to revelations about legally questionable practices. Every time Uber\u2019s employees thought they were climbing out of the hole they were in, a new controversy would surface and the hole would get deeper. It\u2019s gotten to a point when some observers may read headlines like this and briefly assume they\u2019re real. \n\n\nUber Has Apologized In Advance If Anyone Finds Out About Something Called \u2018Project Judas\u2019 https://t.co/BcYsKwzbKt\u2014 ClickHole (@ClickHole) April 18, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
