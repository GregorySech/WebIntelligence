{"title": "For $2,185, you can travel Game of Thrones\u2019 Seven Kingdoms", "content": " \nHBO\u2019s hit Game of Thrones is mainly shot in Europe, around world heritage sites, major tourist attractions, and small towns. That sounds like a European PR travel company\u2019s fever dream. Travel comparison site liligo.com has assembled an itinerary for fans of the show to fly to sites from all seven kingdoms of Westeros (Calgary, where showrunners shot some minor scenes with dire wolves; and Los Angeles, the site of the season 3 scene with Brienne and the bear, were excluded from the itinerary). The whole trip will take three days and nine hours in the air, excluding day-trip car rides to get to more obscure filming locations. Local lodging isn\u2019t included, just travel costs, which come to about $2,185, assuming people nab tickets in August. (Prices fluctuate depending on the season.)\nAlthough there\u2019s no organized tour of all of the countries \u2014 Liligo\u2019s calculations are based on a la carte shopping for flights and bookings \u2014 many of these locations have recognized the financial opportunity and set up local Game of Thrones-related tours.\nMinor spoilers for Game of Thrones seasons 1\u20136 ahead.\nAssuming you start off in New York (sorry, non-New Yorkers), flying to Barcelona, will cost $366 and take 7.5 hours. It will cost another $80 in bus fares to see three different Spanish cities, and varying dollar amounts in car rentals to reach smaller towns including C\u00e1ceres\u200e, which is a five-hour car ride. On the list: Seville, where Dorne scenes were shot, and the Bardenas Reales and Spanish Badlands, which make up the Dothraki sea. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlc\u00e1zar of Sevilla as the water gardens of Dorne.\nPhoto: liligo.com\n\n\nThe next step involves flying to Morocco for $86, to see the fictional Slaver\u2019s Bay cities that Daenerys freed, including Astapor, Pentos, and Yunkai. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssaouira as Astapor and King\u2019s Landing.\nPhoto: liligo.com\n\n\nFrom Morocco, getting to Malta costs $380. Much of season 1 was filmed there, and it stands in for some parts of King\u2019s Landing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure Window as Gozo, the venue for Daenerys and Drogo\u2019s wedding in Season 1.\nPhoto: lilago.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzure Window as Gozo, the venue for Daenerys and Drogo\u2019s wedding in season 1.\nPhoto: lilago.com\n\n\nHopping from Malta to southern Croatia, another country featured in several King\u2019s Landing landscapes, will cost $148, and a flight from there to the Split peninsula is another $209. There, you can see the Church of Saint Ignatius, where Cersei\u2019s walk of shame from season 6 was shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDubrovnik as King\u2019s Landing.\nPhoto: liligo.com\n\n\nGetting back to where most of Game of Thrones actors hail from, you can fly from Croatia to Edinburgh, Scotland for $235 to see parts of Winterfell. A much shorter flight to Belfast, Ireland costs $45, and you can see much of Westeros here, including the King\u2019s Road and House Greyjoy\u2019s castle ruins.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Hedges as Kingsroad.\nPhoto: liligo.com\n\n\nLastly, visit Reykjavik, Iceland for $182 to see the lands beyond the Wall, including one magical cave, where Jon enjoyed a tryst with Ygritte. (See the top image.) From Iceland, you can return back to New York for $250.\n"}
