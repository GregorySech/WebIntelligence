{"title": "RIP John Mollo, who created the iconic costumes of Star Wars", "content": " \nWhen Star Wars hit theaters in 1977, it was unlike any film that audiences had seen, presenting a worn, lived-in feel world for its story. That visual aesthetic was due in part to John Mollo, the film\u2019s costume designer who went on to earn an Academy Award for his work on the film. According to The Times of London, Mollo passed away earlier this week at the age of 86. \nBorn in 1931, Mollo was a military historian who authored several books on military uniforms, and eventually found work as a consultant on films such as The Charge of the Light Brigade and Barry Lyndon. When George Lucas began work on Star Wars in 1976, he approached Milena Canonero, who designed the costumes for Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange. However, she was already working on another project, but recommended her assistant on Barry Lyndon, John Mollo. \u201cI met with him and he seemed very good,\u201d Lucas recalled in The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film, \u201cI wanted somebody that really knew armor, somebody who was more into military hardware rather than somebody who knew how to design for the stage. I wanted designs that wouldn\u2019t stand out, which would blend in and look like they belonged there.\u201d\nMollo joined the project as the film\u2019s costume designer and set about adapting Ralph McQuarrie\u2019s iconic concept images into wearable costumes for the film\u2019s characters, stormtroopers, and aliens. \u201cFor Darth Vader, we put on a black motorcycle suit, a Nazi helmet, a gas mask, and a monk\u2019s cloak we found in the Middle Ages department,\u201d he recalled in The Making of Star Wars. \u201cWe did very little drawing; it was more of a practical make-do amend, because there was already an established style.\u201d Mollo worked closely with set designer John Barry, and together, they helped form the run-down look for the world that Lucas envisioned. \nMollo had a budget of $90,000 for the costumes for Star Wars \nHe did so with very little. According to Chris Taylor in How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise, he had a meager budget of just $90,000 \u2014 less than the cost of any of the individual sets. He and his crew worked at a quick pace. \u201cI think we had something like four days before shooting,\u201d he said, about assembling the film\u2019s stormtroopers. \u201cWe just played around until we managed to string it all together in such a way that you could get the armor on and off in an actor in about five minutes.\u201d \nLater, when Lucas decided to use a handful of troopers on location in Tunisia, Mollo improvised new equipment for the soldiers. \u201cI went into this Boy Scout shop in London and bought one of these metal backpack racks. they we took plastic seed boxes, stuck two of those together, and put four of those on the rack. Then we put plastic drainpipe on the top, with a laboratory pipe on the side, and everything was sprayed black.\u201d \nHe was also responsible for the plethora of aliens present in the film\u2019s iconic Mos Eisley Cantina, and when Lucas began shooting the film\u2019s final scene with hundreds of extras, Mollo found that the scene wasn\u2019t in their budget. \u201cWe really had to make do. Nothing was made at all; it was all stock items.\u201d Mollo and his team scrounged for military uniforms and hats to outfit them all before the cameras began rolling. \nTheir efforts paid off: Mollo earned an Academy Award for his work on the film. \u201cAs you see,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech, surrounded by Darth Vader and a group of Stormtroopers, \u201cthe costumes of Star Wars are not so much costumes, as bits of plumbing and automobile engineering.\u201d \nAfter Star Wars, Mollo went on to work on other science fiction films, including Alien,  The Empire Strikes Back, and Outland, where he once again created their distinctive, lived-in worlds. He continued to work in the film and television industry throughout the 1980s and 1990s, earning another Oscar (shared with Bhanu Athaiya) for his costumes for 1983\u2019s Ghandi. \nMollo will be best remembered for his work on Star Wars, which had a huge impact on the film industry. His designs and concepts helped pave the way for thousands of other science fiction films as they imagined their own gritty, lived-in worlds that still entertain audiences in theaters decades later. \n"}
