{"title": "Asus refreshes ZenBook 3 Deluxe and ZenBook 13 with latest Intel processors", "content": " \nIntel\u2019s eighth-generation processors are here, and one of the big trends we\u2019re seeing at IFA is a slew of manufacturers refreshing their existing laptops with the more powerful chips. Asus is no exception, with the company announcing that both the ZenBook 3 Deluxe and ZenBook 13 will be getting updated versions featuring the new eighth-generation Core i7 Kaby Lake-R chips. \nOtherwise, not much is changing about the two laptops. The ZenBook 3 Deluxe still has a 14-inch screen with ultra-narrow bezels, and can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD space.  Similarly, the ZenBook 13 is more or less the same as the existing model, with an Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU and a 4K display. \nAsus hasn\u2019t announced dates or prices for the updated laptops, but expect to see them out sometime in the near future. \n"}
