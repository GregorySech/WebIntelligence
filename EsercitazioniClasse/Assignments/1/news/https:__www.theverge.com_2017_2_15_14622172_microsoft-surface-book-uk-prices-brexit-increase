TechCrunch first spotted the increase, and a spokesperson for Microsoft told the publication it\u2019s \u201cadjusting the British pound prices of some of our hardware and consumer software in order to align to market dynamics.\u201d Aka, the ongoing Brexit fallout. \nThat means that the base version of the Surface Book (with a 128GB hard drive and an Intel Core i5 processor) that used to cost \u00a31,299 now sells for \u00a31,449. Microsoft clarified, though, that these increases are only affecting direct sales from the company to individuals or other firms. Whether or not Surface Book prices will be affected in UK high street stores will be up to individual retailers.\nThis isn\u2019t the first Brexit price bump Microsoft has introduced, with the firm raising the cost of its UK enterprise software services last October. Since then a number of tech firms have followed suit, including Apple, Tesla, and Sonos. At this point, just be surprised if companies don\u2019t change their prices. \n"}
