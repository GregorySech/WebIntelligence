{"title": "How did American Gods pull off its shocking sex scene? With a lot of clever positioning", "content": " \nIn the premiere of American Gods, a woman named Bilquis (Yetide Badaki) is out for drinks with a man she met online. They\u2019re an odd couple. She\u2019s young, beautiful, and exquisitely dressed. He\u2019s a frumpy, awkward dad. As the date progresses to the bedroom, something begins to feel a little off. \nAmerican Gods has that name for a reason, and Bilquis is hardly your average woman. Shortly into their oddball sex session, it becomes clear that this unlucky man is literally losing himself in her; his entire body is sinking into her vagina like a spaghetti noodle into a slurping set of lips. As he starts to climax, Bilquis places her hand on his head and deftly stuffs him inside of her. Whew! Time for a lay down. \nThe scene is directly lifted from Neil Gaiman\u2019s novel, though bringing it to life on-screen posed a very special sort of challenge. When asked about how the team brought the final version to life, visual effects designer Kevin Tod Haug begins with a single sound. \u201cOof.\u201d \nHaug says this was the very first scene that director-producer David Slade of Hannibal fame was worried about. \u201cIt's the only thing that we all knew what it needed to look like, and we were all scared to death that it wouldn't look like that when we were done.\u201d \nThe team mapped the scene out in storyboards before testing actual shots to figure out what would \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t \u2014 work. Haug says they focused on \u201cthe idea of her growing during the process, him shrinking, the way the room would sort of help us see her, but not see it too clearly.\u201d It required a lot of experimentation. \"Some of the shots got versioned to death,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of those shots at the end was pushing 30 versions.\u201d\n\u201cwe were all scared to death that it wouldn't look like that.\u201d\nBy versions, Haug means multiple iterations of the same camera angle for the same cut. VFX supervisor Jeremy Ball said there were dozens of iterations used for this scene, as some camera angles were much harder to pull off than others. \u201cWhen we're up over her left shoulder looking down at him as he's being absorbed, it was really the trickiest one,\u201d he says. \nThere\u2019s quite a bit of hip wriggling on Bilquis\u2019 part as the scenes moves forward. On top, she commands a position of power during sex. She seems to grow in size before the viewer\u2019s eyes. But her hip sways, which help her devour her prey, factor into how the scene works as well. \u201cI think something we didn't take into account fully on set was the amount to which her movement was going to translate to him as he's pulling forward,\u201d Ball says. \u201cWe thought of it as much more of a linear thing. A lot of the kind of hip movement from her is getting transferred to him in post.\u201d \nAnother subtle trick that factors into how the final version gels, Ball says, is a pulse of light in the deeply red room. \u201cI think the suggestion is that it's candlelight, but it's actually much stronger than that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's kind of illuminating the whole space and [Bilquis]. Editorially, I know that David [Slade] and art worked to sort of play that rhythm of that light across the cut to make it sort of a subliminal rhythm, tying it together, that I think on some level helps you through this transformational aspect.\u201d\nThe finished scene is what Haug calls a visual balancing act: it uses practical, perspective trickery to make someone appear larger on-screen. \u201cIt started out being primarily practical effects that could have just been split together in 2D, so no actual CG.\u201d The scene was then treated with visual effects to tie it all together. \nAccording to Haug, David Slade\u2019s \u201cbiggest, single fear\u201d was that this scene would wind up looking cheesy or downright bad. He credits the final product \u2014 a successful, unforgettable moment \u2014 as the result of planning, experimentation, and a willingness to revise, revise, and revise some more. Oof, indeed. \n"}
