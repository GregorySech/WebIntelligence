{"title": "A Japanese metal band has a website that tracks and rewards energetic headbanging", "content": " \nIf your big problem with headbanging was always that there wasn\u2019t enough reward in it, Japanese electrocore metal band Crossfaith has a fix for the problem. The group has a website that lets you headbang to its music while it tracks your movements through your webcam. The interactive site was launched to promote Crossfaith\u2019s new EP, Freedom. The goal is to headbang continuously while listening to Crossfaith\u2019s music, and at the end of what feels like a tremendously long song, the website grants you artwork and a headbang count.\nThat sounds cool in theory, but in practice, the site senses when you\u2019re getting tired, then complains about it. It throws out a countdown, giving you 10 seconds to get back to headbanging, or risk having your entire progress on the song reset. \u201cWhy are you stopping?\u201d the site demands, like a nagging, unappeasable brat. Headbanging is supposed to be spontaneous and joyous, not a job overseen by a cranky, micromanaging boss.\nMaybe others with stronger necks and craniums will get further with this feature, which does for headbanging what Guitar Hero did for pretending to rock out on guitar. For me, I guess all the punk-rock concerts I\u2019ve gone to don\u2019t really amount to anything, and I\u2019m just not metal enough to earn my way to Headbang Valhalla. I reached 607 \u201cheadbanging moves\u201d before giving up. That earned me this artwork. Maybe you\u2019ll get something more metal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI almost made it!\n\n\n"}
