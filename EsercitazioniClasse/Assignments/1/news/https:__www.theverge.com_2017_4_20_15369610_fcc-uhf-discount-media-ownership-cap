{"title": "FCC takes first step toward allowing more broadcast TV mergers", "content": " \nIn a divided vote today, the Federal Communications Commission took steps that could lead to more consolidation among TV broadcasters, reducing the number of sources of local news.\nThe changes have drawn the ire of Democrats, though they\u2019ve struggled to get the message out in part because the legal mechanics involved are somewhat dense and confusing.\nDemocrats say this will lead to huge mergers\nToday\u2019s changes revolve around the media ownership cap \u2014 a limit on how many households a TV or radio broadcaster is allowed to reach.\nThe rules are meant to promote diversity of media ownership, giving consumers access to different content and viewpoints. The cap currently prevents a company from reaching no more than 39 percent of US households with broadcast TV.\nLarge broadcasters hate the cap because it prevents them from getting even bigger. And since Trump took office and Ajit Pai was named chairman of the FCC, they\u2019ve been lobbying to have it revised.\nThe FCC\u2019s vote today starts to do that. First, it reinstates a rule known as the \u201cUHF discount,\u201d which lets broadcasters have a bigger reach in areas where they use a certain type of technology. And second, it starts plans to revisit and raise the media ownership cap.\nThis is all vaguely related to Weird Al\u2019s 1989 movie UHF\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how much the initial action will change. Major broadcasters, including Sinclair and Univision, are said to be bumping up against the cap. Reinstating the UHF discount might allow for more expansion \u2014 it allows for twice as much household reach by UHF stations \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear that it would be enough to enable big mergers. Some Democrats suspect it will.\nThe UHF discount was put in place in the mid-\u201980s and only removed last September. The \u201cdiscount\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to a price discount, but a discount on how many households UHF broadcasts are considered to have reached. It was put in place because UHF \u2014 ultra high frequency \u2014 TV broadcasting was considered worse and less reliable. (This is part of why we have Weird Al\u2019s 1989 classic UHF, about a guy running a weird low-budget TV station.)\nBut that changed after broadcasters transitioned from analog to digital in 2009. Now, UHF stations are considered to be on par with, if not at an advantage to, other stations. So last year, the commission voted to remove the UHF discount going forward (existing stations were grandfathered in), since its purpose wasn\u2019t relevant any more.\n\u201cWelcome again to industry consolidation month at the FCC.\u201d\nBoth Republicans on the commission \u2014 Pai and Mike O'Rielly \u2014 voted against killing the discount last year, though for different reasons. Pai said the UHF discount can\u2019t be changed without also changing the media ownership cap, since the two are related. O'Rielly argued the commission doesn\u2019t actually have the authority to change either, since Congress last set the ownership cap.\nThat\u2019s the setup for today\u2019s changes: Pai isn\u2019t necessarily saying the UHF discount makes sense, he\u2019s just saying that if it\u2019s being removed, broadcasters should be given other ways to get bigger.\nAnd that\u2019s the bigger part of today\u2019s vote. The commission is promising to revisit the ownership cap later this year. Should it pass something, that\u2019ll go a much further way to enable bigger broadcasters by allowing companies to reach a larger percentage of households.\nThe FCC\u2019s lone Democrat, commissioner Mignon Clyburn, stood in staunch opposition, beginning her remarks by saying, \u201cWelcome again to industry consolidation month at the FCC.\u201d Clyburn said reinstating the discount could let broadcasters reach up to 78 percent of US households, instead of just 39 percent. \u201cMost troubling ...  the discount will actually harm the public interest by reducing diversity, competition, and localism.\u201d\nPai has signaled he wants to allow more local consolidation, too\nPai also heard from Congressional Democrats over the past week. Representative Anna Eshoo sent a letter saying, \u201cFurther consolidation will ensure that there are fewer independent news outlets serving as a counter-balance to misleading or inaccurate information from other sources. This will not serve the public interest or our democracy well.\u201d\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter alongside House commerce committee ranking member Frank Pallone, saying they were concerned that reinstating the UHF discount would allow Sinclair to purchase Tribune\u2019s TV stations.\n\u201cFirst, consumers would lose an independent voice in their media market,\u201d Pelosi and Pallone wrote. \u201cAnd second, consumers could see their cable bills go up because Sinclair charges cable operators more than Tribune for retransmission consent.\u201d\nBut today\u2019s rule doesn\u2019t guarantee that the media ownership cap will actually get changed. In fact, Pai is putting the commission in a bit of a weird position. Clyburn is likely to be opposed, and O'Rielly doesn\u2019t believe the commission has the authority. So it\u2019s very possible that today\u2019s action will simply reinstate the UHF discount, without addressing the situation further.\nIt may also be just the start of Pai\u2019s efforts to allow more consolidation. During a Senate hearing last month, Pai said that he\u2019s also interested in lifting FCC restrictions that prevent the local consolidation of newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations.\n"}
