{"title": "Huawei executive doesn\u2019t see the point of smartwatches", "content": " \nHuawei\u2019s Eric Xu Zhijun, one of the company\u2019s rotating CEOs, doesn\u2019t personally seem to be a fan of smartwatches. \u201cI am always confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones,\u201d he said Tuesday. It\u2019s a fair, skeptical point people have been making since the advent of the smartwatch. Xu\u2019s iffy feelings toward the category haven\u2019t stopped Huawei from producing more wearables, however; the company unveiled the Huawei Watch 2 at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. \n\n\nWait. What does \u201crotating CEO\u201d mean?\nHuawei uses a rotating CEO system that sees each executive serve a term of six months. According to the company, \u201cthe Rotating and Acting CEO acts as the primary person of the\u00a0company's\u00a0operations and crisis management\u00a0during his tenure.\u201d Xu served as rotating CEO from October 1st, 2016 until March 31st of this year. Guo Ping is now back in the role. \n\n\nBut to many consumers who actually do like smartwatches, the Huawei Watch 2 has been viewed as a disappointing follow to its predecessor. It tossed away the classy, formal look of the original in favor of a sporty design. Huawei also crammed in a number of new features including standalone GPS and NFC for Android Pay. \nXu provided some insight on Huawei\u2019s internal deliberations that might explain the drastic shift between the two products. \u201cWhen the smartwatch team in Huawei presents their ideas to me with great excitement, I keep reminding them to consider whether there are tangible needs [for these products] in the market,\u201d he said. \nSo it\u2019s possible that Xu simply wasn\u2019t interested in a Huawei Watch 2 that looked like the original; if Huawei was going to make another one, it had to look different and do more functionally compared to the first model. Xu was only rotating CEO for six months, and the Huawei Watch 2 obviously had a longer product roadmap than that \u2014 but it\u2019s probably a viewpoint shared by many of his fellow executives. \n"}
