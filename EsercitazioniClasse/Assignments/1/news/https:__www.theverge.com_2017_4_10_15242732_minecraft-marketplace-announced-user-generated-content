{"title": "Minecraft is getting a new store for user-generated content", "content": " \nSoon you\u2019ll be able to buy select user creations for real cash within Minecraft. Today developer Mojang announced the Minecraft Marketplace, which offers a curated range of maps, texture packs, mini-games, and other user-created content, which you can purchase using a new virtual currency called Minecraft Coins. The marketplace is coming to both the mobile and Windows 10 versions of the game, and will launch as part of Minecraft\u2019s upcoming \u201cdiscovery\u201d update later this spring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe idea is to give Minecraft creators another way to make a living from the game, allowing them to support themselves in the creation of ever-greater projects, while giving Pocket and Windows 10 players access to a growing catalogue of fun stuff - curated and supplied by us, safely and simply,\u201d developer Mojang explains. \u201cAnd, of course, you can still manually download free community creations you\u2019ve found out there on the internet, too.\u201d At launch, the online market will feature a lineup of content from notable Minecraft modders, but Mojang says that submissions will be open to \u201canyone with a registered business.\u201d\n"}
