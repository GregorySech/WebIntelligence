{"title": "Sony on PS4 Pro: \u2018We see 4K as being the next HD\u2019", "content": " \nIn late 2016, the focus of Sony\u2019s PlayStation division was on hardware. During a span of around 60 days, the company launched three new devices: a slimmer base PS4, the more powerful PS4 Pro, and the PlayStation VR headset. The surge appears to have been largely a success; the PSVR has topped 1 million units sold, while Sony says the PS4 is \u201cclose to\u201d hitting the 60 million mark. \nThe question mark is the PS4 Pro. The company isn\u2019t releasing specific sales data for the upgraded hardware, but it says that since the debut in November, one in five new PS4s sold has been the Pro model. (Sony says the actual number \u201cruns into the millions.\u201d) Nonetheless, Sony is committed to the Pro and the shift its added power represents.\n\u201cWe see 4K as being the next HD,\u201d says Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America, \u201cand PlayStation 4 Pro is our answer to that opportunity.\u201d\nFor many consumers, some confusion remains around the PS4 Pro. While the hardware features an enhanced GPU and the ability to play games and other media in 4K, it\u2019s not always clear which games or developers are actually supporting the device, or what features are only available on the pricier console. \nWhen Prey launched on May 8th, for instance, it purportedly supported PS4 Pro. But it wasn\u2019t until last week that a patch was released, adding in a large number of Pro-specific improvements.\nIn comparison to Microsoft\u2019s upcoming Project Scorpio \u2014 which the company says will offer 4K support and performance improvements for all Xbox One games \u2014 the advantages of upgrading to PS4 Pro aren\u2019t as immediately clear.\nAccording to Jim Ryan, president and CEO and Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe, the responsibility to support the hardware lies with game developers. That is to say, each developer must spend time and resources to tweak and patch their games to take advantage of the PS4\u2019s added power.\n\u201cIt\u2019s down to the individual developer.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where we very much leave it to the content creator to make what they will of the power of the machine,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the proof of the pudding is in the tasting; when you look at something like Horizon Zero Dawn, which is just gorgeous on PS4 Pro, you can see firsthand what the device delivers. Now there are other games where the benefits of Pro are less apparent, and frankly in some cases less necessary. So it\u2019s down to the individual developer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShawn Layden.\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\nProject Scorpio is expected to launch later this year, but at Microsoft\u2019s E3 Keynote on June 11th the company will be revealing more details about the console. According to Ryan, the relative mystery around Scorpio, along with PS4 Pro\u2019s one-year head start, has been advantageous for Sony. \u201cWe were able to get out and lay out our agenda before anybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet when Microsoft will come with Scorpio, there\u2019s much that\u2019s yet to be known about that product. We don\u2019t know the date, we don\u2019t know the price, we don\u2019t know the quantities. So we\u2019re able to get out there and do our thing, and we\u2019re very happy about that.\u201d\n\u201cWe were able to get out and lay out our agenda before anybody else.\u201d\nThe entire concept of mid-cycle upgrades like PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio \u2014 consoles that are more powerful than their predecessors, but not an entirely new generation of hardware \u2014 is still largely unproven territory, and recent studies suggest that a majority of consumers are unaware of the new devices and the advantages they offer. \nHistorically, raw power has had little impact on the success of a console; just look at the meteoric sales of the original Wii compared to the more powerful PS3 and Xbox 360. That said, Ryan believes updates like the PS4 Pro will help Sony appeal to early adopters and those consumers who don\u2019t even know what a PS4 Pro is.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s about trying to strike a balance between having a platform have a certain lifespan that will allow developers to become familiar, and to exploit the platform, but at the same time, to allow those who wish to upgrade mid-cycle to have something that\u2019s new and shiny and more powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we\u2019ve struck really an elegant balance between those two factors.\u201d\n"}
