{"title": "Microsoft announces hardware event for May 2nd in New York", "content": " \nMicrosoft is planning to hold a special hardware and software event in New York City on May 2nd. After weeks of rumors over Microsoft\u2019s plans, the software maker started emailing out press invites today. The event will begin at 9:30AM ET on May 2nd, and sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge not to expect a Surface Phone or a new Surface Pro device.\nWe\u2019re still expecting Microsoft to unveil at least one piece of new hardware, but it\u2019s not likely to have a successor to the Surface Book ready just yet. It\u2019s also possible Microsoft may take this opportunity to reveal the hardware design of its upcoming Xbox Project Scorpio, just ahead of its E3 event in June, or a successor to the Surface 3 which was designed with students in mind.\nOther rumors suggest Microsoft could opt to unveil its Windows 10 Cloud operating system, an alternative to Chrome OS that runs Universal Windows Apps. ZDNet reported this week that Microsoft\u2019s event is codenamed \u201cBespin,\u201d a fictional Star Wars planet that includes a \u201cCloud City.\u201d Sources also tell us that this event will be focused on education, so expect to see any hardware or software be connected to how it can be used in schools.\n"}
