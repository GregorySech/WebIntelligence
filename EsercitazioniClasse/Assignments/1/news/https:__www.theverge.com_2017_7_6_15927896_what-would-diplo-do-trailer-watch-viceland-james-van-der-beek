{"title": "The trailer for What Would Diplo Do? has James Van Der Beek putting a violin in a blender", "content": " \nViceland, the new TV channel co-owned by Vice Media and A&E, debuted the trailer for its first scripted comedy today. What Would Diplo Do? is a mockumentary series about the DJ, producer, and record executive who\u2019s played a huge part in what pop music is in 2017. Along with Skrillex, he\u2019s one half of Jack \u00dc, and he kicked off Justin Bieber\u2019s dance hall renaissance; his studio, The Mausoleum, cultivated major works by M.I.A., Santigold, Shakira, and Christina Aguilera; his primary project Major Lazer has pumped out the dance song of the summer for nearly a decade; and he produced two tracks on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade. He\u2019s super successful, and in this series, he\u2019s also a moron who puts a violin in a blender and bounces around like a toddler. \nDiplo is played by James Van Der Beek, who lampooned his own celebrity in 2012 by playing himself on Nahnatchka Khan\u2019s short-lived (and criminally underappreciated) ABC sitcom Don\u2019t Trust The B in Apartment 23. That show took plenty of its jokes from Van Der Beek\u2019s career as a \u201890s teen icon on Dawson\u2019s Creek and the inherent idiocy of rich teen prodigies, and it appears he\u2019s reusing many of those bits here. \nIt looks like the show could be funny, but it\u2019s also pretty convenient for Viceland to list inspirations like Louie, WorldStar HipHop, and This Is Spinal Tap, but neglect to mention Khan\u2019s direction of Van Der Beek\u2019s oddly specific comedic talents. Or, even more glaringly, The Lonely Island\u2019s 2016 summer hit Popstar, which ridiculed viral music stardom in general and paid special attention to Bieber. Vice can crib from that movie\u2019s sensibility all it wants, but it\u2019ll be hard to match the bizarro catchiness of its original songs.\nHopefully, at least, it\u2019s also a deliberate choice not to mention any of Hollywood\u2019s awful attempts at chronicling the EDM era. Maybe we\u2019ll get through this one without an after-school special about ecstasy. \nThe series debuts on Viceland on August 3rd.\n"}
