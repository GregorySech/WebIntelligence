{"title": "The final trailer for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets shows an incredible sci-fi universe", "content": " \nThe final trailer for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is here, and like the two trailers that preceded it, it\u2019s packed to the gills with wall-to-wall sci-fi action. \nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets stars Dane DeHaan as the titular Valerian, and Cara Delevingne as his partner, Laureline, who are tasked with saving Alpha \u2014 the aforementioned City of a Thousand Planets, an intergalactic melting pot of a metropolis \u2014 from a dark threat that could endanger both the city and the entire universe. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, the film itself just looks incredible, with fantastic vistas and what look like some truly impressive action set pieces. \nDirector Luc Besson also seems to be taking the \u201cthousand planets\u201d part of his title seriously, with the new footage showing off a wide array of environments and enough alien creatures to put franchises like Star Trek or Star Wars to shame. \nThe film itself is actually an adaptation of the French graphic novels Val\u00e9rian and Laureline, which Besson has been working for years to get on-screen. We\u2019ll know if his efforts paid off soon \u2014 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets hits theaters July 21st. \n"}
