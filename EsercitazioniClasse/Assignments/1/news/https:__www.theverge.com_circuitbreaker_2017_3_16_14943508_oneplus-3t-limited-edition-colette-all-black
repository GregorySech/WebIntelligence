{"title": "This limited edition all-black OnePlus 3T is going to be ridiculously rare", "content": " \nThe OnePlus 3T is a hell of a flagship \u2014 of that we\u2019re certain \u2014 but OnePlus does go a bit overboard with its attempts to hype the brand sometimes. The latest example is a new limited edition version of the 3T developed in collaboration with Parisian retailer Colette. The handsets costs \u20ac479 ($510), looks incredibly slick with a new all-black colorway, but will be rarer than hen\u2019s teeth. Only 250 units will be available to buy from the Colette store in Paris on March 21st from 11AM local time. \nAt least \u201climited edition\u201d here really does mean limited. \nThe special edition handset will come with 128GB of internal storage, an engraved rear case, and all the other 3T specs including 6GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 821 processor, and a fast-charging 3,400mAh battery (\u201ca day\u2019s power in half an hour\u201d is the OnePlus slogan). If you want to try and grab one for yourself, first: go to Paris. Then head to Colette\u2019s store at 213 Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 on March 21st and get ready to scramble. It doesn\u2019t half look nice though:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe limited edition OnePlus 3T\nImage: OnePlus / Colette\n\n\n"}
