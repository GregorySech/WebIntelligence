{"title": "Google hires Apple chip architect: are custom chips coming to Pixel phones?", "content": " \nAccording to Variety, a recent hire at Google indicates big changes are coming for future versions of the Pixel phone. Manu Gulati, an Apple micro-architect who worked on the company\u2019s chip development for nearly eight years, has just joined Google, announcing the hire today on his Linkedin profile.\nWith a new title of lead SoC architect, Gulati\u2019s move could, on the surface, arguably point to any number of Google SoC (system on a chip) developments. The company currently has none. It\u2019s a new position for Google, which currently relies on third-party chips for all their products. Nest uses a chip by Texas Instruments, for example, while current Pixel phones use Qualcomm.\nThe focus on developing chips for Pixel, however, seems to be confirmed by a over a dozen new SoC-related job offers posted by Google \u2014 many specific to mobile \u2014 including \u201cHardware Engineer, Mobile SoC Architect,\u201d \u201cMobile SoC CPU Architect,\u201d and \u201cMobile SoC Memory Architect.\u201d The listings include phrases like \u201cArchitect the memory sub-system of a high-end mobile SoC; including core configuration and PPA (performance, power, area) tradeoffs,\u201d and \u201cHelp define the architecture of future generations of phone and tablet SoCs.\u201d\nInternally designed chips were not a focus for Google in the past, but this looks to be changing\nInternally designed chips were not a focus for Google in the past, but this looks to be changing. It\u2019s likely due in no small part to the drastically increased burden placed on phone hardware in recent years to not only handle more processor-heavy experiences like VR and AR, but voice and visual cues without latency. Apple recently debuted Core ML at WWDC, its new machine learning framework API for developers that directly tackles these issues. Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, says the new API makes the iPhone six times faster at image recognition than the Google Pixel.\nWhile The Information reported that Google was in talks to develop their own chips as far back as 2015, it\u2019s become an increasingly crucial step for the company to advance in order to compete with Apple\u2019s iPhone, and really, what consumers are demanding from mobile devices. (Our previous headline from 2016: \u201cThe Google phone is almost as good as the iPhone.\u201d)\nGulati\u2019s hire, coupled with Google\u2019s additional bevy of job listings and recent news that  it\u2019s reportedly offered to invest around $880 million in LG\u2019s Display division, shows a real effort on Google\u2019s end to crank up hardware and mobile efforts for future products.\n"}
