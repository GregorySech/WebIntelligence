{"title": "An internal Google email shows how the company cracks down on leaks", "content": " \nGoogle is facing a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court alleging that the company has fostered a culture of secrecy and fear. Leaks to the media are forbidden, and employees are encouraged to monitor their colleagues for leaks, according to the suit, which was filed in December by an anonymous ex-employee who claims they were unjustly fired.\nContains a \u201cstop leaks\u201d email address\nWe\u2019re now seeing some of the first evidence to support those allegations. Earlier this month, attorneys for the plaintiffs entered an email as an exhibit in the case. The May 2016 document \u2014 one that has been previously quoted from in the lawsuit but not published in full \u2014 describes the result of an internal hunt for a leaker, mentioning a dedicated \u201cstopleaks\u201d internal email address, presumably directing to a team that the lawsuit claims is tasked with such investigations. \nThe story behind the all-staff email starts with an incident from last year. In April, Recode published internal, employee-generated memes roasting Nest CEO Tony Fadell for a decision to shut down products from Revolv, a company acquired by Nest. In response to the criticism, Fadell gave a talk at the company\u2019s weekly TGIF meeting and claimed Nest\u2019s culture, another subject of criticism, was \u201cimproving.\u201d The transcript from the talk was then also published by Recode.\nThe internal email was sent a few weeks later, on May 6th, with the subject line \u201cthe recent leaks.\u201d Written by Brian Katz, a former State Department special agent who now runs \u201cinvestigations\u201d at Google, it begins with a stern warning: \u201cINTERNAL ONLY. REALLY.\u201d\n\u201cINTERNAL ONLY. REALLY.\u201d\nKatz introduces himself as the head of the \u201cstop leaks\u201d team, a group of employees that the lawsuit claims is tasked with tracing the source of information that makes its way to the public. Katz writes that the company identified and fired the leaker for \u201ctheir intentional disregard of confidentiality.\u201d As a result of the leaks, Google stopped publishing transcripts of its TGIF talks, opting for a live stream instead. (The plaintiff who brought the suit says he was falsely accused by Katz of being the source of the leaks.)\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked hard to create an environment where we can share information openly,\u201d Katz writes. \u201cOur culture relies on our ability to trust each other \u2014 we share a lot of confidential information, but we also commit to keeping it inside the company. We don\u2019t want that to change.\u201d He went on to encourage employees to share concerns with managers or through the human resources department, rather than airing them publicly. The Information noted in a story last year that, around the same time, Katz allegedly told employees in a webcast \u201cto look to their left and look to their right,\u201d saying one of those people may be leaking information.\nKatz ended by writing that the conversation had turned \u201cless than civil\u201d inside Google, and points to conversations on internal Google tools like Memegen as problems. \u201cMemegen, Misc, Internal G+, and our many discussion groups are a big part of our culture \u2014 they keep us honest \u2014 but like any conversation amongst colleagues, we should keep it respectful.\u201d \n\u201cWe should keep it respectful.\u201d \nThe lawsuit alleges that Google\u2019s leaks policy covers essentially all company information and prohibits reasonable discussion about company activities. The stop leaks team is a primary object of criticism in the suit, which alleges that the team encourages employees to report any suspicious activity from their colleagues and streamlined the leak-reporting process with a dedicated URL. The email references a dedicated email address as well: \u201cstopleaks@\u201d. Google declined to elaborate on how the stop leaks team works. An attempt at emailing the group resulted in a bounce.\nA related case was also recently brought to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\u201cWe're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,\u201d a Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement. \u201cTransparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment or workplace concerns.\"\nThe full text of the email is copied below.\n\nSubject: The recent leaks\nFrom: Brian Katz\nTo: Googlers\nINTERNAL ONLY. REALLY.\nHi there. I\u2019m Brian. I lead the Investigations team, which includes stopleaks@.\nAt TGIF a few weeks back we promised an update on our investigation into some recent leaks, and here it is: We identified the people who leaked the TGIF transcript and memes. Because of their intentional disregard of confidentiality, they\u2019ve been fired.\nWe\u2019ve all worked hard to create an environment where we can share information openly. Our culture relies on our ability to trust each other\u2014we share a lot of confidential information, but we also commit to keeping it inside the company. We don\u2019t want that to change.\nThat said, we\u2019ll be making some changes to TGIF to help keep the information shared internal-only, starting by no longer posting the written transcript to go/tgif. Instead, you\u2019ll be able to watch a live stream, and for those who can\u2019t tune in live, we\u2019ll be offering the full video with Q&A.\nWe\u2019ll continue to share information internally because the vast majority of Googlers and Characters respect our culture and don\u2019t leak\u2014thank you for that. That commitment toward a common vision and goal makes this a special place to work.\nPlease remember: whether malicious or unintentional, leaks damage our culture. Be aware of the company information you share and with whom you share it. If you\u2019re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter\u2014or to anyone externally\u2014for the love of all that\u2019s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes us a community. If you have concerns or disagreements, share them constructively through your manager, HRBP or go/saysomething.\nWhich brings me to my final point: some of the recent discourse on Memegen and elsewhere within the company has been, shall we say, less than civil. Memegen, Misc, Internal G+ and our many discussion groups are a big part of our culture\u2014they keep us honest\u2014but like any conversation amongst colleagues, we should keep it respectful. \nBrian Katz\nDirector, Protective Services, Investigations & Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
