{"title": "The cinematic obsession with obsessive women has finally met the age of social media", "content": " \nPopular culture has always been interested in women who become obsessed with other women. The trope has been re-imagined and re-skinned over and over, from Single White Female to Notes on a Scandal, from \u201cJolene\u201d to \u201cGirl Crush,\u201d from late Sylvia Plath to approximately 500 of the plot threads on Pretty Little Liars. The stories generally boil down to two explanations for this pathology: secret sexual attraction to other women, or competition for a man\u2019s attention and affection. Sometimes the lines between those two things blur, but there\u2019s rarely any other explanation. \nOne recent exception is Christian E. Christiansen\u2019s 2011 thriller The Roommate, which has a lonely college freshman striving to take over the identity of her pretty, well-adjusted roommate, hoping to make herself whole. This movie\u2019s primary plot device and sole impressive production trick is that the two leads \u2014 Gossip Girl\u2019s Leighton Meester and Friday Night Lights\u2019 Minka Kelly \u2014 are simultaneously recognizable stars and almost identical, with the right wardrobe and lighting. The adrenaline rush of the third act comes from the realization that perhaps Meester really could succeed at becoming Kelly. Who would notice? As a horror movie, it\u2019s rote and boring, with predictable casualties and an obvious ending. As a nearly intentional investigation into the very gendered way that image informs identity \u2014 coincidentally released the first full year Instagram was available in America \u2014 it\u2019s a small marvel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertigo Entertainment\n\n\nNow, finally The Roommate has a logical successor, and some company in the genre of modern obsession. Matt Spicer\u2019s debut feature, Ingrid Goes West, co-written by Bad Sports\u2019 David Branson Smith, sent a small ripple through the summer by pinning down exactly what it feels like to fall for an Instagram influencer\u2019s lifestyle mirage. The avocado toast, the conveniently located neon sign, the perfect artist husband and beautiful friends \u2014 it turns out it\u2019s all staged, which gives the film the first of its many messages about online popularity. \nIngrid Goes West stars Aubrey Plaza at her dramatic and comedic best as Ingrid, a loner whose mother dies of a terminal illness and leaves her with a lot of money and no roadmap. Lonely, confused, and certainly in need of grief counseling, she turns to Instagram and develops an obsession with lifestyle blogger and Instagram influencer Taylor Sloane, played by Elizabeth Olsen. Ingrid picks up and moves to California to manipulate Taylor into becoming her best friend, and to mimic her aesthetic, which she confuses as interchangeable with happiness.\nIngrid Goes West isn\u2019t the only horror story to deal with social media and female obsession in 2017. There\u2019s also Tyler MacIntyre\u2019s Tragedy Girls, Anita Rocha da Silveira\u2019s Kill Me Please, and Simon Verhoeven\u2019s Friend Request, films that dabble in the same themes with varying levels of attentiveness, empathy, and success. Together, they suggest a growing interest in exploring social media obsession, sometimes even beyond the usual demonization of women as shallow or self-obsessed. It makes sense: for a majority of the population under the age of 29, growing up involves dealing with Instagram, and this sort of pathology now feels like a standard trial in a coming-of-age story. It\u2019s not just something a narcissist experiences.\ninstagram disillusionment is now a standard trial in a coming-of-age story\nBut Ingrid Goes West remains the standout, addressing the dark side of social media with a level of care that gives its subjects a way into the conversation, too. The Cut interviewed Instagram influencers who were shocked to see their lives reflected back to them in Ingrid Goes West. \u201cThis is my life, and it\u2019s psycho,\u201d said one. The film struck a nerve, not just with its canny specificity, but with its slapdash, wild gestures at something that feels true about life online. Even women for whom Instagram is not just a lifestyle, but a livelihood, were ready to step back from posting to the app after watching the film. \u201cIt was almost like looking at yourself in a mirror,\u201d one said. \u201cI had to ask myself if I was crazy, too. Like, \u2018Why are you doing this to yourself, why do you keep doing this?\u2019\u201d\nBy now, people know that Instagram is a highly curated version of a real life, and one where the in-between, banal moments have no place. That doesn\u2019t prevent it from having power over our emotions. When Ingrid Goes West came out in August, I asked the director what he thought the protagonist really needed from Instagram. \u201cI don\u2019t think Ingrid knows how to ask for what she needs in terms of validation or human affection,\u201d he said. \u201cSo she starts looking for it the only way she knows how: through her phone, because she\u2019s alone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not surprising that filmmakers would start looking for basic human truths in stories about Instagram. They have every incentive to make movies about buzzy, controversial topics, and social media is one of the biggest of the decade. Zan Romanoff\u2019s recent novel Grace and the Fever charts a young woman\u2019s coming-of-age alongside the delineation of online and IRL personas. Romanoff told me in May that the internet is a perfect jumping-off place for a story about growing up: \u201cThe question of coming-of-age is the enormous question of \u2018how can you be yourself?\u2019 So really anything, almost anything relates to that. How do you be yourself is such a huge question, everything is involved in it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Bananeira Filmes\n\n\nDa Silveira\u2019s Kill Me Please is about a young woman\u2019s slow realization that her fascination with her own image was instilled in her by the community and the culture around her. The world only sees the girls in this movie as pretty things on Facebook, and archetypes rather than people. Da Silveira seems to set up four choices for young women in her fictional town: they can be invisible; they can be aestheticized in death as martyred virgins; they can be beautiful, delicate survivors; or they can be imaginary, described only as fantasy or urban legend. The teenage protagonist\u2019s fascination with Facebook makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s where she\u2019s going to go to figure out which prescribed box she fits in, and wriggle around to see what, if any of it, is up to her to decide. \nThese good-faith attempts at understanding a turning point for coming-of-age stories make it all the more disappointing to see satires as rudimentary as Friend Request or Tragedy Girls. The first is supposed to be campy horror, featuring a demon girl with crippling FOMO and a life-destroying tactic predicated on depriving victims of their Facebook friends. The second is centered on two anti-heroines who crave online fame to the point where they\u2019re murdering classmates and town figureheads in order to boost traffic to their blog. In both, there are elaborate, bizarre explanations for how the girls developed such fervent obsessions with violence \u2014 necessary backstory, sure \u2014 but not a whisper of why social media became so important that it took over their lives. The implication is that social media obsession is just a natural, gross part of the girl experience, an inherent flaw in the girls themselves. Even if that were true, it\u2019d still be unfeeling and boring to state it, then leave the statement unexamined.\nThe age of Instagram (and Facebook, which acquired the site in 2012) has created legitimate concern about how social media affects the mental health of young women. Between 2005 and 2014, a Johns Hopkins study found that rates of depression rose significantly in America, and disproportionately among girls. Speaking to NPR, psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair speculated on one possible cause: that women and girls saw net gains during that same time period for employment, education, and salary, but are still \u201cbombarded by media messages, dominant culture, humor and even political figures about how they look \u2014 no matter how smart, gifted, or passionate they are.\"  \nIf we\u2019re broken, and looking for something to fix us, why do we think to go online?\nThis spring, a Royal Society for Public Health survey of social media users between age 14 and 24 found that of the available social media outlets, young people described Instagram as the most detrimental to their mental health. The report\u2019s author told CNN that Instagram was associated with anxiety, depression, and issues with self-identity and body image, saying that the platform encourages women to \u201ccompare themselves against unrealistic, largely curated, filtered, and Photoshopped versions of reality.\u201d In January, a Common Sense survey found that teenage girls are particularly susceptible to anxieties around social media, with 35 percent saying they worry about being tagged in unattractive photos, and 22 percent saying an unsatisfactory number of likes on a photo made them feel \u201cbad about themselves.\u201d \nThis summer and fall, that knowledge has given rise to a batch of films that try to tackle what social media platforms really do when integrated into the center of young women\u2019s life. What do we need from them? If we\u2019re broken, and looking for something to fix us, why do we think to go online? In an August essay for The New Republic, titled \u201cAgainst Instagram,\u201d Josephine Livingstone argued that Ingrid Goes West revealed Instagram\u2019s basic moral bankruptcy. \u201cIn satirizing Taylor Sloane\u2019s pretty, empty, commercial life, Ingrid Goes West points a finger at the proximity of Silicon Valley and venture capitalism to domestic aesthetics,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstagram is owned by Facebook, and both companies trade in the currency of normal people\u2019s images and information.\u201d Here\u2019s where the lines between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cinfluencer\u201d \u2014 Ingrid and Taylor Sloane \u2014 blur. You don\u2019t even have to follow \u201cinfluencers\u201d before you can be influenced by an aesthetic reinforced by a secret algorithm, and following influencers can feel as intimate as following the people you know in real life. \nBeing a person is hard. Connecting is hard, showing affection is hard, deciding what to wear and what to eat and how to live is hard. We look to people in our daily lives for examples of how to do it better. When friends and family fail, or aren\u2019t available, why not look to the millions of girls on the internet? It might not actually make women happier, but the impulse to seek happiness and fulfillment is understandable, and social media pretends to offer those things in abundance. What makes us want to believe in things we consciously recognize as crafted illusions? We might not know yet, but we\u2019ll continue to get more interesting stories \u2014 and certainly more interesting movies \u2014 if we think of social media obsession as human and relatable, not just a plot device to mark a character as shallow and dumb. \n"}
