{"title": "OnePlus says \u2018jelly\u2019 scrolling effect on OnePlus 5 is normal", "content": " \nOnePlus\u2019 latest flagship phone has gotten critical acclaim for its fast performance and clean software, but some owners of the new device have complained about a weird jelly-like effect that shows its face when scrolling through an app. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed on the OnePlus 5 review unit provided to The Verge, and a Reddit thread has other owners reporting (and speculating as to what\u2019s causing the issue) it, as well.\nIn a statement regarding the issue, OnePlus says \u201cthe OnePlus 5 uses the same level of high-quality components as all OnePlus devices, including the AMOLED display. We've received feedback from a small number of users saying that at times they notice a subtle visual effect when scrolling. This is natural and there's no variance in screens between devices.\u201d\nDue to the company\u2019s claim that the effect is normal and not the result of any manufacturing issues, filing for a warranty replacement will likely not resolve the problem for those that can see it. That may not be much consolation if you\u2019ve purchased a OnePlus 5 and can see the jelly scrolling issue, but the company does offer a 15 day return policy if it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t live with.\n\n"}
