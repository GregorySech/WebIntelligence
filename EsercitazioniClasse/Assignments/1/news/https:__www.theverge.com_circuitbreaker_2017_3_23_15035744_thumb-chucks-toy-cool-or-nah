{"title": "Thumb Chucks want to be the new yo-yo and that\u2019s just not going to happen", "content": " \nI received both an email pitch and physical delivery of Thumb Chucks yesterday. What are Thumb Chucks, you ask? It\u2019s a new toy that is essentially two rubber light-up balls connected by a thick ribbon. See here:\n\n  \n  Rain, sleet, or snow. @cameronarant can't be stopped.  #ThumbChucks #Begleri #edc #skilltoy A post shared by Thumb Chucks (@thumbchucks) on Jan 18, 2017 at 3:09pm PST\n\n\n\nThe idea is that you do tricks with these balls, like the person above. Apparently it was inspired by a rosary that Greek kids carry around? I read the press materials that accompanied the Thumb Chucks once, and that was what it said. Maybe I hallucinated it? But I\u2019m pretty sure. \nIt\u2019s clear that Thumb Chucks wants to be the next yo-yo, or Devil Sticks, or Hacky Sack. It\u2019s cheap, too, at $9.99. But I can\u2019t imagine it becoming a viral sensation like any of those things. When I held it in my hands, my first thought was, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d I realize I\u2019m not a kid with an endless amount of time on my hands to learn a new skill, but still, I don\u2019t get it. Maybe this would be cool for club kids? Club kids like strobe lights, so this seems like a natural fit. \nI will say, though, that our video team here at The Verge happens to love yo-yos. I asked out motion graphics director, William Joel, for his thoughts, and he had this to say: \u201cIt's not a yo-yo, it's not a nunchaku. It fits awkwardly in my hands, and I'm not a child. But they are fun to throw around.\u201d \nSo there you have it: Thumb Chucks. Will they be the next yo-yo? Probably not, but kids are unpredictable and highly susceptible to marketing, so maybe we have a hit on our hands.\n"}
