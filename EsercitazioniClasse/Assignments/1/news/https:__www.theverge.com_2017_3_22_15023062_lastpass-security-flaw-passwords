In an outline of the problem, Ormandy explains that a coding flaw allowed anyone to \u201cproxy\u201d unauthenticated messages to a LastPass browser extension. By exploiting the problem, a hacker could obtain access to privileged LastPass commands \u2014 including \u201cthe obviously bad ones,\u201d such as \u201ccopying and filling in passwords (copypass, fillform, etc).\u201d \nLastPass, in a short blog post released today, explained that the issue was related to an experimental feature on all LastPass browser clients. (Ormandy reported multiple vulnerabilities, although the company said they are \u201clargely the same.\u201d) The company issued a fix before the vulnerability was publicly revealed, and says updates for users should be applied automatically. LastPass is not currently asking users to update any passwords. \n\u201cWe have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but we\u2019re doing a thorough review at this time to confirm,\u201d the company said in the blog post. \u201cWe will soon provide a more comprehensive summary of the events and what our community needs to know.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ormandy has reported an issue in LastPass. Last year, the researcher sent a report on \u201ca complete remote compromise\u201d to the company. On Twitter, this time he credited LastPass with a swift response. \u201cVery impressed with how fast @LastPass responds to vulnerability reports,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf only all vendors were this responsive.\u201d\n"}
