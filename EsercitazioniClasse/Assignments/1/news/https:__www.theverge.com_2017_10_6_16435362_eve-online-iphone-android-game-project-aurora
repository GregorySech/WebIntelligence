{"title": "EVE Online is getting a mobile spinoff", "content": " \nThe vast sci-fi universe of EVE Online is coming to your smartphone. This evening EVE developer CCP Games announced a new spinoff of the massively multiplayer game, that will be released in a handful of countries in \u201cthe near future,\u201d before getting a full global launch sometime next year. The free-to-play game is called Project Aurora, and is being developed by Finnish mobile studio PlayRaven.\nThe new game looks surprisingly like EVE, which first launched in 2003 and offers a dizzyingly complex universe for players to explore. \u201cFor years and years we have wanted to bring the EVE universe to mobile devices in a way that is tailored to the platform and EVE fans,\u201d CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar Pe\u0301tursson said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how the developer describes the upcoming spinoff:\nIn Project Aurora, players must work together to dominate the center of the galaxy, and become the most powerful corporation in the universe. Project Aurora will be a massively multiplayer\u200b \u200bmobile\u200b \u200buniverse,\u200b \u200bfilled\u200b \u200bwith\u200b \u200bepic\u200b \u200bplayer\u200b \u200bstories.\nThose player-created stories are a large part of EVE\u2019s appeal. The game often makes headlines for massive in-game space battles that result in the loss of ships that cost thousands of real-world dollars. Players have formed their own religions. It\u2019s so complex that someone even wrote a book about EVE\u2019s player-driven history and politics.\nAurora won\u2019t be the first spinoff of the popular game either; CCP has also delved into virtual reality with the space shooter EVE Valkyrie. Last year, in an attempt to reinvigorate the aging game, CCP announced plans to make EVE a free-to-play experience. \"We\u2019ve been doing everything we can to bring more people into our spectacular sandbox,\" the developer said at the time.\n"}
