{"title": "Industrial robots in the US are being deployed exactly where you\u2019d expect", "content": " \nMore than half of America\u2019s industrial robot population is concentrated in just 10 states in the Midwest and South. This is according to a new report, published by the Brookings Institute, which maps the distribution of these machines in the US. The report defines industrial robots as \u201cautomatically controlled, reprogrammable machines,\u201d and estimate that the US is home to 233,305 of them \u2014 engaged in tasks from welding cars to processing poultry. \nThe report uses data from a study published earlier this year by economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo. That study concluded that for every new robot added to the workforce, between 3 and 5.6 jobs are lost in the surrounding area. (The Brookings Institute disputes this analysis, and claims that these local losses don\u2019t necessarily translate into national statistics.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial robots in the US are mainly used in the Midwest and upper South\nImage: Brookings Institute\n\n\nAs part of the institute\u2019s focus on the local impact of automation, this week\u2019s report shows that the use of industrial robots is geographically concentrated. Michigan has the most (nearly 28,000; about 12 percent of the country\u2019s total), followed by Ohio (20,400), and Indiana (19,400). Not surprisingly, auto manufacturing hub Detroit is the top robot user in terms of metropolitan areas, with more than 15,000 robots installed \u2014 more than three times any other metro areas. By comparison, the entire West of the country accounts for just 13 percent of the industrial robot population.\n\u201cFor good and ill, then, this is where the industrial robots are and aren\u2019t,\u201d writes the Brookings Institute\u2019s Mark Muro in a blog post. \u201cLong to short, their incidence reflects the nature and geography of the nation\u2019s highly automated advanced manufacturing sector.\u201d\nMuro notes that as the spread of industrial robots is geographically concentrated, so too is the fear of their impact. He points out that historically Republican states have more than double the number of robots per workers than Democrat states \u2014 2.5 robots per 1,000 workers compared to 1.1 robot per 1,000 workers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of robots per thousand workers in red states and blue states.\t\nImage: Brookings\n\n\n\u201cThis is not to say robots determined the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d writes Muro. \u201cHowever, the red-state robot concentration does suggest that to the extent industrial automation brings difficult labor market transitions and anxiety, it will visit those difficulties most heavily on a particular swath of red-leaning America \u2014 specifically, the most robot-exposed locations in the industrial Midwest.\u201d\nPresident Trump campaigned heavily in red states, and repeatedly promised to bring back manufacturing jobs. Economists have pointed out that restoring the lost jobs in this industry would be a momentous task, as, thanks to increased productivity, creating even half of the 6.4 million manufacturing jobs lost since 1980 would mean increasing the manufacturing output of the US by 26 percent \u2014 equivalent to opening 100 of Tesla\u2019s planned \u201cgigafactories.\u201d \n"}
