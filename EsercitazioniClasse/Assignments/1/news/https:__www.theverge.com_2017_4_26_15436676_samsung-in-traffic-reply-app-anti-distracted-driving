{"title": "Samsung has a new auto-reply app for avoiding distracted driving", "content": " \nDistracted driving is a problem. It\u2019s dangerous for you, it\u2019s dangerous for other people on the road, and it\u2019s increasingly an issue as we become more and more attached to our smartphones. Samsung is trying to combat that with a new app called In-Traffic Reply that\u2019s designed to help people avoid using their phones while driving or biking by automatically sending preset replies when in motion.\nCleverly, In-Traffic Reply relies on the phones GPS sensor to figure out when you\u2019re driving at which point calls and texts will be automatically responded to with either a default reply of \u201cI\u2019m driving, so I cannot answer at the moment,\u201d an animated image, or a custom message. Samsung hasn\u2019t said how exactly the app will work if you\u2019re a passenger in a vehicle, but presumably there\u2019s some way to manually turn off the automatic functionality. \nThe app is currently in beta in the Netherlands, and should roll out to the Play Store in May. \n"}
