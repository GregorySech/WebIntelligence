{"title": "Disney\u2019s Star Wars-themed land will be called Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge", "content": " \nDisney always puts a big focus on its parks at D23 Expo, and today it revealed some important new information about the upcoming Star Wars lands. First off is the official name. They\u2019ll be called Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge, tying into the overall concept of the lands being set on a remote planetary outpost that\u2019s outside the normal hustle and bustle of space travel.\nWalt Disney Imagineering portfolio creative executive Scott Trowbridge revealed some additional details about the two rides in the park, as well. Chewbacca will be present, utilized as part of the narrative set-up to the Millennium Falcon attraction. As revealed earlier this year, that ride will let teams of visitors take the controls of the starship, which will be a key part of the immersive aspect of Galaxy\u2019s Edge. According to Trowbridge, if visitors do well while piloting the Falcon they\u2019ll be rewarded with extra Galactic Credits. If not, they may find themselves hunted by a bounty hunter elsewhere in the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the planet\u2019s surface to the inside of a Star Destroyer\nThe second ride has up until now just been vaguely described as a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. However, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Bob Chapek did reveal during the presentation that the ride will take visitors off the planet Galaxy\u2019s Edge is set on, and into the interior of a Star Destroyer. Concept art shown during the presentation also portrayed guests in a ride vehicle facing off against two AT-AT walkers, and while the images weren\u2019t addressed directly, it seems clear that the face-off will be part of that second attraction.\nThe new Star Wars lands have been pitched as fully immersive environments, where everyone from the shopkeepers and vendors that people buy food from will be characters in the actual Star Wars universe, rather than traditional Disney employees. Trowbridge stressed that point during the presentation, calling the new park \u201ca living place\u201d where guests will have the opportunity to have their own adventures. But while Galaxy\u2019s Edge will take place on an unfamiliar planet, that doesn\u2019t mean familiar characters won\u2019t appear. Along with Chewbacca, Trowbridge revealed that BB-8 and Kylo Ren will also be part of the park \u2014 though to what degree it wasn\u2019t entirely clear. Disney\u2019s original Star Tours ride will also factor in, with the droid pilot Rex from that attraction serving as a DJ in a local cantina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step in Disney\u2019s theme park evolution\nThe Star Wars expansions represent the next evolution in Disney\u2019s larger theme park strategy. Universal\u2019s Wizarding World of Harry Potter helped change what audiences were looking for in a theme park. Instead of a standalone environment filled with themed rides, the focus turned more towards immersive worlds, where visitors could feel like they were stepping inside their favorite films and TV shows. Pandora: The World of Avatar, which opened earlier this year, represented a big step forward with that approach. Pandora recreates the planet from James Cameron\u2019s 2009 film as a tourist destination, with the plot and characters from the movie serving as nothing more than distant backstory.\nThe goal of Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge is to take that approach, and then overlay it with narrative and more enhanced interactions to give visitors the sense that they are truly living in the world of Star Wars. It\u2019s an ambitious goal, but judging from the detailed model revealed here at D23 the new expansions are certainly on the right path towards creating an immersive physical environment. Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge is scheduled to open in both California and Florida in 2019, with the Disneyland expansion opening before the Disney World location.\n"}
