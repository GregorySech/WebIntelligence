{"title": "These golden headphones were crafted by a mad genius", "content": " \nWhat you see before you are the Final Audio Piano Forte X in-ear headphones, which cost a spectacular $2,199 and look, in the merciless words of a friend of mine, \"like mini butt-plugs.\" Not only are they expensive and garish, they aren\u2019t even all that impressive technically. But if you think that\u2019s a recipe for a total luxury tech disaster, you\u2019d be wrong. These weird headphones sound good, fit well, and embody a unique recklessness \u2014 both from the designer and purchaser \u2014 that ensures their long-term exclusivity.\nFinal Audio is a Japanese company that is niche even by the high standards of extremism of Japanese audiophilia. Its late founder Kanemori Takai, who passed away in 2014, was known for his eccentricity and insatiable desire for \"creating something never seen before.\" In an age when every audio designer was eyebrows-deep in empirical measurements and target response curves, Takai shrugged off modern methods to tune everything with his own ear. And it\u2019s that nonconformity that finds its expression in the Piano Forte series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Piano Forte X is a pair of gold-plated, chrome copper earphones with a large cone protruding from one end and a peculiar, enlarged nozzle on the other. There are no silicone tips to be found in the fancy box \u2014 you just insert them as they are. And yes, that is an inconvenience on cold winter days, when you\u2019ll have to literally warm these metal buds up before popping them in. But the crazy thing is that they\u2019re perfectly comfortable after the initial temperature adjustment. The Piano Fortes nestle into the curve of the ear and sit just inside the ear canal. I\u2019m especially fussy about fit with in-ear headphones, and these simply defy their looks: they\u2019re neither heavy nor clunky, and I\u2019ve worn them for many hours with only the pleasure of the music in my ears.\nSo very different, so very pleasant\nAnd this is the thing that makes me unwilling to dismiss these earphones as silly excess: they\u2019re beautifully musical. That\u2019s the only word I can offer you in defining their unique sound. It\u2019s completely out of sync with any other modern headphone, in-ear or over-ear, to the point of making almost everything else sound screamy at the high end and far too boomy at the low end. Even Final Audio\u2019s own Sonorous X flagship over-ear cans (also gold-plated, priced at a truly eye-watering $4,999) sound unrefined and excessive in their bass in direct comparison to the Piano Forte X. The Piano Fortes are unfailingly pleasant, but don\u2019t misread that as being soft and overly sweet like your grandfather\u2019s toffee candy \u2014 they still have bite and impact where it counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can think of the sound of these in-ears as akin to their external design: in the same way that the metal case has been filed down to a pristine, perfectly smooth finish, so too the sound has been whittled down to only its essential, musical elements, and the result is simply pleasurable. After listening to the Piano Forte X, my recollections of the experience are always positive, irrespective of the mood, tempo, or style of music. I\u2019ve listened to everything from Anohni and Bonobo to The xx and Zomby, with a few classical pieces thrown in between, and I\u2019ve never regretted a moment of it. These headphones are more faithful to the tastes of their designer than the intent of the musician \u2014 but you know what, I\u2019d rather grab a spot on that bandwagon, because it\u2019s just a more enjoyable ride.\nThe headphones for when you want to let go of all sobriety and rationality\nWhen looked at with sobriety and objectivity, the Piano Fortes cost an order of magnitude more than a shiny curio with a good sound signature should. The braided wire, like the rest of their construction, feels wonderfully strong and of a very high quality, but it tangles easily and is permanently attached. I wouldn\u2019t advise you to buy $500 headphones without a replaceable cable, and that omission is even more egregious at four times the price. The Piano Fortes also use air vents to generate their particular sound, which means they\u2019re nowhere near as discreet as a typical pair of in-ear buds. Sound leaks out from them and seeps back in from external sources \u2014 which is cool if you want to remain aware of your surroundings, but renders these rather pointless on a long commute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut to analyze them rationally is to completely miss the point of these headphones. It\u2019d be like compiling a list of pros and cons comparing vinyl to digital music. The people who buy the Piano Fortes do so for the rustic smell of their leather pouch, for the organic feel of metal warming up on contact, and for the sense of owning something exceptional. Final Audio has a somewhat saner-priced Piano Forte VIII, made out of brass instead of gold and copper, but the Forte X is the model for that one time you decide to let go of your sanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Piano Forte X\n            \n\n              Vlad Savov\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
