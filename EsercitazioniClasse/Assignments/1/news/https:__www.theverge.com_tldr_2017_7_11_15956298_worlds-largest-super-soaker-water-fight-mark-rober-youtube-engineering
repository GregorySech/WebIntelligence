Or, if you\u2019re YouTuber Mark Rober (formerly a NASA engineer), it\u2019s time to build the largest water gun ever made (via Gizmodo).\nRober\u2019s giant water pistol is a little more overpowered than the original backyard toy, firing jets of water at 272 miles per hour, with enough force to slice through a watermelon and shatter glass. But despite the giant scale, the supersized Super Soaker works pretty much the same way as the toy version: pressurized air is pumped into a chamber of water, and released with the trigger to shoot a jet of water. Rober\u2019s version instead uses pressurized tanks of nitrogen gas and water for far more impressive results,. But hey, it\u2019s all working on the same principles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo: Mark Rober\n\n\nRober is no stranger to building comically oversized children\u2019s guns. Last summer, he put together the world\u2019s largest Nerf gun. While that was impressive, the 40-mile-per-hour darts it shot barely hold a candle to the destructive power of the seven-foot-long water pistol. \nThe gigantic Super Soaker is definitely a custom, one-off build, though Rober does provide a build list of parts and CAD files should you want to try to cobble together your own. As a note: pressurized gas as used here is dangerous, and Rober is a trained engineer, so proceed carefully if you\u2019re trying this at home. This is not meant for human targets!\n"}
