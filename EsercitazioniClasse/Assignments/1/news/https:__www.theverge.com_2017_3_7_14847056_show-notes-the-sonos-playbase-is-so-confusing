{"title": "Show Notes: The Sonos Playbase is so confusing", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nTomorrow is A Day Without A Woman \u2014 a protest in which many women are not showing up to work in order to stand for equality and fair labor practices. (A good explainer is here at Vox.com.) Many female members of The Verge\u2019s staff are participating, but The Verge is a news organization and won\u2019t be involved directly. We will be covering the strike, however, and running several pieces from our female staff members about their experiences in technology, science, and culture. It\u2019s going to be an interesting day.\nOUT WITH THE OLD SONOS, PLEASE SHOW US THE NEW SONOS\n\nSonos announced the Playbase last night, a $699 speaker that\u2019s built into a TV stand. Chris Welch went to the event, here\u2019s the video:\n\n\nI have a medium-sized Sonos system \u2014 two Play 1s, a Play 5, and a Connect Amp, and I love it. But I have no idea why Sonos made such a big deal about the Playbase \u2014 the company\u2019s future is clearly in integrating microphones into their hardware products and working more closely with voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa. The company is also opening up control of the system to music services like Spotify directly, which is a good thing, although it\u2019s a bit messy right now.\nTo be fair, the Playbase has been under development for a long time, and Sonos now has a new CEO who says he wants the company to move faster. So you can\u2019t really look at the Playbase to see too far ahead into the future of Sonos. Even though my dear friend and notable Verge traitor David Pierce certainly tried. \nBut I can\u2019t get over how ancient the Playbase is as a technology product \u2014 it\u2019s a $700 connected speaker that only supports 2.4GHz b/g WiFi because the SonosNet mesh protocol hasn\u2019t been updated for modern networks. It also lacks HDMI in favor of optical input and doesn\u2019t support surround codecs like DTS. It\u2019s basically a Playbar in a bigger box with more speakers. Which is great and I\u2019m sure some people will buy it, but the Playbar came out in 2013 \u2014 it\u2019s fair to wonder why Sonos is still shipping the same basic capability set four years later.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Playbase really only makes sense if you have other Sonos products in your house \u2014 if you just want a better speaker in a giant box under your TV, it\u2019s actually hard to spend more than $500 on a highly-rated competing model from Yamaha or Sony or ZVOX. (My mother-in-law has a ZVOX, it\u2019s dead-simple and sounds great.)\nAnd if you want to use the Playbase as the heart of a 5.1 system, you\u2019ll end up spending a wild $1,800: $700 for the Playbase, $700 for the Sonos Sub, and $200 each for Play 1s as surround speakers. And you still won\u2019t get HDMI switching or modern surround codecs like DTS or Dolby Atmos for that money.\nYou could just buy a highly-rated soundbar system with rear speakers and a subwoofer in the box and a $349 Sonos Connect to integrate your streaming music and come out anywhere from $500 to $1000 ahead. \nSo who is this for? Someone who already has a Sonos system and doesn\u2019t mind paying a huge premium to add another Sonos-integrated speaker under their TV? That seems like a tiny market \u2014 especially when Amazon is rumored to be working on a new Echo with better speakers, an idea that is blindingly obvious to everyone.\nHere\u2019s Dieter\u2019s interview with new Sonos CEO Patrick Spence. Let\u2019s hope the Playbase is the last of the old Sonos, and we see what\u2019s up with the new Sonos in very short order.\n\nIPHONES OR DOCTORS\n\nRep Jason Chaffetz stuck his foot in his mouth today when he suggested poor people spend their money on health insurance instead of brand-new iPhones.\nThere are lots of reasons this is a bad line of argument \u2014 and Chaffetz walked it back pretty quickly \u2014 but I think Adi Robertson did an excellent job laying out the main issue: smartphones aren\u2019t luxury items, especially for the poor. They are often primary computing devices, and it is hard, if not impossible, to participate in the modern economy without a computer. What\u2019s more, investing in a computer like the iPhone, which has a stellar security record, excellent service and support, and a rich ecosystem of spare parts and skilled gray market repair techs, is actually a very smart use of money if you don\u2019t have a lot of it. Adi couldn\u2019t get her HTC phone repaired in New York City! Just go read her piece.\n\nHARRY POTTER FCC JOKE\n\nOne blessed day passed without FCC news, but don\u2019t get too used to it. Today: President Trump renominated Ajit Pai to another five-year term as Chairman.\nAlso today: the ACLU, EFF, and 169 other groups (including a Harry Potter fan club!) wrote a letter to the FCC and Congress in support of net neutrality.\nTomorrow: Pai goes to Congress for his first hearing in front of the Senate Commerce Committee.\nSometime: Pai comes on The Vergecast. We are going to make this happen.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\nTwitch added a new feature called Pulse, which is basically Twitter for gamers. Casey Newton thinks this is how a service like Twitter gets disrupted:\nIf Twitter were ever going to be disrupted, this is exactly what I\u2019d imagine it would look like at the beginning. Take a small but rabid group of core users, bootstrapped off an existing social network, and give them a core subject to discuss. (Recall that Twitter\u2019s initial growth came largely from the San Francisco tech community discussing itself.)\nCounterpoint:\n\n\nQ: Chris, how would you describe your personal hell?A: https://t.co/hxMG9usEOm pic.twitter.com/KKEJn7WMTW\u2014 Chris Plante at GDC (@plante) March 7, 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe CIA has the ability to hack Samsung smart TVs and spy on people using the built-in microphones and cameras, according to new docs released by Wikileaks. This isn\u2019t surprising in the slightest, but as we add more and more mics and cameras to our homes through smart assistants, it\u2019s just going to get more and more prevalent.\nRelatedly, Amazon dropped its motion to rule that Alexa data is protected by the First Amendment after the suspect in the murder case at issue granted the cops permission to see his Echo logs. This is a ruling that Amazon needs sooner or later; we\u2019ll see how and when other police agencies decide to push the issue.\n\nNest finally added two-factor auth, but... you still can\u2019t login with your Google account? Hmmm.\nThe Galaxy S8 just can\u2019t stop leaking out: today there are side-by-side photos of the S8 and larger S8+. It looks very nice, I\u2019ll give it that.\nFinally, Vlad is at the Geneva Motor Show, looking at extremely pretty new supercars. I want this Mercedes-AMG GT Concept very badly.\n\n"}
