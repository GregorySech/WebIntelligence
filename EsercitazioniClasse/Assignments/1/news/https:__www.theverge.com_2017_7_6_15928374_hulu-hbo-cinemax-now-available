{"title": "Hulu now offers HBO \u2014 just in time for Game of Thrones premiere", "content": " \nHulu has become the latest reseller of HBO. Today the company announced that subscribers can add HBO to their service for an extra $14.99 per month. That\u2019s basically the same price as you\u2019d pay for HBO Now anywhere else. Hulu\u2019s HBO add-on is available to customers on all subscription plans, so you can get it both with the traditional, on-demand streaming service and Hulu\u2019s newer live TV offering. Hulu is also launching a Cinemax add-on today for $9.99 monthly \u2014 a bit less than the premium that HBO demands. \nHowever, you can only watch HBO and Cinemax on devices that have been updated with Hulu\u2019s redesigned user experience. Hulu\u2019s refreshed look accompanied the launch of its $39.99 live TV product, but it\u2019s also the new standard for customers on the $7.99 and $11.99 (no commercials) streaming plans. Currently, the new Hulu experience is available on Android, iOS, Apple TV, and Xbox One, with more platforms due to be added over the summer. Hopefully that includes Roku.\n\nCustomers who pay for the HBO add-on will be able to sign into the HBO Now app with their Hulu account credentials. But Hulu is promising a \u201cseamless\u201d integration that will include the live, linear HBO and Cinemax channels, plus on-demand libraries of their respective original shows and movie collections. \nMore live channels will be added over the next few weeks. Those include: HBO 2, HBO Family, HBO Latino, HBO Comedy, HBO Signature HD, HBO Zone, MoreMAX HD, ActionMAX HD, ThrillerMAX HD, MovieMAX HD, 5StarMAX HD, and OuterMAX HD. But for now, Hulu wants to make sure you\u2019re set for the July 16th season premiere of Game of Thrones. \nIf you\u2019re keeping score, you\u2019ve now got a slew of options for subscribing to HBO outside of a regular cable bundle. They include:\n\nAmazon (direct subscription)\nAndroid (direct subscription)\nApple TV / iOS (direct subscription)\nDirecTV Now\nHulu\nPlayStation Vue\nRoku (direct subscription)\nSling TV\n\nAnd I\u2019m probably forgetting some. In April, Recode reported that Apple is aiming to package HBO, Showtime, and Starz into a single \u201cpremium TV\u201d streaming bundle. At the time, the company hadn\u2019t struck a deal with any of the networks \u2014 and the bundle hasn\u2019t materialized in the months since. \n"}
