{"title": "Apple releases urBeats3 earphones with new design", "content": " \nAmong all the hubbub at Apple\u2019s iPhone event yesterday, something else was released that wasn\u2019t mentioned onstage: new urBeats3 earphones. The modestly priced earphones come with a Lightning connector and are featured in three colors: matte silver, matte gold, and black.\nApple says the earphones feature a \u201cfine-tuned acoustic design\u201d with an axial-aligned driver as well as secure-fit wingtips and magnetic earbuds. There\u2019s also a RemoteTalk button to activate Siri, take calls, and control your music with one push. Unlike the urBeats2, which were white with color accents, the urBeats3 feature all-over color. They\u2019ve been slightly redesigned, with tilted earbuds and a smoother housing. For those who still have an audio jack, the urBeats3 do come in a version with a 3.5mm plug, with completely different color options \u2014 gray, white, black, and blue \u2014 to remind you that no, you do not own a new iPhone.\nOther products have also been given a color refresh ahead of the new iPhones\u2019 ship dates, as noted by 9to5Mac. The BeatsX earphones are now offered in matte silver and matte gold, and iPhone Lightning dock is available in black, silver, gold, space gray, and rose gold.\nApple\u2019s urBeats3 earphones will retail for $99.95, and will be available this fall.\n"}
