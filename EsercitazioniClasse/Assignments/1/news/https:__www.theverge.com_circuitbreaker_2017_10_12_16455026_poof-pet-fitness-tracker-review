{"title": "My cat ate (part of) his fitness tracker", "content": " \nI live with a six-month-old cat named Pretzel who likes to sprint from one side of my apartment to the other, and sometimes pounce on me with his claws out along the way. He\u2019s the first pet I\u2019ve ever had, and living with him is mostly a joy. But because he\u2019s my first pet, I\u2019ve often been really uncertain of what to do: am I feeding him too much or too little? Do I actually need to brush his teeth? And what do I need to do to make sure he stays healthy?\nThat last question had me pretty interested to check out Poof, a fitness tracker designed for cats and dogs. Poof has two models \u2014 a rechargeable pill-shaped option, and a larger battery-powered version \u2014 and the company sent me both to test out. So I wrestled my cat\u2019s collar off him, clipped the pill-shaped tracker on, replaced it, and waited for the data to come in.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoof\u2019s app.\n\n\n\nIt turns out, pet fitness data is about as enthralling as your own fitness data. For the first few days, it was absolutely fascinating. I found out that Pretzel sleeps most of the time while I\u2019m away and only occasionally wakes up and walks around. And I could see that when I was playing with him, he was really getting a workout. Poof\u2019s app has leaderboards that rank pets of similar age and species, and Pretzel immediately shot to nearly the top of the charts (obviously, because he is a great cat and is very serious about exercise). There were a couple times when I even played with him some more just to boost his rankings.\nBut after a few days, checking the data got boring. Poof\u2019s app doesn\u2019t let you view the information it records in much detail; there\u2019s only a broad, hourly view that you have to look at day by day, which meant I had no way to compare Pretzel\u2019s activity over time, or zoom in to see exactly how active he was throughout a given hour. The app also estimates calories burned, which might be helpful for a pet with weight issues, and gives your pet a daily score based on their activity. It wasn\u2019t really clear to me what to do with either number, though. As best I can tell, there aren\u2019t any standardized activity guidelines for cats, so you have to rely on Poof\u2019s seemingly arbitrary scoring system to tell you how your pet\u2019s doing.\nThere were bigger issues than just my own inability to take fitness data seriously. Poof\u2019s app is unresponsive and painfully slow. I used it on an iPhone 5S, which is kind of old at this point, but that\u2019s only because Poof\u2019s Android app failed to detect both fitness trackers the company sent me. The app doesn\u2019t send encouraging push notifications or synopses either, so you have to remember to open it every day, sync the data, and then decide how to act. I\u2019m not usually one to ask for more push notifications, but I wish Poof would have nudged me every now and then to do something for Pretzel.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat remains of the plastic housing.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the part where my cat ate a piece of the fitness tracker. The pill-shaped Poof tracker fits inside of a soft plastic housing with a metal ring on it, which you can then clip to your pet\u2019s collar, making it easy to remove the tracker for charging. I came home one day to find the housing still attached and the fitness tracker missing; at some point during the day, Pretzel must have fought it off his collar. I\u2019ve been searching my apartment all week, and I still can\u2019t find it. It\u2019s really small. (I\u2019m pretty sure that Pretzel didn\u2019t consume the tracker component. It\u2019s too big for him to eat, and it still syncs over Bluetooth.)\nI had hoped to recover the fitness tracker within a couple days, but the search came up short and instead, Pretzel started attacking the plastic housing that was still around his collar. I thought it was funny at first, so I ignored it. But I\u2019m pretty sure he ended up eating the corner off of the housing, so even if I do find the fitness tracker, I\u2019ll now have to find another way of attaching it to him. I\u2019ll admit, Pretzel eating plastic is kind of my own fault \u2014 don\u2019t worry; he\u2019s fine \u2014 but the fact that he could break the tracker free from the housing seems like a flaw. I can\u2019t imagine it being an issue with dogs, but I have to guess that other cats will try this. (Poof also includes a less dangly housing, but it\u2019s only for bigger collars.)\nI suspect dog owners might get more use out of Poof; dogs don\u2019t lie around quite as much as cats, and the data could help them figure out how long of a walk to take with their dog. But in general, I\u2019m not sure how much a pet fitness tracker is going to help anyone. Just like with an actual activity tracker, it\u2019s ultimately up to you to find the willpower to follow through on a workout. And for me, at least, the guilt of not playing with my pet enough gets me most of the way there.\nWhile writing this article, I attached the larger, battery-powered Poof tracker to Pretzel so that I could take some photos. I noticed that the larger tracker uses a hard plastic housing, instead of a soft one, which would have prevented Pretzel from eating it. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t really care. The first thing he did when I clipped it on was try to get it off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretzel photography by Jake Kastrenakes / The Verge \n"}
