{"title": "Google announces last security update dates for Nexus and Android phones", "content": " \nWhile using a phone with an outdated operating system is occasionally annoying, the thing that signifies the true death of a smartphone is when it stops getting security patches. Google has previously announced when various Nexus phones would stop getting OS updates, and the company has updated that list to note when phones in the Nexus and Pixel lines will stop getting security updates, as noted by Droid Life. \nNone of this is strictly news, given that Google has had a policy in place for a while that Nexus and Pixel devices will \u201cget security patches for at least 3 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store, or at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device, whichever is longer.\u201d But it\u2019s nice to have everything laid out in one place to easily find out when your phone won\u2019t get updates. \n"}
