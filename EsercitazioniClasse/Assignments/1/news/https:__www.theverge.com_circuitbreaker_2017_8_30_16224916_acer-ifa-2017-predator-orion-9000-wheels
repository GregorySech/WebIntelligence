{"title": "Acer put wheels on its latest gaming PC", "content": " \nToday at IFA, Acer announced a bunch of computers, including some new additions to its gaming-focused Predator line. Their unveiling was the usual parade of water-cooled rigs, neon lighting, and pumped-up graphics cards, but there was one feature that stood out on the company\u2019s new Predator Orion 9000 PC: a pair of wheels. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed in the video, but we\u2019ve actually put wheels on this one!\u201d said Acer exec Steven Funcke on stage. \u201cSo even though this is a very big chassis, it\u2019s even going to be a little bit portable for you.\u201d You can see the wheels for yourself in the teaser video above, or in the full unveiling below, starting at 44 minutes in for the Orion 9000:\n\nThis PC is only a little bit portable though. The Predator Orion 9000 \u2014 which Acer says is its most powerful gaming desktop to date \u2014 is damn hefty, thanks to its high-end innards. You can kit the Orion out with an Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition 18-core processor, up to two NVIDIA GTX 1080i graphics cards, and up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. There\u2019s also built-in liquid cooling and space for up to five fans to direct air through several discrete \u201cthermal zones\u201d in the chassis. \nAll that makes for one Big Rig. And if you\u2019re regularly pulling the Orion 9000 out from underneath your desk (to plug in new mice or keyboards, for example), or thinking of taking it to any LAN parties, then, yes, those wheels are actually going to be very useful. It is, at least, less ridiculous than Acer\u2019s Predator 21 X \u2014 an $8,999 gaming laptop so gargantuan that it comes with its own wheeled suitcase.\nAccording to Acer, the Predator Orion 9000 will be available sometime around \u201cthis holiday cycle\u201d with a price of around \u201c$2,000 to $3,000.\u201d Catch it when it rolls out, later this year. \n"}
