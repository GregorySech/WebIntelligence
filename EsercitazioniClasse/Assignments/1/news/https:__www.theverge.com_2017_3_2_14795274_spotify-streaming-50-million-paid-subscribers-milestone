{"title": "Spotify now has 50 million paid subscribers", "content": " \nSpotify continues to cement its place as the leader in music streaming, and today the company announced that it just hit another milestone of 50 million paid subscribers.\n\n\nThank you to our 50 million subscribers. #Spotify50 pic.twitter.com/eXkOV71bwu\u2014 Spotify (@Spotify) March 2, 2017\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s impressive growth for the company, which went from 30 million subscribers last March to 40 million in September to 50 million as of today. And when you add in free users, that number jumps even higher to over 100 million Spotify customers. \nNo matter how you slice it, it\u2019s a firm lead for Spotify when compared to its competitors. Apple Music, as of the last official update in December, is at a comparatively small 20 million \u2014 still impressive, given Spotify\u2019s head start, but there\u2019s still a ways to go for Apple before it catches up. Meanwhile, Tidal is even farther behind, with a reported 1.1 million subscribers as of last October, although there are also claims that Tidal may have been inflating its numbers. \n"}
