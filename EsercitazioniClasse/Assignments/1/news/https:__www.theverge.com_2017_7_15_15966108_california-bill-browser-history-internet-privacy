{"title": "California is facing a major battle over internet privacy", "content": " \nWhen the Congress voted in March to overturn landmark FCC privacy rules, consumers and advocacy groups were incensed by the decision. The FCC rules that were set to go into effect would have forced internet service providers to get permission from customers before selling their data to third parties. The vote seemed to be a bow to the telecom industry, with few redeeming qualities for internet users.  \nNew state bills would reinstate the rules\nIn the outrage that followed, local legislators around the country have floated more than a dozen measures that would reinstate similar rules in their jurisdictions. Illinois, New York, and several other states are now considering bills that would provide the FCC protections, either by introducing entirely new privacy measures, or by amending existing legislation. So far, the majority of those measures are still under consideration, but California is facing a major trial in coming days, as state Senate committees debate Assembly Bill 375 \u2014 a measure that could be a bellwether for similar debates in other states. \nCalifornia Assemblymember Ed Chau first introduced the measure through an anachronism in state deadlines, entirely gutting an unrelated bill and replacing it with the broadband privacy measure. Similar to the FCC\u2019s scrapped rules, the measure would require \u201cprior opt-in consent\u201d from customers before services \u201cdisclose, sell, or permit access to that customer\u2019s personal information.\u201d It would also require that service providers make \u201creasonable security procedures to protect customers\u2019 personal information.\u201d\nAB 375 faces unusually high hurdles\nBut AB 375 faces an unusually high series of hurdles before it can go to a full vote in the Senate. It must make its way through multiple committees, which have the opportunity to kill it before it gets to the full Senate. (The bill could also be pulled until next year\u2019s session.) Last last month, the Electronic Frontier Foundation noted, the bill seemed to be stalled in the Senate Rules Committee, and would be dead if it didn\u2019t see a vote ahead of a deadline for legislation later this month. The measure has since been moved ahead, but now faces three different committee hearings over three days, starting on Monday. \nEFF legislative counsel Ernesto Falcon says the decision to send the bill through those committees gives \u201cas many bites at the apple to defeat the bill\u201d as possible, as any one of the committees could end the process. \u201cWhen you move on to the larger body, you just have a more consumer-friendly legislative body,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThat means there are three chances to strike it down \u2014 so that\u2019s not great,\u201c says Chris Conley, a policy attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. The Sacramento Bee wrote an editorial this week in support of the bill, but also said the three committees were an ominous sign for the legislation. \u201cA triple referral is a rarity, generally reserved for bills destined for the trash heap,\u201d the Bee writes. \u201cWe hope Chau defies the odds.\u201d  AT&T, the EFF noted this week, has been pushing back on the legislation, arguing that current privacy protections are sufficient.\nShould the measure pass the committees and the Senate, the debate wouldn\u2019t be over \u2014 the California Assembly will still need to approve the bill before the governor decides whether to sign it into law. But Falcon says a win in the Senate would give the bill momentum, and make it more difficult for legislators to take a stand against the tide. \nBroadband privacy legislation is broadly popular\nBroadband privacy legislation is broadly popular. Falcon points to a recently released poll that found supports for similar measures across party lines. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty explicit on where voters are, whether they\u2019re conservative or liberal,\u201d he says. But that, of course, didn\u2019t stop national lawmakers from overturning the FCC\u2019s rules, despite the likely foreseen pushback. \nWhether states take a different approach isn\u2019t yet clear. Should California pass its consumer protections, other states may move ahead with their own equivalents. As Conley says, other lawmakers can point to California when it leads on legislation, saying \u201cthis is the most populous state in the country and this law is functioning well.\u201d\nBut if the measure is quietly blocked by a committee, with minimal fallout, it seems possible that other legislators could see the opportunity to quietly duck. As bills in other states, including Illinois and New York, sit in committees, the stakes for California\u2019s bill could go well beyond the Golden State. \n\n"}
