House, who is 52, will remain as chairman until the end of the year. Sony\u2019s Playstation arm flourished under House, which saw the company come back on top in the gaming industry. House drove the strategy and launch of the PS4, which is set to touch cumulative sales of 78 million units this fiscal year. Under his tenure, the PS4 outsold Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One by more than three to one.\nHouse has been with Sony for 27 years, first serving in corporate communications before helping to launch the original PlayStation console. Most recently, he worked on the surprisingly successful PlayStation VR headset which was released around a year ago and has sold more than one million units. \"PlayStation has been a huge part of my life for more than 20 years but with the business having achieved record-breaking success, now seemed to be the right time for me to pursue new challenges,\u201d House said in a statement. \n\n"}
