{"title": "Hulu adds a simple, straightforward channel guide to live TV on the web", "content": " Six months after launching its live TV service, Hulu is acknowledging that the completely redesigned app introduced alongside it still has plenty of room for improvement. The company has made numerous updates to the user experience since May; Hulu now does a better job of highlighting new episodes and surfacing important live events like sports games. But today it\u2019s making another move: the web version of Hulu\u2019s live TV player is getting a very straightforward channel guide. \u201cOne of our key learnings from our Live TV viewers is that our live content feels, at times, hidden or harder to get to than you would like,\u201d Ben Smith, Hulu\u2019s head of experience, wrote in a blog post.\u201cWe know that many of you love the new UI, but we also know that many of you miss having a channel guide for Live TV,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo, on the web experience for live TV, we have enhanced the UI to make it easier to see what\u2019s on now, what\u2019s on next, and change the channel while you watch and plan for your afternoon or night of TV.\u201dYou can bring up the new guide from the new icon in the lower left corner while watching live TV or just \u201chover your cursor near the left side of the browser window.\u201d It displays what\u2019s currently on for each channel, and you can click the right arrow next to each show to see what\u2019s up next. Right now, the new guide is exclusively available on Hulu\u2019s web player, which itself remains in beta at the moment. \u201cToday, the dynamic guide is available on the web and we are eager to learn how you use it before we roll it out to additional platforms in the coming months,\u201d Smith said. So everyone using Hulu on mobile devices, streaming boxes, and game consoles won\u2019t see it. For them, the closest equivalent is either the \u201cMy Channels\u201d section on the primary Home tab or a more exhaustive listing of every live channel under \u201cNetworks\u201d in the Browse section. But it seems likely that Hulu aims to bring this guide to more platforms in a way that fits each one appropriately. Despite a fair amount of criticism that has been directed at the new Hulu design, Smith says the changeover has already produced good results. \u201cOn average, viewers are spending 5 percent more time with Hulu and consuming a greater number of newly discovered TV series and movies,\u201d he said. And more recent improvements have seen viewership of live content jump by 70 percent since August. "}
