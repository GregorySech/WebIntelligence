We\u2019ve been eagerly waiting for news on the show, which will air April 30th on Starz. \nThe show is written by Bryan Fuller (of Hannibal and Pushing Daisies fame) and Michael Green (who co-wrote the dark new Wolverine movie Logan). It stars Deadwood\u2019s Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday, and The 100\u2019s Ricky Whittle as protagonist Shadow Moon. The show will run for eight episodes, and will first screen during this year\u2019s SXSW festival on March 11th. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nAmerican Gods' first teaser is here\n\nThe show will take some liberties with Gaiman\u2019s novel, with his blessing \u2014 back in December, we learned that the author helped invent a new character, Vulcan, as a way to address \u201cAmerica\u2019s obsession with guns and gun control,\u201d according to Green. \nFirst published in 2001, American Gods followed the idea that the world\u2019s mythological creatures and gods existed based on the belief of worshippers, and that many of these gods ended up in the United States as people immigrated to the country. The novel follows Shadow, a former convict recruited by Mr. Wednesday to reclaim the former glory of the older gods, as they face off against newer, more modern gods. Like Gaiman\u2019s signature comics series, Sandman \u2014 which is also theoretically heading for the screen, in spite of many, many setbacks \u2014 it\u2019s a story about how myths change over time, in spite of or because of the world around them. On April 30th, we\u2019ll finally get to see how this particular myth has changed since it was first published as a book.\n"}
