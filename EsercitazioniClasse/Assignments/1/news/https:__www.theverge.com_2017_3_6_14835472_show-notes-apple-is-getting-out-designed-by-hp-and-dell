{"title": "Show Notes: Apple is getting out-designed by... HP and Dell?", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nA bit of a slow day in tech news, as Trump\u2019s second cut at his immigration ban swallowed much of the news cycle. We\u2019ll be covering that closely \u2014 as we\u2019ve said repeatedly, immigration is very much an issue for the tech industry and community \u2014 but there was some other stuff going on today as well.\nVERGECAST LIVE AT SXSW\nWe\u2019re doing The Vergecast live at SXSW on March 12th and 14th! Come hang out if you\u2019re in Austin \u2014 details here.\nGO FAST, TURN LEFT, DON\u2019T WRECK YOUR CULTURE\n\nTwo big pieces from our transportation section to bookmark and read. Andy Hawkins has been steadfastly reporting the endless string of Uber mishaps, and today he asked the obvious question: Can Uber be saved? Lots of quotes from investors and former employers, but my big takeaway is that the company has a talent retention and recruiting problem that spells doom over time. Who wants to work at Uber right now? There\u2019s a lot of money out there for tech talent that understands cars and self-driving; Uber can\u2019t survive if it can\u2019t attract the best people. \nAnd over the weekend Sean O\u2019Kane covered how Nascar is rebooting itself, with different race formats, far more data collection, and even a computer vision system that can detect when pit crews try to cheat by jumping out into pit lane early. It\u2019s a super interesting story, and Sean also took some incredible photos of the Daytona 500.\n(All that Nascar tech is running on Surfaces and Microsoft cloud services, by the way. It\u2019s a promotional deal, sure, but there\u2019s something about having a traditional PC in that form factor that seems very smart for these kinds of applications.)\n\nHP AND DELL, LEADERS IN DESKTOP PC DESIGN?\nSpeaking of traditional PCs, Dan Seifert has been clogging up desks in our new office for weeks with all manner of neat-looking all-in-ones, and today he issued his proclamation: the desktop PC is finally cool. It\u2019s a weird thing when Apple doesn\u2019t seem to be pushing PC design forward at all compared to... HP and Dell? Here\u2019s the video:\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Dell, HP, and Microsoft Surface Studio all-in-ones are relatively underpowered, though. Paul Miller and I have been talking about a review series where Paul just reports back on whether a given default shipping configuration of various PCs can play Overwatch. Thoughts?\nWe updated our Nintendo Switch review with a score and thoughts on the final software. Here\u2019s Andrew Webster with a very low-key burn:\n\n\n\nincreasingly convinced that the switch launch lineup is actually great\u2014 andrew webster (@A_Webster) March 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe Switch\u2019s Joy-Con controllers are Bluetooth, so you can pair them with Windows PCs, Macs, and Android phones \u2014 you need some keymapping software to make it all work though. Neat. But no iOS, even though it would be super cool if Nintendo extended its Super Mario Run deal by releasing classic games that could be played on iOS devices with a paired Joy-Con. Just a thought, please don\u2019t @ me.\n\nMore photos of the Galaxy S8 leaked out, and I am just utterly confused as to why the company put the fingerprint reader next to the camera lens. Reaching to unlock your phone and smudging your camera seems like an easily avoidable problem, no? \nCounterpoint: a lot of people tweeted at me that maybe Samsung is assuming you\u2019ll unlock the phone with face detection or a retina scan, and this won\u2019t be a problem at all. We\u2019ll see.\nLauren Goode covered the new Fitbit Alta, which has heart rate detection. Making it... basically a smaller Charge 2? As Lauren points out, Fitbit\u2019s sales seem to be correlated to new product introductions, so the company has a major incentive to flood the market with Taco Bell-like remixes of the same few ingredients in various cases. And some sort of smartwatch is coming soon. We\u2019ll see.\n\nAJIT PAI UPDATE\n\nNot a peep from the FCC today, as far as I can tell; the immigration ban was the clear focus of government today. But FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeney wrote an op-ed for The Hill saying that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s move to halt the FCC\u2019s privacy rules on internet providers is a big mistake, because the FTC can\u2019t actually prevent ISPs from sharing your personal data. Complicated!\nAs always, Pai is welcome on The Vergecast. SXSW, perhaps?\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\n\nLogan came out over the weekend, and as Chris Plante noted in our staff meeting today, the movie hits almost every base at The Verge. There are self-driving cars! References to patent law! Logan, uh, probably has an NFC chip in his finger? Sure. Anyhow, there\u2019s tons to discuss, and Tasha Robinson, Kwame Opam, and Megan Farokhmanesh did a Logan post-watch conversation piece about it. (I love these.)\nAndrew Liptak interviewed Dan Panosian, who created the bespoke Wolverine comics featured in Logan. All together, he mocked up 10 covers for the film.\nThe PlayStation Vue streaming TV service now lets you watch three channels at once, which the company says will be good for sports fans. With Sling, DirecTV, YouTube, and Sony all in the streaming-TV mix, I\u2019m eager to see more competition and innovation around the actual TV viewing experience, even if this particular idea seems a little silly.\nAll of these companies have basically the same channel bundles, give or take, so really all they can compete on is price and functionality. Which is always good for the people buying the stuff.\nFinally, the rare headline that says everything but also rewards you for looking at the photo: This self-driving van concept from Volkswagen looks like a pissed-off toaster.\n\n"}
