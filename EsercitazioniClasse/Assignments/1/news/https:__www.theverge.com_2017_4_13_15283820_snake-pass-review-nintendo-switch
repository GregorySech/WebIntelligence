In a stacked year that\u2019s already brought a staggering number of incredible, vast, life-consuming releases ranging from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Persona 5, you could be forgiven for not being especially interested in a video game about a snake called Noodle. And, well, fair enough \u2014 time is limited, and Snake Pass isn\u2019t going to be topping too many best-of-the-year lists come December.\nBut I\u2019ve been playing it anyway; it\u2019s the ideal game to squeeze in between lengthy bouts of Zelda or Persona. Here are three reasons why. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA NEW TWIST ON AN OLD IDEA\nI was pretty horrified when I read my colleague Nick Statt\u2019s preview of Yooka-Laylee earlier this year. Not because Nick did anything wrong, but because the game sounded like my idea of abject hell: a resurrection of N64-style collect-a-thon platformers with cutesy cartoony mascots. Even as a kid I thought those games were awful and I have no desire to return to that era today.\nSnake Pass is also very much in that vein. There\u2019s even an annoying kookaburra buddy that insists on interrupting you. But unlike Donkey Kong 64, Banjo-Kazooie, or apparently Yooka-Laylee, it\u2019s a much more enjoyable experience because it focuses on making movement itself the basis of the game rather than just the way you reach the next piece of glowing fruit. The control scheme is really unusual \u2014 you move Noodle around almost like a vehicle, propelling him forward with the right trigger and using the left to slow down while controlling the elevation of his head with face buttons. It sounds complicated, but works well once you\u2019re used to it.\nThough there are certainly a lot of items to collect along the way, most of the challenge in Snake Pass comes from traversing the environment by wrapping Noodle\u2019s slinky form around various objects. Simply getting from A to B tends to be a physics puzzle in itself. That\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t actually make a game like Snake Pass on the N64, and that\u2019s also why it\u2019s an entertaining and original proposition in 2017.\nSWITCH GOES HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH RIVALS\nSnake Pass is also intriguing from a technical perspective. I\u2019ve been playing the Switch version, and it\u2019s the first fully new game to come out on Nintendo\u2019s hybrid platform at the same time as it releases for the PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox One. That means it\u2019s our first look at how new games might run on Nintendo\u2019s comparatively underpowered system \u2014 how much of a technical compromise is necessary to take your console games on the go?\nDigital Foundry has an excellent in-depth comparison that I\u2019d encourage you to read, but the headline is \u201cSnake Pass on Switch holds up nicely against PS4.\u201d That\u2019s really the main takeaway here. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Snake Pass looks great on Switch, with lush environments and impressive effects. It\u2019s cut down from the PS4 version, to be sure \u2014 it runs at a higher resolution and with more visual pyrotechnics on Sony\u2019s platform. But the graphical experience is comparable, despite the huge gap in horsepower.\nThis is just one game, of course, and it doesn\u2019t mean that the Switch would do a good job of running something more ambitious like Horizon Zero Dawn. But as a demonstration of how the Switch can keep up when reproducing a midrange Unreal Engine 4 title, it\u2019s encouraging, particularly considering that developer Sumo only had a few months to create the Switch port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMO DIGITAL STEPS OUT\nLastly, Snake Pass is also a coming-out party of sorts. It\u2019s developed by Sumo Digital, a British studio that is best known for its long association with Sega. Sumo made its name with excellent console versions of arcade titles like OutRun 2 and Virtua Tennis, with the relationship leading to the surprisingly wonderful Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed. \nMore recently, it\u2019s been working on major titles like LittleBigPlanet 3 for Sony and Crackdown 3 for Microsoft. But Snake Pass is Sumo\u2019s first fully original work in the nearly 15 years since it was set up, meaning it represents a major effort from the studio to be noticed on its own terms.\n\nSo that\u2019s Snake Pass. At $19.99, it\u2019s an inventive title that\u2019s worth checking out if you haven\u2019t already had your free time blitzed by the recent barrage of astonishing releases \u2014 and especially if you\u2019re a Switch owner looking for something to play between now and Arms. \n"}
