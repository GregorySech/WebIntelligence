{"title": "The Persona 5 vinyl soundtrack will be a massive, expensive addition to your collection", "content": " \nIam8bit is selling Persona 5\u2019s big ol\u2019 soundtrack as two separate vinyl versions to admire and then carefully tuck away into your dusty collection. First up is the $100 \u201cEssential Edition,\u201d a 4-record LP that is a curated list of the game\u2019s most popular songs, rather than a definitive collection. For that, you\u2019ll need to grab the Deluxe Edition, six records spanning 110 songs for $175.\nThe music itself is a cool mix of jazzy, upbeat tracks, but what the collection will look like is a mystery. Unlike most of iam8bit\u2019s musical vinyl collections, which have included games like Monument Valley, Journey, and No Man\u2019s Sky, the design for the set isn\u2019t final. That\u2019s because iam8bit plans to document the process of creating the set with videos, photos, and interviews. If you\u2019re (understandably) on the fence about dropping so much cash on a collection you haven\u2019t seen, it\u2019s worthing noting that the Deluxe Edition will be a limited pressing. \nBoth vinyl collections are up for preorder now and are expected to ship in Q4 2017, \u201cin time for the holidays.\u201d If you want to listen to it the old-fashioned way, the game\u2019s soundtrack is already up for grabs on iTunes.\n"}
