{"title": "Dozens of people got diarrhea from puppy poop bacteria", "content": " \nThat little doggie in the window could give you diarrhea, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say \u2014 particularly if it came from Petland. \nThe agency is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection that gave 39 people in seven states stomach aches, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), vomiting, and fevers. The bacteria, called Campylobacter, usually spreads when people eat raw or undercooked chicken. But the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture discovered a surprising source for this latest outbreak: puppies. \nAll of the people infected \u201cwere exposed to puppies sold through Petland stores,\u201d the CDC reports. Twelve were Petland employees. The rest had either bought a puppy from the nationwide chain shortly before the illness started, visited one of the stores, or had been in the home of puppy purchased from Petland. \nThe investigation is continuing, but the CDC called the Petland puppies a \u201clikely source.\u201d The agency has already found a smoking gun: when investigators sequenced the genomes of the Campylobacter found in some of the puppies\u2019 feces, they discovered that the bacteria was a close genetic relative to the bacteria found in one of the infected humans\u2019 poop. \nThe bacteria probably spread in the traditional way: insufficient hand-washing. When people touched the poop of a sick dog, and then touched food, they might have exposed themselves, the CDC says. Infected dogs can show the same symptoms as people \u2014 but only some of the Petland puppies appeared ill, the Washington Post reports. Of course, dogs can\u2019t complain aloud about stomach aches.\nThe good news is that pet owners don\u2019t need to plastic-wrap their pooches. They just need to wash their hands after touching their animal, its poop, and its food \u2014 and to take their puppy to the vet if it looks sick. \nIf you\u2019re serious about avoiding an infection from your dog, don\u2019t let Fido lick you on or around your mouth, the CDC advises. It makes sense, really. Anyone who\u2019s watched a dog lick itself knows where that tongue has been. \n"}
