{"title": "Apple sued by Japanese company that owns Animoji trademark", "content": " A Japanese company, which owns the trademark for \u201cAnimoji\u201d in the US, is suing Apple for using the word to name its iPhone X feature.The Tokyo-based company, Emonster, filed the suit on Wednesday in US federal court, saying, \u201cApple made the conscious decision to try to pilfer the name for itself.\u201d The company\u2019s CEO, Enrique Bonansea, is a US citizen living in Japan.Emonster\u2019s Animoji app on iOS, which shares the same name as Apple\u2019s iPhone X feature.Emonster owns an iOS app called Animoji that launched in 2014, which lets people send emoji that are animated in a loop like GIFs. The app asks you to compose the message kind of like how you would format a line of code in Python or Javascript, with parentheses and brackets that separate the kinds of effects you want to add to text or emoji. The app costs $0.99 on iTunes.The iPhone X\u2019s Animoji feature, meanwhile, lets people transform their face into customized moving emoji, taking advantage of Apple\u2019s face recognition technology. It was the funniest and quirkiest thing about Apple\u2019s new flagship phone. The lawsuit alleges that because both the Animoji app and the iPhone X feature are on Apple\u2019s platforms, and because they both involve moving animation, the court should rule one out.According to the suit, Apple knew about Emonster\u2019s ownership of the Animoji trademark because the app is in the Apple Store. Apple allegedly offered to buy the trademark, and when it was turned down, kept using the name anyway.Although Emonster has owned the trademark for Animoji since 2015, Apple filed a petition this September to cancel the trademark, so the registration is now under review. Apple said that because of a filing error, Emonster registered the trademark to a nonexistent business and therefore can\u2019t actually own \u201canimoji.\u201dEmonster is seeking an unnamed amount of money in damages and a court order to immediately block Apple from continuing to use the name. We\u2019ve reached out to Apple for comment."}
