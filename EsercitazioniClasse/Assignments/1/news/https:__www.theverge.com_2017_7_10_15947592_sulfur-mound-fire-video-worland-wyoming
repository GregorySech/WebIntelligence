{"title": "This blue sulfur hellfire in Wyoming is mesmerizing \u2014 and toxic", "content": " \nOn July 7th, fire chief Chris Kocher at the Worland, Wyoming volunteer fire department received a phone call alerting him of a \u201cblue glow\u201d in a rural area off Highway 20 North. As soon as he arrived onsite and looked at the blazing area through binoculars, \u201cI saw we had a sulfur fire,\u201d Kocher tells The Verge. \nThe fire looked like a carpet of sparkling blue blaze. In a video posted by the fire department on Facebook \u2014 which has been viewed almost 2 million times \u2014 you can see flames moving quickly across the surface, sometimes raising up into the air. It\u2019s mesmerizingly beautiful \u2014 and also really dangerous. If you breathe the smoke, it can harm your lungs and even kill you.\nlike a carpet of sparkling blue blaze\nWhen sulfur burns, it produces sulfur dioxide, a harmful gas that forms sulfurous acid when it comes in contact with water, including the moisture in your lungs. Sulfurous acid is related to acid rain, which can kill trees and fish. To keep safe, the firefighters at the scene were wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus, which is why in the video you can hear a Darth Vader-ish breathing noise (as The Washington Post points out).\nPutting down a sulfur fire isn\u2019t the same as dealing with a regular fire: in fact, the crew used only a small amount of water from the fire truck plus firefighting foam. That way, the temperature of the sulfur could be cooled down below 309 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 when it\u2019s in a molten stage \u2014 so that a crust formed at the surface. \u201cAnd then the fire\u2019s out,\u201d Kocher says. The whole thing took about 20 minutes.\naccidentally ignited by the exhaust of a motorcycle\nThe sulfur mound is leftover from the Texas Gulf Sulfur Plant, which operated north of Worland in the 1950s. The sulfur is mixed heavily with soil, the Facebook post says. It\u2019s not 100 percent sulfur concentrate, but it\u2019s still highly flammable. The 10,000-square-foot area that went ablaze Friday night was accidentally ignited by the exhaust of a motorcycle, Kocher says. The area hadn\u2019t seen a sulfur fire in about 12 years, but the crew was prepared because there are a lot of oil fields around Worland, so the firefighters know how to deal with sulfur dioxide. \nAs for the viral video, Kocher says he was surprised to see all the media attention. You don\u2019t see a bluish blazing field every day, and that\u2019s probably what got people hooked. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see how far the video has traveled,\u201d he says.\n\n\n"}
