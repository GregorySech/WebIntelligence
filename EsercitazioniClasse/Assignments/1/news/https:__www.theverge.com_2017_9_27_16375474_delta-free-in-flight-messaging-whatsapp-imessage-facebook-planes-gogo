{"title": "Delta is adding free in-flight messaging \u2014 with a catch", "content": " \nDelta Air Lines announced today that it will be offering free access to in-flight internet for customers to access iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger on any flight with Gogo Wi-Fi starting October 1st, via 9to5Mac. \nThere is a catch, though: when the company says \u201cmessaging,\u201d they mean \u201ctext messaging\u201d \u2014 so no pictures, videos, GIFs, or audio messages allowed. \nStill, considering Delta used to price in-flight messaging starting at $2.95 (prices varied depending on your flight), the new service is a nice change, even if it is limited to boring, text-based messaging. And if you\u2019re willing to shell out for the full Wi-Fi pass, you\u2019ll be able to send the full range of telecommunication messages again, too. \n"}
