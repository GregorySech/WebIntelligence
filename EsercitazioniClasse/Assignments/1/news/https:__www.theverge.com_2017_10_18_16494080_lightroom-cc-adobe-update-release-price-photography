{"content": " Adobe\u2019s best photography management and editing app is evolving in a big way today. The company announced an all-new cloud-connected version of Lightroom with a more approachable look and feel, and a deep connection to the mobile app that will let you progressively edit a photo in near real time across multiple devices. It\u2019s called Lightroom CC, a reference to the company\u2019s Creative Cloud subscription service launched in 2012.Lightroom CC is going to be available a few ways, all starting today. It can be purchased on a standalone $10 per month subscription, which comes with 1 terabyte of cloud storage. This is the option Adobe expects most new users, or ones who don\u2019t need access to Adobe\u2019s other programs  like Photoshop or Bridge , to select. Adobe is also adding it to the current Creative Cloud photography subscription plan  which does include Photoshop, Bridge, and the current version of Lightroom  with 20GB of storage. And if those users want to upgrade to the full terabyte cloud backup option, they\u2019ll only have to pay $5 more a month. There are a few more plans available on Adobe\u2019s website. Even Adobe admits the new naming structure is confusingPhotographers who love  or love to hate  the existing version of Lightroom won\u2019t lose that app. Instead, it\u2019s being rebranded to Lightroom Classic CC. It\u2019s also getting some updates today, like faster boot speed, file imports, and image previews, and some better masking tools. Adobe understands that many photographers are too deeply tied to the workflow, file system, and look and feel of the \u201cold\u201d Lightroom, so it isn\u2019t going to just pull the rug out from underneath them. Lastly, Photoshop CC is getting an update as well, with better connection to the cloud backend, added support for HEIF format images, 360 panorama workflows, and more. Lightroom Classic CC will keep the square logo, while the new Lightroom CC\u2019s has rounded corners and is slightly bluer. A quick recap, because those naming choices are quite confusing: there\u2019s a new, cloud-connected version of Lightroom that\u2019s cleaner, easier to use, and syncs edits across devices called Lightroom CC. The old version of Lightroom stays mostly the same and will be called Lightroom Classic CC. But Photoshop CC, while remaining mostly the same like Lightroom Classic CC, won\u2019t get the \u201cClassic\u201d designation, since Adobe\u2019s not creating a new, second version of the app. Got it? Whether or not you do  and it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t; even Adobe admits \u201cthere will be some confusion\u201d , we should talk more about the actual new version of Lightroom, Lightroom CC. Tom Hogarty, the director of product management for Adobe\u2019s digital imaging team, told me that he believes Lightroom CC \u201cis even a bigger deal than when we created Lightroom in the first place.\u201d That\u2019s a bold statement. Especially since Apple discontinued Aperture, and arguably before that depending on your allegiances, Lightroom has been the best go-to, all-in-one suite for editing and managing digital photos.The crazy thing, though, is Hogarty could be right. And that\u2019s because Lightroom CC is basically the thing that everyone\u2019s expected Adobe would do since it moved to a subscription model and added cloud support a few years ago. It lets you load in a bunch of photos  RAW, JPEG, or whatever , start editing, and then \u2014 once they\u2019re synced to the cloud \u2014 pick up those edits anywhere else. Lightroom CC \u201cis even a bigger deal than when we created Lightroom in the first place\u201dSay you edit some RAW photos at home, and then you head out for the afternoon. But not long after you leave, you realize you\u2019re unhappy with the way you left those edits. With Lightroom CC, you can now just open up the mobile app and continue to tweak those same RAW files to your heart\u2019s content. The adjustments you made should already be showing when you pull up the photo, down to the position of the sliders for each individual tool.  A closeup of the new left rail, which cleans up the folder / file tree system and makes it easier to sort and view all your images.Or maybe you\u2019re more time crunched than fussy. You want to keep editing at your office, but don\u2019t want to lug a bunch of hard drives around. Now you can just pick up where you left off on the desktop  or web app  client at your work computer.Adobe offered the ability to sync libraries of images across different devices using the cloud before, but it was a much fussier process that forced users to actively section off and sync \u201ccollections.\u201d Lightroom CC is much more passive. It does all the work in the background of backing up and syncing images so that you have the same access to them wherever you go. The real power comes from the ability to sync edits across those devices, because it happens in almost real time, at least on the beta version I\u2019ve been testing for the last few days. After all, Hogarty says, \u201cit's just text instructions going back and forth\u201d to these editing clients. Once the files are backed up in the cloud, syncing the edits should be easy and shouldn\u2019t require heavy bandwidth.I have to say, as a former Lightroom power user who\u2019s fallen out of love with the effort it often requires, this is absolutely the kind of thing that could pull me back in. The ability to always have access to the most current edits I\u2019ve made to a set of RAW files, no matter where I go, is aggressively compelling. And it helps solve a problem I\u2019ve had lately, which is an inability to choose between  or, frankly, care about  mobile editing apps. The Lightroom mobile app has come a long way from the rough first attempt Adobe rolled out a few years ago, and it offers plenty of control for the kind of editing experience I want out of a smartphone or tablet. Hogarty says the idea with Lightroom CC is to have \u201cidentical image adjustment tools available on all platforms,\u201d which sounds like music to my ears, as long as the execution\u2019s there \u2014 and it seems like it is.As for the desktop experience of Lightroom CC, there\u2019s a much higher emphasis on putting the photos front and center. The file tree on the left side has shrunk and been simplified, and Adobe  drumroll  has made it so that you can move folders around without totally breaking that system in the app. That alone could be worth the upgrade. The tools on the right rail have been streamlined, too. Most of them are still here, some are just tucked away behind dropdown menus. I am certain many folks won\u2019t initially like the glossier, and frankly more \u201cmobile\u201d look that dominates Lightroom CC, but most all the same controls are still here. Some, like the \u201cradius\u201d and \u201cdetail\u201d sliders under the Sharpening tool, have been hidden behind little triangle drop downs, so it will take a while to reorient yourself. \u201cAll the controls are there, it\u2019s just that by default we're not overwhelming you,\u201d Hogarty says. A few are missing, like split toning and tone curve. \u201cWe think it's a pretty good first start, and we want to do some innovations around the user experience of\u201d options like tone curve, he adds. Many of the default shortcuts are different, too, including basics like the one for the Crop tool  which is now \u201cC,\u201d not \u201cR,\u201d which I totally understand but will take me weeks to train my brain around , as well as more granular ones like how you copy the style of one photo to others.  It\u2019s now simply a mix of Command + C and Command + V, which again, makes sense, but will take some time.  Building the power of Adobe\u2019s cloud services into the new version of Lightroom opens up opportunities for new ideas, too. One of those is that Lightroom CC is getting AI-generated auto-tagging, and therefore will offer a Google Photos-like keyword search at launch. This way, if you download a menagerie of photos from your SD card that were shot across multiple times and spaces, you should be able to just instantly search for \u201cconcert\u201d or \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201csunset\u201d  or \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201csunset\u201d  and find the photos you want. It\u2019s a little slow in the beta I\u2019ve had, but it\u2019s a good idea that will hopefully get even faster and smarter over time. And it\u2019s a hint of the types of new ideas Adobe wants to slowly introduce to the mix from its bag of cloud and AI tricks, a suite of technologies the company broadly refers to as \u201cSensei.\u201d  One other thing coming: the ability for Lightroom CC to automatically show you the \u201cbest\u201d photos you took based on sharpness, color, and other factors, and it will show you fewer duplicates. Best of all, there\u2019s a slider in this view, so that if you feel the AI is showing you too much or too little, you can simply adjust until you\u2019re comfortable that it\u2019s not hiding a gem or two.  The new version of Lightroom uses AI to let you search your photos even if they haven\u2019t been tagged.Overall, as loopy as some of the name changes sound, I think this evolution is genuinely for the better. Lightroom CC is what the Lightroom experience should have been for the last few years. As long as Adobe took that time to make sure it got this right, it will have been worth it to have a full library of your images accessible and editable anywhere. If you don\u2019t want to mess with Adobe\u2019s insistence on cloud storage and syncing, you can stick with regular old Lightroom. You just have to live with a new name \u2014 but you at least get a few well-needed upgrades, and Hogarty says his team has \u201ca pretty healthy backlog\u201d of other ones waiting in the wings for 2018.Of course, in the time it took Adobe to get this \u201cLightroom everywhere\u201d idea out the door, companies like Google and Apple have built their own versions of cloud-connected photo services. There will always be photographers who are so married to Lightroom that the option of switching to, say, Apple\u2019s combination of Photos and iCloud isn\u2019t even on the table. It will be up to Lightroom CC to convince the rest of the world\u2019s photographers that Adobe\u2019s way is best. As for Lightroom 6 \u2014 the last remaining standalone version of Lightroom to be released completely outside of the Creative Cloud ecosystem \u2014 here\u2019s what Adobe has to say:  Lightroom 6 is the last stand-alone version of Lightroom that can be purchased outside of a Creative Cloud membership. There will not be a Lightroom 7 perpetual offering. Lightroom 6 will remain for sale for an undetermined amount of time, but will no longer be updated with camera support or bug fixes after the end of 2017. Lightroom 6.13 with support for the Nikon D850 will be released on October 26th, 2017. Try as it might, Adobe will never be able please everyone.
