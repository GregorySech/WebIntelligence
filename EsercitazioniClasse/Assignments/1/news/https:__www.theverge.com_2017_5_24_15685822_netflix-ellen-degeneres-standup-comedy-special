{"title": "Netflix is bringing Ellen DeGeneres back to standup", "content": " \nNetflix is becoming a comedy juggernaut, showing just how much the network has grown compared to its competition. Variety reports that the company is working with Ellen DeGeneres for a standup special. The effort would be DeGeneres\u2019 first special in 15 years, and adds fuel to the argument that Netflix is now the new go-to for top-tier comics.\n\u201cIt has been 15 years since I did a stand-up special. 15 years,\u201d DeGeneres said in an official statement. \u201cAnd I\u2019m writing it now, I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ll keep you posted when and where I\u2019m gonna shoot my Netflix special. I\u2019m excited to do it; I\u2019m excited for you to see it.\u201d\nToday\u2019s announcement was teased by two cryptic tweets sent earlier this afternoon:\n\n\nLooks like it's been 15 years since you did a stand-up special, @TheEllenShow. How about one for Netflix?\u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) May 24, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me think about it. Ok I'm in. https://t.co/kUAdHyXAjS\u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) May 24, 2017\n\n\n\nDeadline assumes that deal for the special is in the $40 million range, roughly the same amount paid out to major stars Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Jerry Seinfeld.\nNetflix wants to grow bigger and faster than the competition\nThat DeGeneres is returning to standup comedy at all is significant. Her last special was HBO\u2019s Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now, which aired in 2003 and earned multiple Emmy nominations. Since then, the comedian has worked on her award-winning daytime talk show and done voice-acting for Pixar\u2019s Finding Nemo and Finding Dory.\nHowever, Netflix is clearly bullish on working with top comedy talent, announcing special after special at a stunning pace. In addition to the likes of Rock and Seinfeld, the company recently released specials for Louis C.K. and The Daily Show\u2019s Hasan Minhaj. And at a time when it\u2019s betting big on bigger and riskier projects, like Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Okja, working with Ellen DeGeneres shows Netflix looking to grow bigger and faster than its competition.\n"}
