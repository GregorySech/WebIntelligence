{"title": "This building uses emoji cast in concrete as modern gargoyles", "content": " \nEmoji are going to be some of the most recognizable icons of the 21st century, says architect Changiz Tehrani, which is why he decided to cast 22 of them in concrete and use them as decoration for a building in the Dutch city of Amersfoort. \n\u201cIn classical architecture they used heads of the king or whatever, and they put that on the fa\u00e7ade,\u201d Tehrani told The Verge. \u201cSo we were thinking, what can we use as an ornament so when you look at this building in 10 or 20 years you can say \u2018hey this is from that year!\u2019\u201d The answer was obvious: emoji. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 22 emoji in total, all cast in concrete. \nImage: Attika Architekten / Bart van Hoek\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey only appear on one side of the building in Vathorst, Amersfoort. The building houses shops on the bottom floor, and flats in the floors above. \nImage: Attika Architekten / Bart van Hoek\n\n\nThe end effect is actually pretty subtle. The building is built around the lines of a grid, with pillars of brick, beams of white concrete, and decorative circles at the intersections. The emoji only appear one one side of the building, which faces into a town square constructed around a 150-year-old oak. The building itself is mixed-use, with shops on the ground floor and flats above; while the rest of the square is home to a library, a theater, and a school \u2014 another reason for using emoji. \n\u201cemoji is a thing of now.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these young people there, and emoji is a thing of now,\u201d says Tehrani, who works for the Dutch firm Attika Architekten. \u201cThe students sit in the square and have lunch and they take pictures. They like it. And with our architecture we always like to put in small details that makes the project a little bit more than a boring building.\u201d \nThe design for each emoji was taken from the template used by WhatsApp, and converted by Attika into a 3D model. These were then sent to the building company involved in the project, which created molds for the emoji and cast them in concrete. Only faces were chosen as they were the most expressive and recognizable emoji. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitect Changiz Tehrani poses with one of the concrete emoji. \nImage: Attika Architekten\n\n\nConstruction on the building finished in 2015, but commercial occupation only began last summer, with official pictures published last month. The reaction has been uniformly positive, says Tehrani, though he admits he never asked older residents of Amersfoort what they thought of the construction. \u201cI don\u2019t know if older people recognize the emoji,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you have a smartphone, you will have seen them.\u201d \nCritics might say that using emoji in architecture is a gimmick that will soon show its age, but Tehrani says that\u2019s precisely why the project is interesting. \u201cIf you look at history, people always think \u2018Oh this is timeless,\u2019 or \u2018This will stay forever,\u2019 and they\u2019re always wrong.\u201d Better, he says, to accept that aiming for architectural immortality is impossible, and have fun embracing what\u2019s truly contemporary. \u201cIt\u2019s like with Facebook. Facebook used to be cool and now it\u2019s just for older people. So maybe we won\u2019t use emoji in 10 years \u2014 that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s still from our time.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents from a nearby school regularly take pictures of the emoji, says Tehrani. \nImage: Attika Architekten / Bart van Hoek\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe building forms one side of a square built around a 150-year-old oak tree. \n\n\n"}
