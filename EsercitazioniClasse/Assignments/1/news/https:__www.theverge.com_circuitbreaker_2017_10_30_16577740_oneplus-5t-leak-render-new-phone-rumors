OnePlus hasn\u2019t confirmed anything about the rumored phone yet.\nA leaked photo of the OnePlus 5T is circulating online, showing a nearly edge-to-edge screen with slim bezels. The leak is a render of the top half of the OnePlus 5T, tweeted out by Evan Blass of Venture Beat. From the image, the phone appears to have 2.5D curved glass, similar to the iPhone 8.\nAccording to an earlier leak from GizChina, the OnePlus 5T will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, an Adreno 540 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 20MP front and rear camera. The rumored 6-inch screen will reportedly have a 1080 x 2160 resolution. A tweet from OnePlus\u2019s CEO from three days ago sparked rumors that the OnePlus 5T might have an AMOLED display from Samsung. That makes sense, since the OnePlus 5 had a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen.\n\n\nTop-half of OnePlus 5T (2.5t?
