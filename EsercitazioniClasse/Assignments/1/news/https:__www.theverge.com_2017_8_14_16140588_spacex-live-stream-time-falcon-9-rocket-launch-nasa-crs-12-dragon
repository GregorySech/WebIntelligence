{"title": "Watch SpaceX launch its Falcon 9 rocket to the space station after a month-long break", "content": " \nAfter a month-long break from spaceflight, SpaceX will attempt to launch one of its Falcon 9 rockets to the International Space Station this afternoon. The rocket is set to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, sending cargo and science experiments to the six astronauts currently living in space. And as per usual, SpaceX plans to land the majority of the Falcon 9 back on solid ground after take off.  \nThis launch marks SpaceX\u2019s 12th cargo resupply mission for NASA and its 11th rocket launch of 2017. SpaceX has been ramping up its launch cadence this year but has been on a hiatus for the majority of July. The break was partially prompted by a temporary closure for maintenance of the Eastern Range \u2014 the areas on the US East Coast that support rocket launches. The range includes Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nthe company\u2019s 11th rocket launch of 2017\nThat maintenance was completed on July 18th, according to NASA Spaceflight, and now the Florida launch sites are prepping for a busy month ahead. The first mission out of the East Coast was supposed to be the launch of a NASA communications satellite, TDRS-M, on top of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas V rocket. It was originally scheduled for August 3rd, but was postponed to August 18th after an antenna on the vehicle broke and had to be replaced. Once TDRS-M launches, one of Orbital ATK\u2019s Minotaur rockets is scheduled to fly from Florida later this month.\n\nBut first up is today\u2019s resupply mission: SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 will be lofting the company\u2019s Dragon cargo capsule, filled with more than 6,400 pounds of cargo and experiments. Those include a supercomputer from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, as well as an experiment to measure cosmic ray particles in space, called Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass, or ISS-CREAM (as NASA calls it). In keeping with that theme, the Dragon will also have extra frozen ice cream on board for the astronauts, according to NASA.\nToday\u2019s flight is scheduled to get off the ground at 12:31PM ET\nToday\u2019s flight is scheduled to get off the ground at 12:31PM ET from the pad at LC39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. It\u2019s an instantaneous launch window, so SpaceX has only one shot to get this Falcon 9 into space. If it does launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 \u2014 the 14-story core of the rocket that contains the main engines and most of the fuel \u2014 will separate from the rest of the vehicle and attempt to land back on Earth about 10 minutes after launch. This time, the rocket\u2019s target is Landing Zone 1, SpaceX\u2019s landing pad at Cape Canaveral. So far, SpaceX has successfully landed all of its rockets that have attempted ground landings there.\nAfter launch, the Dragon is slated to rendezvous with the space station on Wednesday. It\u2019ll then stay docked to the ISS for about a month, before returning to Earth with more than 3,000 pounds of samples and other cargo that need to get back to the ground.\nIf SpaceX doesn\u2019t fly today, however, the launch will have to slip to around August 19th or 20th. That\u2019s because the Russian cosmonauts have a planned spacewalk on Thursday, which could conflict with the Dragon meeting up with the station. So far, weather is looking okay, with a 70 percent chance that conditions will be favorable for a flight. Check back here at 12PM ET to watch NASA and SpaceX\u2019s coverage of the launch live.\n"}
