{"title": "Scientists create invisible ink activated by salt", "content": " Scientists have created a new form of invisible ink, but it has one big hitch: it might be toxic. Invisible inks, or \u201csmart inks,\u201d can be used for everything from preventing counterfeit money to simply storing information. These inks are supposed to be invisible unless activated by light or heat, but in practice, you can usually still see a little bit of what\u2019s written with the ink. In a study published today in Nature Communications, scientists created an ink that is truly invisible \u2014 until you add salt. The new material isn\u2019t perfect: the base compound is lead, which is toxic in large doses. But the scientists are trying to design a safer alternative, study author Liang Li, an engineer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, told The Verge in an email. This lead-based compound can\u2019t be seen. But once you add a special type of salt, the lead turns into nanocrystals that glow when you shine a UV lamp on the paper. Once you reapply the salt, the ink becomes invisible again, so the message can be kept secret and passed along again. This particular technique probably won\u2019t be widely used, but it\u2019s a step closer toward better security for important messages \u2014 or maybe just passing notes in class. "}
