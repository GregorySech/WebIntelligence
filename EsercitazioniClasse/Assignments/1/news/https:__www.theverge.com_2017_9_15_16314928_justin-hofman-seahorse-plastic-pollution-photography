{"title": "How a photographer snapped this tragic photo of a seahorse lugging a Q-tip", "content": " \nWhen nature photographer Justin Hofman was out snorkeling off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumbawa last year, he didn\u2019t know he was going to stumble upon what could be the poster child for today\u2019s marine trash crisis: a tiny seahorse latching onto a cotton swab. \nThe photo, which Hofman posted on Instagram, is now a finalist in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition from the Natural History Museum in London. In the post, Hofman said he wishes the photo didn\u2019t exist. \u201cI wish that this scene didn\u2019t happen every day, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cI spend a lot of time underwater all over the world, and I see trash and debris and human waste all over the place.\u201d \n\n  \n  It\u2019s a photo that I wish didn\u2019t exist but now that it does I want everyone to see it. What started as an opportunity to photograph a cute little sea horse turned into one of frustration and sadness as the incoming tide brought with it countless pieces of trash and sewage. This sea horse drifts long with the trash day in and day out as it rides the currents that flow along the Indonesian archipelago. This photo serves as an allegory for the current and future state of our oceans. What sort of future are we creating? How can your actions shape our planet?\u2028.\u2028thanks to @eyosexpeditions for getting me there and to @nhm_wpy and @sea_legacy for getting this photo in front of as many eyes as possible. Go to @sea_legacy to see how you can make a difference. . #plastic #seahorse #wpy53 #wildlifephotography #conservation @nhm_wpy @noaadebris A post shared by Justin Hofman (@justinhofman) on Sep 12, 2017 at 8:28am PDT\n\n\n\nHofman says he\u2019s been passionate about the problem of marine plastic pollution for a long time. He\u2019s based in Monterey, California, but he\u2019s an expedition leader for a company that takes people all over the world on wild tours. And he\u2019s always talked to people about wildlife and conservation issues. Entering the photography competition has been a way to allow \u201ca larger audience to come into the conversation I\u2019ve been having for years,\u201d he tells The Verge.\nThe seahorse in Hofman\u2019s photo is just one example of how marine animals interact with plastic debris. Every year, tons and tons of plastic trash enters the ocean \u2014 shredding into pieces that are found virtually everywhere, from the surface to the bottom of the sea and on remote islands. Plastic pollution is dangerous for marine animals: birds and fish can die from ingesting too much plastic, and larger animals like whales and sharks can get tangled in fish nets and die. Some estimates say that by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the sea.\nHofman was in Indonesia for one of his expeditions. As he was snorkeling, the tide changed, he says, and the water started filling with all kind of debris \u2014 algae and wood first, then plastic. The tiny seahorse \u2014 about 1.5 inch tall, he says, \u2014 first latched onto a piece of grass, but then got ahold of the Q-tip. \u201cIf you look at the picture, there are actually some white blobs in the background. And those white blobs are actually plastic bags,\u201d Hofman says. \u201cThere was a lot of trash. It was actually disgusting. The water started to smell.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a lot of trash. It was actually disgusting. The water started to smell.\u201d\nTaking the photo, with his Sony a7R II in Nauticam housing, was a moment of serendipity: Hofman had the wrong lens with him \u2014 a 16 to 35 millimeter wide angle lens. The seahorse was so tiny that a macro lens would have been better. But as the tide was moving around, and the seahorse was bouncing, the wide angle lens actually came as an advantage. It allowed Hofman to more easily frame the seahorse in the picture. \u201cI never would have been able to get this thing framed with a macro lens,\u201d he says.\nThe photo has gotten so much attention because it attracts and repulses people at the same time, Hofman says. The seahorse is cute, but it\u2019s latching onto a Q-tip that reminds us of our footprint on the planet. The 33-year-old says he submitted the photo to the competition because he wanted \u201cto get the biggest audience possible.\u201d Winners will be announced next month, but he doesn\u2019t care whether the photo wins. He\u2019s not going to submit it to other competitions. \u201cIt\u2019s accomplished what I wanted to do,\u201d Hofman says. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the accolades.\u201d \nAs a nature photographer, Hofman almost always shoots wildlife or under water. Lately, his work has become more conservation themed, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing more changes as I travel further and further,\u201d Hofman says. \u201cAnd I realize that the message needs to get out to the people who don\u2019t have a chance to go there. I have to be their representative.\u201d\n"}
