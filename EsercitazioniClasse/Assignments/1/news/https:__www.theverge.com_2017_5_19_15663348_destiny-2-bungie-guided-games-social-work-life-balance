{"title": "Bungie is designing Destiny 2 to be a social hobby, not a second job", "content": " \nIf there\u2019s anything Bungie wants you to know about Destiny 2 \u2014 a sequel to the addictive, ambitious, and oftentimes frustrating online-only shooter \u2014 it\u2019s that the game will actually respect your time. During the first gameplay reveal in Los Angeles yesterday, Bungie executives took the stage to outline the substantial quality of life improvements the sequel will introduce to make this happen. \nFrom removing the need to load in and out of one area for different activities to letting players more easily group up with strangers, Bungie is going to great lengths to paint its new installment as a more thoughtful, well-meaning, and accessible video game. \u201cWe want Destiny to not feel like work and feel like it\u2019s taking up your life,\u201d says M.E. Chung, a game designer at Bungie who specializes on the series\u2019 social dynamics. \u201cWe want it to fit into your life schedule.\u201d\n\u201cWe want Destiny to not feel like work.\u201d\nFor many hardcore players, the original Destiny sometimes felt like a second job. On top of the grind of daily play and the ever-increasing amount of items to collect, Destiny was hobbled by befuddling design choices and maddening technical constraints. Players complained endlessly about not having enough space for all their gear and weapons, the lack of narrative and cinematic direction, and an almost Kafkaesque progression system. (Ask any longtime player and they can recount horror stories of repetitive materials farming and the nihilistic cruelty of the game\u2019s random number generator.) Destiny spent its first year looking like an extended beta, as Bungie tweaked and changed it constantly in response to player feedback.\nThe end result was a title that reminded players that their time just might be better spent elsewhere, creating a constant tug-of-war battle between that nagging feeling and the satisfying, dopamine rush of another new piece of loot or a hard-fought victory. For those without a dedicated group of friends to play with, Destiny could feel like an alienating and isolated experience. With all the the window dressing of its social infrastructure stripped away, it was just a series of feedback loops and feeble reward systems laid bare \u2014 a pretty-looking gun game with nothing to say. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Bungie\n\n\nThe original Destiny, which could cost upwards of $150 when you factor in expansions and other add-on content, was a fascinating attempt at trying to blend the benefits of a massively multiplayer online game with the nuts and bolts of a first-person shooter. The combination was both a wondrous success and spectacular failure on multiple levels. Even the most diehard players are quick to own up to their complicated relationship with the game. Yet while fans may have endured an emotional rollercoaster of a relationship with Destiny\u2019s creators over the years, the franchise has come out on the other end intact. \nNow, Bungie is ready for its second shot. The developer wants Destiny 2 to feel like a fresher, friendlier, and more social game, everything the original was meant to be. \u201cWe have a saying, \u2018Making it easier to find the fun,\u2019\u201d says Chung. Bungie hopes this extends through every element of the game. The goal is to make Destiny 2 less of a slog designed only for the most dedicated of players, while also being more accessible to people who don\u2019t have a large network of online friends to play with. \u201cThere are some people who are going to play every day \u2014 one of our lessons is that our players are always going to outpace us,\u201d Chung admits. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want players to fall behind.\u201d\nGuided Games will help solo players team up with larger groups\nThis new philosophy appears to have had the biggest impact on the game\u2019s social elements. Destiny 2 will now feature a system called Guided Games, which will let less experienced players opt to play with more skilled members of an official clan. (These clans existed in a minor form in the previous game, through the company\u2019s website, but never as a fully functioning in-game system.) \nOne of the biggest problems with the initial Destiny was how many of its most challenging and rewarding activities were restricted to premade teams, meaning you couldn\u2019t go in solo and find other strangers to play with. Instead, players formed groups through third-party forums on Reddit, and scores of dedicated Destiny group-finding services popped up elsewhere. Now, players will be able to jump into group activities by selecting a clan that meets their criteria, whether it be a kid-friendly group, one that\u2019s more competitive, one open to female players, or any number of other possibilities. \nChung says the original restrictions in Destiny were an intentional design decision, something Bungie felt was necessary given the toxicity of the game community. The developer didn\u2019t feel comfortable putting strangers into high-stress situations, especially when it could be a young kid and a profanity-loving college student. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. You hear about toxicity in lots of different games [today],\u201d she says. \u201cI played online games in my teens and it was just as toxic then,\u201d just with less female players, she adds. Chung says that, as a female gamer, she learned to play without a mic and by using only ambiguous online handles that wouldn\u2019t give away her gender. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Bungie\n\n\nIt was this kind of toxicity, coupled with how wonky and unfriendly old-school PC server lists were, that moved console shooters toward matchmaking, Chung explains, where you could easily queue into a playlist and choose never to interact with others if you didn\u2019t want to. But that \u201cmade you lose the ability to find the people you trust\u201d to play with, she says. Bungie is now trying to find a better balance, after deciding that its initial approach in the first Destiny simply did not work. \nGuided Games will hopefully be that system, letting players enjoy features like the six-person raids and three-person \u201cnightfall\u201d strikes by self-selecting a group to be paired with. Of course, the success of this will all depend on how willing clans are to help strangers and take their roles seriously, and whether the logistical and technical challenges involved don\u2019t mean enduring long wait times to find strangers to play with. Bungie says there will be reward systems for clans to help incentivize positivity and openness, but the developer has yet to disclose details on how the system will work. \n\u201cWe had a hunch about this game being about the community.\u201d\nChung says that, above all, Destiny 2 is aimed at nurturing the series\u2019 tight-knit community. \u201cWe had a hunch about this game being about the community,\u201d she says. Prior to release, Bungie had no idea the Destiny would inspire a 300,000-plus subreddit or real-life meet-ups or dedicated cosplay. That\u2019s not to mention the scores of personal stories about friendships made, family bonds strengthened, and even an in-game marriage proposal. Now \u2014 three years later and with a legion of fans who play Destiny as devoutly as some of the longest-running MMOs \u2014 it seems clear that without its social fabric, the game would be just another flashy shooter. \nDestiny\u2019s entire purpose, Chung adds, is to create virtual obstacles for players to overcome together. \u201cI describe that challenge as the fuel to memories between lifelong friends. I think a lot about games I\u2019ve been playing, when you ask yourself, \u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d she says, ruminating on the hours we spend obsessively collecting virtual goods and toiling away online to blow off steam. \u201cWe hope with Destiny they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m spending time with my friends.\u2019 Most people don\u2019t regret the time they spend with their friends.\u201d\n"}
