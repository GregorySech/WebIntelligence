{"title": "Lewis Tan and the awkward case of what Iron Fist could have been", "content": " \nMuch has been said about the casting problems in Iron Fist, a show centered around the trope of a Western white man adapting the practices of a mystical Eastern society. Danny Rand, in keeping true to the character\u2019s original appearance, is played by blonde-haired, blue-eyed Finn Jones. \nBut in casting the show\u2019s lead, Marvel did consider other actors, including Lewis Tan. The half-Chinese actor and son of award-winning martial artist and stunt coordinator Philip Tan was eventually cast as a villain \u2014 a drunk fighter who has one scene in the 13-hour series. \nVulture has an interview with the actor, who outlines the possibilities of playing Iron Fist \u2014 a character who is defined by being an outsider \u2014 in a particularly heartbreaking way. \u201cThere\u2019s no more of an outsider than an Asian-American: We feel like outsiders in Asia, and we feel like outsiders at home,\u201d he told the site. He points to casting calls, where he\u2019s dissected as being a six-foot-two, 180 pound, \u201cmuscular half-Asian\u201d that no one quite knows what to do with. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been dealing with my whole life. So I understand those frustrations of being an outsider. Like Danny\u2019s character. I understand him very well.\u201d \n\u201cI understand those frustrations of being an outsider\u201d\nTan\u2019s presence would have changed the role in a compelling way. As he puts it, \u201cit would have been a really interesting dynamic to see this Asian-American guy who\u2019s not in touch with his Asian roots go and get in touch with them and discover this power.\u201d Instead of reusing the same tired \u201cfish out of water\u201d narrative that appropriates an often misconstrued culture, Iron Fist could have provided a fresh, much needed perspective. \nNetflix released Iron Fist on March 17th. The show has been widely panned by critics; it currently holds a 17 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Theorizing that the show might have been more successful with a different lead is an alluring fantasy, if not at least an interesting thought experiment.\nLewis Tan might have made a phenomenal Iron Fist. All we know for sure is that Finn Jones did not. \n \n\n\n\n\n"}
