{"title": "\u2018Sheeple\u2019 is now in the dictionary, and Apple users are the example", "content": " \nJust when you though the mobile operating system flame wars of yesteryear had at last subsided, think again. This morning, Merriam-Webster gleefully tweeted a new addition to its online dictionary: \u201csheeple,\u201d or \u201cpeople who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced.\u201d You might not immediately draw a connection to one particular proclivity over another, but Merriam-Webster takes the liberty of quoting CNN technology columnist Doug Criss. \n\u201cApple's debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone \u2014 an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for,\u201d the example reads. It\u2019s from a 2015 news roundup Criss published on CNN\u2019s website, which Merriam-Webster seems to point to as a prime example of the popular modern-day use of the term. Sheeple dates back to 1945, according to the dictionary entry, most likely as a derogatory term for helpless followers of consumer trends of the time. Nowadays, however, it\u2019s more likely to poke fun at blind followers of the iPhone maker. \nYou\u2019d think that characterization might not irk your average Apple fanboy \u2014 another  Merriam-Webster term \u2014 these days if not for the the company\u2019s rather peculiar product mishaps and design misfires over the last couple of years. As Criss pointed out at the time, there\u2019s the bulging and ugly iPhone battery case. Yet there\u2019s also the mouse that can only be charged upside down and the Apple Pencil stylus that regains power from the Lightning port of an iPad. \n\n\napple's 2015 lineup is looking great pic.twitter.com/302S7jstSp\u2014 Owen \u26a1\ufe0f (@ow) December 8, 2015\n\n\n\nMore recently, we have the $159 wireless AirPod headphones that can fall out of yours ears and the 5K UltraFine monitor made in partnership with LG that didn\u2019t play nice with routers. Oh, and how could we forget the unceremonious removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. \nApple design isn\u2019t quite what it used to be, it seems, and yet the company keeps posting record sales. So while we haven\u2019t had a good iPhone vs. Android or Mac vs. PC debate in a while, maybe we\u2019re overdue for a little flame-stoking. Merriam-Webster seems to think so. \nCorrection: A previous version of this article mistakenly cited the price of AirPods at $180. The wireless earbuds are in fact $159. \n"}
