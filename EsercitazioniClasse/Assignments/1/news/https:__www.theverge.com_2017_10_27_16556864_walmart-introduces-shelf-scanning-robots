{"title": "Walmart is using shelf-scanning robots to audit its stores", "content": " Robots are already a common sight in warehouses  Amazon alone use more than 45,000  but now they\u2019re moving into stores too. Walmart has announced it\u2019s deploying shelf-scanning bots in 50 locations around the US, using the machines to check things like inventory, prices, and misplaced items. The retailing giant says the robots\u2019 introduction won\u2019t lead to job losses, and that the company wants to save employees from carrying out tasks that are \u201crepeatable, predictable, and manual.\u201d The robots themselves are produced by California-based Bossa Nova Robotics, and are about two-feet tall with an extendable tower containing lights and sensors for scanning shelves. They sit in recharging stations in the store until a human employee gives them a \u201cmission\u201d \u2014 e.g. checking a particular aisle to see what needs re-stocking. The robots are supposed to save workers\u2019 time, but Walmart says it will also use the data they collect to improve efficiency nationwide. \"If you think about trying to go through a facility with all these different [items] and figure out if your prices are accurate, it can be very time-consuming,\u201d John Crecelius, Walmart\u2019s vice president of central operations, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. \u201cFrom our perspective, when you're doing things like this you're trying to improve your service to your customers and trying to make things simpler and easier for your associates at the same time.\u201dDemonstrating the robots\u2019 usefulness is simple enough, but Walmart\u2019s claim that their deployment won\u2019t lead to job losses is harder to prove. Just because you don\u2019t fire a human the moment you buy a robot, doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t hire fewer humans further down the line. And although economists and other forecasters disagree about whether the current wave of automation is going to lead to widespread job losses, at least some studies show that when you get more  industrial  robots in any geographic area, you get fewer jobs and lower wages. Whether or not the same holds true of shelf-scanning bots will no doubt be the subject of future studies. "}
