{"title": "Dead Men Tell No Tales proves continuity still doesn't matter for the Pirates of the Caribbean films", "content": " \nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth entry in the swashbuckling film series, and like its four predecessors, it\u2019s packed to the gills with pirates, sea monsters, action, adventure, Johnny Depp doing whatever it is Johnny Depp does, and an egregious disregard for the laws of physics. \nThe film is billed as the \u201cfinal adventure\u201d of Captain Jack Sparrow, though co-director Joachim R\u00f8nning called it the \u201cbeginning of the finale,\u201d and said there might be 10 sequels for all he knows. But even though it is theoretically part of one long, ongoing story, Dead Men Tell No Tales is puzzlingly, irritatingly ignorant of much of the continuity of the series.\n\u2018Dead Men Tell No Tales\u2019 is puzzlingly, irritatingly ignorant of much of the continuity of the series\nThis may seem like the nitpicking of a fan who spent what, in retrospect, may have been too much time watching the first few Pirates movies in middle school. But the complete disregard for the series\u2019s existing canon feels significant. If the whole point of a franchise (at least from a non-monetary perspective) is to give filmmakers room to tell overarching stories and develop characters and plots over time, the Pirates of the Caribbean films have utterly failed. Basic elements of the universe, like Jack\u2019s compass or the Black Pearl, show up in every movie. But their impact is blunted when no one making the films cares about what these elements are supposed to mean. Why should fans care about the latest chapter of a story when the creators themselves don\u2019t? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Disney\n\n\nWarning: major spoilers ahead for all five Pirates films, including Dead Men Tell No Tales\nThe problem doesn\u2019t lie entirely in Dead Men Tell No Tales. The entire continuity of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise makes no sense. That\u2019s largely due to the series\u2019s lurching development.\nThe entire continuity of the \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019 franchise makes no sense\nThe first film, Curse of the Black Pearl, is almost entirely a standalone adventure. Based loosely on the original Disneyland ride, it tells a single, coherent story that wraps up pretty conclusively. Following its blockbuster success, Disney greenlit two more sequels \u2014 Dead Man\u2019s Chest and At World\u2019s End, which were shot back-to-back and written to retroactively graft Curse of the Black Pearl onto the front of what was now a trilogy. As it stands, those two films largely serve as a single, extended story. It\u2019s long, dragging, and increasingly absurd, but it\u2019s still a single unit.\nThat was supposed to be it for the franchise, but after the successful opening weekend of At World\u2019s End, Disney began exploring and developing a fourth film, which turned into the standalone On Stranger Tides, considered by many calculations to be the most expensive movie ever filmed. That feature told a mostly unrelated story, refocusing the spotlight even more squarely on Depp\u2019s Captain Jack Sparrow after Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (who play series stars Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, respectively) declined to sign on for another installment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Disney\n\n\nSo while Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn\u2019t do itself any favors when it comes to keeping the stories of the series straight, its continuity isn\u2019t built on the sturdiest of scaffolding. Throwaway references, like Jack\u2019s run-in with the East India Trading Company or a colloquial mention of Davy Jones\u2019 locker from the first film, get awkwardly built out into major villains in the second and third, then vanish forever. Another example is Blackbeard: he shows up in the fourth film with no explanation about where he was in the previous entries, when the Pirate Lords convened and fought to save piracy.\nDead Men Tell No Tales is weird in that it tries to draw on some of the elements of the previous four films \u2014 something On Stranger Tides notably didn\u2019t do \u2014 like reusing old musical cues, and bringing back Angus Barnett and Giles New as Mullroy and Murtogg, the two recurring British officers who serve as comic relief in the earlier films. And yet it casually rewrites critical aspects of the series\u2019s lore.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nDoes Dead Men Tell No Tales capture the magic of Disney\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean ride?\n\nFor example: Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew are turned into ghost / demon pirates after their ship is wrecked inside the Devil\u2019s Triangle. Why? It\u2019s never explained, and in general, it\u2019s best not to think too carefully about that \u2014 or about literally anything involving their powers, or the rules of their curse. Somehow, Salazar determines that Jack\u2019s magical compass can free him and his crew. But since a flashback shows that Jack receives the compass from his dying captain only minutes before damning Salazar and his crew, it\u2019s not clear why their curse would focus on that. Jack\u2019s compass is an iconic part of the franchise; it famously doesn\u2019t point north, but rather to the thing its holder wants most. And, as Dead Men Tell No Tales informs us, if you \u201cbetray\u201d the compass, it releases your greatest fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Disney\n\n\nover the course of the series, Jack has given away or lost his compass at least five times without activating any curses\nProblem is, in Dead Man\u2019s Chest, we\u2019re told that Jack received the compass from Tia Dalma, the human form of the sea goddess Calypso. And the entire plot of Dead Men Tell No Tales emerges from Jack \u201cbetraying\u201d the compass by trading it for booze. But by my count, Jack has given away or lost his compass over the course of the series at least five times without activating any curses. In Dead Man\u2019s Chest, he gives it to Elizabeth so she can find Davy Jones\u2019 heart and save Will. He loses the compass to Lord Cutler Beckett in At World\u2019s End when he\u2019s captured by the East India Trading company. He gets it back, then gives it to Will before stranding him in the ocean. Beckett gets it from Will and gives it back to Jack later in that same film. Jack lets Blackbeard take it from him during the search for Ponce de Leon\u2019s ship in On Stranger Tides. Blackbeard gives it to his daughter, Angelica, Jack gets it back, and then he gives it to his companion Joshamee Gibbs, who returns it at the end of the film.\nAnother major driving portion of the the latest entry is Henry Turner\u2019s quest to save his father from his cursed service on the Flying Dutchman. It\u2019s a good motivation, except it doesn\u2019t fit the series\u2019s story. As revealed in At World\u2019s End, the Dutchman\u2019s role is to ferry the souls of sailors lost at sea to the afterlife. Calypso, goddess of the sea, assigned the Dutchman to Captain Davy Jones, a sailor who fell in love with her. The deal granted him immortality in exchange for his service, but he could only spend one day on land for every 10 years of service. Jones and his crew only turn into horrific sea-monster people after Jones finds out Calypso has moved on from his love, and abandons his task. After Will is fatally stabbed in At World\u2019s End, Jack saves his life by killing Jones so Will can take over his role. By returning the Dutchman to its traditional duties, he saves the crew and they resume their normal appearance, even in the \u201c10 years later\u201d post-credits sting from At World\u2019s End.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Disney\n\n\nBut in Dead Men Tell No Tales, Will is covered in barnacles on a monstrous-looking Dutchman again, presumably because that looks cooler. His son Henry wants to break his \u201ccurse,\u201d but that curse is an important job that Will chose of his own volition. And if he abandons it, shouldn\u2019t he resume dying of his fatal stab wound?\nHow does any of this fit together in the same world?\nBy the end of Dead Men Tell No Tales, it\u2019s revealed that Poseidon's Trident contains all the curses of the sea within it, and breaking it breaks all curses. This raises some serious questions about the theology of the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. There\u2019s Calypso, the goddess of the sea. There are the Aztec gods who curse the treasure of Cortez in the first movie. Poseidon once existed in some form, and his trident, which literally commands the seas, is found in his tomb. (So gods die in this universe? And if Poseidon was around at some point, what about the other Greek gods?) There\u2019s the magical Sword of Triton, which Blackbeard uses to control his boat in On Stranger Tides. The Fountain of Youth also exists, though it comes with some strangely specific rules. And several different forms of voodoo magic function in this universe, which implies the existence of a whole set of Loa. How does any of this fit together in the same world? I can\u2019t come up with a good answer, and I don\u2019t think anyone else working on these films can either. \nThe series\u2019s timeline is similarly overcrowded and patchworked together, and Dead Men Tell No Tales complicates it further. When Jack Sparrow is young, Salazar destroys dozens of pirate ships in his effort to rid the sea of piracy. By Salazar\u2019s account, he succeeds in this \u2014 killing every pirate except Jack and his crew. But At World\u2019s End establishes that there\u2019s a Brethren Court that governs pirates, and it assembles to protect the pirate way of life when the East India Trade Company threatens to wipe out all the pirates.\nBut World\u2019s End claims the Court is meeting for the first time in Jack\u2019s lifetime. Was Salazar\u2019s massacre not worth their time? Or did all these ancient, venerable pirates somehow come into being after the massacre? On a related note, how old is Jack? He appears to be somewhere in his late teens when he takes command of the Wicked Wench, later renamed the Black Pearl. Prior to the first movie, the Black Pearl is sunk, Davy Jones brings it back from the depths as part of a deal with Jack, and gives him 13 years to captain the ship. During the first two years of that deal, he leads the expedition with Barbossa as first mate to find the treasure of Cortez, and Barbossa betrays him, so Jack spends 10 years seeking revenge. There\u2019s barely enough time in Jack\u2019s timeline for all these events to occur, assuming he\u2019s in his thirties or so during Curse of the Black Pearl. But that would put him at something close to 50 by Dead Men Tell No Tales, given that Henry Turner has yet to be conceived at that point, and he grows up to be 20 before meeting Jack. How long is Jack going to be running around doing this? Depp is 53 himself, and he still seems pretty spry, but the average life expectancy in the 1700s, when the films are roughly set, was between 30 and 40. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Disney\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the post-credits teaser in Dead Men Tell No Tales, which like so many other things, doesn\u2019t make sense within the franchise. The stinger sees Will having a nightmare wherein the tentacle-faced shadow and lobster-clawed hand of Davy Jones come looming over his bed. Then Will wakes up to reveal that it was all a dream\u2026 except the camera pans to the floor to show some sea water and barnacles, hinting at a possible return of the squid-faced villain. But Jones a) is dead as of At World\u2019s End (although the Pirates series has had no problem resurrecting characters before), and b) wouldn\u2019t be a squid-man even if he was alive again, since Will specifically broke the Dutchman\u2019s curse, and then the shattering of Poseidon\u2019s Trident also separately broke all the sea curses. But as with anything else in Pirates continuity, I don\u2019t really think anyone making these films really cares. \nThe whole movie feels cobbled together from elements of earlier \u2018Pirates\u2019 films\nLeaving aside the basic storytelling holes in Dead Men Tell No Tales, the whole movie is tiring because half of it is cobbled together from elements of earlier movies. An island that no man can find? Featured in Curse of the Black Pearl. Undead pirates? See films one, two, and three. MacGuffin leading to command of the sea? Dead Man\u2019s Chest. Antagonist who wants to kill Jack Sparrow because of a personal slight, and can walk through walls, but can\u2019t go on dry land? Dead Man\u2019s Chest and At World\u2019s End. Jack and Barbossa fighting over who gets to captain the Black Pearl? Curse and World\u2019s End. Evil British officer who wants to harness the supernatural thing to wipe out pirates and take command of the oceans? Chest and World\u2019s End again. Henry and Carina, the fresh new faces to head the franchise? Dead Men Tell No Tales isn\u2019t even subtle about trying to re-create the original pairing of Will and Elizabeth all over again. He\u2019s the son of a pirate who lost his father, she\u2019s skeptical of the piratical life but comes around \u2014 sound familiar?\nBut since these films historically make boatloads of money, to the point where even the best pirate would be jealous, Joachim R\u00f8nning is probably right about Disney making 10 more nonsensical sequels, even if it does mean piling up more gods, shoehorning in more miraculously unbroken curses, and replacing Bloom and Knightley with even more lookalikes down the road. We can only hope that whoever helms the ship next actually watches the previous movies first. Although, given the repetitive plot elements in the series so far, maybe it would be best for everyone if things started fresh in a sixth installment. \nCorrection: The Pirates of the Caribbean films are roughly set in the mid 1700s, not the 1400s as this article originally stated.\n"}
