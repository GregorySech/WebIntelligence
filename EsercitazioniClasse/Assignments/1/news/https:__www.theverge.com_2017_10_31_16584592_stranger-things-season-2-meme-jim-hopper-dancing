{"title": "Stranger Things season 2\u2019s meme is Jim Hopper dancing to everything", "content": " \nIn season 1 of Stranger Things, we had #Justice4Barb. This season, we\u2019ve got\u2026 dancing Hopper. Stranger Things season 2 got its first meme this week, as a Twitter account called @hopperdancingto started posting videos of Sheriff Jim Hopper dancing to K-pop, the Stranger Things theme song, the Bag Raiders, and Michael Jackson. \nThe meme really took off when David Harbour, who plays Hopper, tweeted his fervent approval of the account. Now, 17,000 people are following Hopper Dancing To.\n\n\nWhoever created this account has won, not only the internet, but, yes, my stone cold heart.  Thank you @hopperdancingto \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/RCf8dRZfOC\u2014 David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) October 29, 2017\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s too bad the scene is so dimly lit that Hopper and Eleven look gray and washed-out. The clip is taken from Stranger Things season 2, episode 3, \u201cThe Pollywog,\u201d when (spoiler!), a flashback explains how Hopper sheltered Eleven after the events of season 1. Eleven looks on in awe, as Hopper shimmies to the 1972 song \u201cYou Don\u2019t Mess Around With Jim\u201d by Jim Croce. \nIf you didn\u2019t like the show\u2019s song choice, or just want to see Hopper get hyped about music from a different era, you can set the running loop of Hopper dancing to a new song with the hashtag #HopperDancing. Viral memes tend to be open-ended enough that anyone can add their own contributions. This one\u2019s no exception: there are an infinite number of ways to reimagine what Hopper is hearing when he dances.\n\n\nJim Hopper dancing to Barbie Girl #StrangerThings @Stranger_Things @noah_schnapp @milliebbrown @FinnSkata @GatenM123 @calebrmclaughl1 pic.twitter.com/6Gi6FcFL2a\u2014 Hopper Dancing To (@hopperdancingto) October 29, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Hopper dancing to Hips Don't Lie - Shakira #StrangerThings pic.twitter.com/Ev9AtMpXrB\u2014 Hopper Dancing To (@hopperdancingto) October 31, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
