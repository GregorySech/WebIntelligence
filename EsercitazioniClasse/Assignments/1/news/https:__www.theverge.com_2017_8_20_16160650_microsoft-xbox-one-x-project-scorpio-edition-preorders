{"title": "Microsoft's Project Scorpio returns as a special Xbox One X for preorders", "content": " \nMicrosoft first revealed its Xbox One X back at E3, and now it\u2019s allowing consumers to preorder the console today ahead of its release on November 7th. Just like the Xbox One Day One Edition, Microsoft is also creating a special edition for the Xbox One X: the Project Scorpio Edition. Priced at $499, the Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition includes a gradient design on the console itself, alongside the console\u2019s Project Scorpio codename on the controller and console. You can preorder the Xbox One X at the following stores:\n\nAmazon\nMicrosoft\nWalmart\nBest Buy\nTarget\n\nThe retail packaging for this Scorpio Edition even features a giant X that\u2019s reminiscent of the original Xbox. Aside from the graphic pattern on the console and Project Scorpio branding, the changes are purely cosmetic. There\u2019s no little LCD display like the Project Scorpio dev unit, and the hardware inside is identical to a regular Xbox One X. This is purely for fans of the codename and early adopters of the Xbox One X.\nThe Xbox One X is designed to compete with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 Pro, and it\u2019s certainly more powerful at 6 teraflops of graphical power vs. the 4.2 teraflops found on the PS4 Pro. Microsoft is working with third-party games studios to ensure Xbox One titles are optimized for the new power of the Xbox One X. These optimizations will be free to existing owners of games, and more than 100 titles have been confirmed for Xbox One X optimizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXbox One X games will be enhanced for 4K and more\nWhile game makers can\u2019t create titles only for the Xbox One X, they can provide more assets, a higher resolution, and better frame rates on the console. All of these optimizations fall under a new \u201cXbox One X Enhanced\u201d program. The optimizations might not always be clear, but Microsoft is using three logos in total for new Xbox One games. There\u2019s an enhanced logo to indicate a game has been updated for the Xbox One X, and a 4K and HDR logo to note specific support. The 4K indicator simply means a game has a 2160p butter output, but that 4K support will include native, checkerboarding, and dynamic resolution. Microsoft\u2019s HDR support is the regular HDR10 standard that is also used on the Xbox One S, and there\u2019s no word on Dolby Vision support.\nIn terms of launch titles for the Xbox One X, Microsoft just revealed that Crackdown 3 has been delayed to spring next year. That leaves the Xbox One X without a major Xbox-exclusive title on launch day, and Microsoft will have to convince consumers that it\u2019s worth the upgrade for exclusives like Forza Motorsport 7, Cuphead, Super Lucky\u2019s Tale, and the console launch exclusive PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Both Forza 7 and Cuphead are debuting before the Xbox One X, but Super Lucky's Tale will launch at the same time as the Xbox One X on November 7th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re expecting to see Xbox One X improvements for 1080p TVs too\nMicrosoft is focusing on what it calls \u201ctrue 4K\u201d games on Xbox One. While most consumers don\u2019t own a 4K TV yet, Microsoft is promising that games will also run quicker and smoother on 1080p screens. 4K is the big target for the Xbox One X, but hopefully we\u2019ll see devs improve games for 60fps on 1080p TV screens too. \nMicrosoft has priced its Xbox One X at a $100 prime premium over the PS4 Pro. It\u2019s still not clear how many titles will truly hit native 4K at 60fps, and the pricing could prove to be an issue like it was with the original Xbox One vs. PS4. At least this time Microsoft has a lot more raw power to offer for the extra cash. With canceled games and delays to its own games, Microsoft will still need to prove it has titles that will draw consumers to the Xbox One X.\n\n"}
