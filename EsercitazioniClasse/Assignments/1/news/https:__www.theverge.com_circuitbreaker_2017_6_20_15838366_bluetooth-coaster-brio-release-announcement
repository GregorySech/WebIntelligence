{"title": "This connected coaster is a silly solution to keep your drink safe at bars", "content": " \nThe Brio is supposed to do it all. It\u2019s a Bluetooth-connected coaster and a social network. It raises awareness about \u201cdrink safety,\u201d and even has its own mascot \u2014 an owl named Sal. Sal stands for \u201cSecure Alcohol Liaison\u201d and he\u2019s supposed to be your \u201cwingman\u201d by guiding you through Brio\u2019s companion iOS app. I\u2019m not making this up. The app lets you mark your favorite bar establishments and subsequently rate them. You can also apparently find other people using the Brio coaster and maybe meet up with them. I don\u2019t get the product at all.\nHere\u2019s the mascot just so you have a visual:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrio\n\n\nBrio will tell you if someone messes with your drink while you\u2019re in the bathroom, but instead of going by weight changes or some other metric, you have to cover your drink with the coaster. It detects motion. This is far less impressive. The Brio has 24 LED lights built in, too, so you can change how it lights up. I somehow think you won\u2019t be the coolest person in the bar with your own light-up coaster that you brought from home, even if that\u2019s what Brio wants you to think. I can\u2019t hate on the product too much, though, because it\u2019s at least trying to keep people safe, which is a legitimate concern. I only wish Brio created its gadget without simultaneously devising a whole social network around coaster.\nI\u2019m happy to say this coaster isn\u2019t being crowdfunded. No, instead you can buy it right now for $39.99 on Brio\u2019s website. A connected coaster: is this what was missing from your life? \n"}
