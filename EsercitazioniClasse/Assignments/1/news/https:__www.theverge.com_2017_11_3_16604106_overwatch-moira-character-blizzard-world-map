 At BlizzCon today, Blizzard unveiled two big new updates coming to its hero shooter Overwatch. To start, the game will be getting a new character: a mad scientist-type support hero called Moira. There’s no word yet on when she’ll be available to players in the game, but she joins an ever-growing cast that most recently added Doomfist in the summer. You can find out more details about Moira on the Overwatch site.In addition to that, Overwatch is also getting an exciting new map called “Blizzard World.” Essentially, it’s a virtual imagining of what a Blizzard theme park would look like, complete with areas based on games like Hearthstone, StarCraft, and Diablo. Unfortunately, it’ll be a while before you can play it; “Blizzard World” won’t be available until early 2018.Earlier at BlizzCon the company also revealed that iconic strategy game StarCraft II is going free-to-play later this month.
