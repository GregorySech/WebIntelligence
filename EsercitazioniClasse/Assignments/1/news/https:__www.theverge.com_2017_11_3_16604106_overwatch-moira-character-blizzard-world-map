{"content": " \nAt BlizzCon today, Blizzard unveiled two big new updates coming to its hero shooter Overwatch. To start, the game will be getting a new character: a mad scientist-type support hero called Moira. There\u2019s no word yet on when she\u2019ll be available to players in the game, but she joins an ever-growing cast that most recently added Doomfist in the summer. You can find out more details about Moira on the Overwatch site.\n\nIn addition to that, Overwatch is also getting an exciting new map called \u201cBlizzard World.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s a virtual imagining of what a Blizzard theme park would look like, complete with areas based on games like Hearthstone, StarCraft, and Diablo. Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be a while before you can play it; \u201cBlizzard World\u201d won\u2019t be available until early 2018.\nEarlier at BlizzCon the company also revealed that iconic strategy game StarCraft II is going free-to-play later this month.\n", "title": "Overwatch is getting a mad scientist hero and a Blizzard theme park map"}
