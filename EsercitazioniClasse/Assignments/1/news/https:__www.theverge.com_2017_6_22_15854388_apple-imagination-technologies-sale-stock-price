{"title": "After dispute with Apple, chip maker Imagination Technologies puts itself up for sale", "content": " \nImagination Technologies, former chip designer for Apple, has announced today that it\u2019s selling the entire company, initiating a formal sale process.\nIts stock price is climbing rapidly following the news \u2014 the first positive growth it\u2019s seen since Imagination\u2019s fall out with Apple in April. The British-based company said in a press release that several parties had expressed interest in buying them over the past few weeks but \u201cthere can be no certainty that any offer will be made for Imagination.\u201d \nThis all comes just two months after Apple announced it would begin making graphics chip designs in house and cut off its reliance on Imagination within two years. This news dropped Imagination\u2019s stock price to half of where it had been before. In response to the end of its relationship with Apple, which was responsible for a significant portion of Imagination\u2019s revenue, Imagination planned to sell off two of its businesses and begin a formal dispute with Apple over its graphic patents because informal talks weren\u2019t getting them anywhere. Apple making graphics chips in house would infringe on Imagination\u2019s patents, the latter maintained, but Apple wouldn\u2019t agree to licensing some of their graphic patents. The initial plan to sell two businesses has grown to include the entire company, in light of rapidly dropping financial numbers.\n\u201cthere can be no certainty\u201d\nImagination wrote in April: \u201cApple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination\u2019s technology, without violating Imagination\u2019s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information,\u201d even if Apple said otherwise. Despite the sale, Imagination says it remains in dispute with Apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
