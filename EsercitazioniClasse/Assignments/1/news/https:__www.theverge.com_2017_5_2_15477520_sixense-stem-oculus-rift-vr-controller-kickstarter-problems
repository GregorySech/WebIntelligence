{"title": "The Sixense Stem was once the ultimate VR controller. Where is it now?", "content": " \nIt was September 2013, and Alexey Volochenko had seen what seemed like a big breakthrough in the emerging field of virtual reality: a controller called the Sixense Stem. Volochenko had been an early adopter of the Oculus Rift \u2014 he\u2019d gotten one of its first-generation DK1 development kits, long before Facebook decided the fledgling company was worth $2 billion. Where the Rift had put people\u2019s heads in VR, the Stem promised to track their entire body as well. On the very first day, Volochenko says he put down $300, eagerly anticipating getting his new system in July 2014.\nWhen the Sixense Kickstarter opened, the Oculus Rift DK1 had been shipping for roughly six months. While impressive at the time, the DK1 was far more modest than the consumer-ready Rift that would launch in 2016. It had no external tracking and no controller except the Xbox gamepad \u2014 which Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey admitted wasn\u2019t sufficient. So into the vacuum poured small companies with experimental and sometimes bizarre solutions, many of which turned to Kickstarter for funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original Sixense Stem design on Kickstarter.\nImage: Sixense\n\n\nOn Kickstarter, you could find the slippery Virtuix Omni treadmill and the very similar Cyberith Virtualizer, which let people run in VR. You could help fund the Delta Six, a detailed replica gun. Companies often promised compatibility between different products; a company called Tactical Haptics planned to build its Reactive Grip controllers on the Stem tracking system. Together, all these projects let people envision a future where you could act out almost anything you wanted in virtual reality, mixing and matching the perfect full-body VR platform.\nBut today, Volochenko and thousands of other Stem backers are still waiting. Nearly three years after its projected launch, the Stem is perpetually a few months away; Sixense CEO Amir Rubin currently anticipates shipping in June 2017. Rubin says these delays have resulted in a better product, and some backers are still confident. For others, the STEM is a lost cause \u2014 a once-groundbreaking product that became a casualty of modern VR\u2019s fast-moving and chaotic early years.\n\u201cI had no second doubts about backing their campaign.\u201d\nUnlike many VR companies, Sixense wasn\u2019t a brand-new startup. Founded in 2007, it had worked with gaming hardware maker Razer on the Hydra motion controller, which was released in 2011. The Hydra was a flop at release, but it was rediscovered by Rift development kit owners, who realized they could use it to mimic hands in virtual reality. When Razer\u2019s limited stock quickly sold out, Sixense promised to fill the gap with a new and more powerful successor. \u201c[Sixense] was a real company with experience and [a] track record of shipping production units at this point,\u201d Volochenko recalls. \u201cI had no second doubts about backing their campaign and supporting them.\u201d\nThe Stem was comprised of one base station and up to five small sensor packs, two of which fit into handheld controllers with an array of buttons, analog sticks, and triggers. A weak magnetic field could precisely detect the position of each sensor over a radius of eight feet, nearly three times the Hydra\u2019s range. Early-bird backers could get the cheapest configuration for $149, and a \u201cmaxed-out\u201d version started at $1,000. The Stem didn\u2019t raise as much money as the super-successful Virtuix Omni, which netted a total of $1.1 million. But the controller market was wide open, and it ended with around 2,300 supporters and $600,000 in funding, more than double the $250,000 Sixense had asked for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSixense promised support for Hydra-compatible games like Portal 2.\n\n\nFor a while, things seemed to be going fine. But shortly before the projected launch, Sixense announced that the Stem would be launching later because of hardware changes. While delays are almost inevitable on Kickstarter, the controller was soon pushed to the end of the year, then to 2015 after the product failed FCC regulatory testing. It eventually passed, but Sixense had missed its scheduled window for production, and the Stem was officially bumped to 2016.\nBy that time, the world of virtual reality had drastically changed. When the Stem was announced, Sixense was one of VR\u2019s biggest names in a deeply fragmented industry; my former colleague Sean Hollister named both it and Oculus \u201cfairly safe bets\u201d at the end of 2013. Three years later, the Oculus Rift had its own motion controllers, and so did the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR, neither of which even existed when Sixense\u2019s Kickstarter launched. People would have to actively choose the Stem over several better-known options, and it still hadn\u2019t shipped.\n\u201cWe are an R&D team. We are not an engineering team.\u201d\nThe problem was that while Sixense had spent many years developing hardware, it had never actually released a consumer product by itself \u2014 not even the Hydra, which Razer had a large hand in building. \u201cRazer did all the industrial design and mechanical engineering\u201d on the Hydra, says Rubin now. \u201cWe are an R&D team. We are not an engineering team.\u201d As a result, Sixense wasn\u2019t experienced in working with manufacturers overseas, handling regulatory testing, or fine-tuning things like the Stem\u2019s plastic casing.\nOther companies have certainly overcome similar hurdles, including Oculus, with its infamous manufacturing woes. But the original Rift development kit had surprisingly simple hardware. The Stem is a multi-part wireless tracking system with two gaming controllers, which ended up being far tougher to design than Sixense anticipated. \u201cWhen you look at the Xbox controller and the Dualshock Controller, the triggers are a hugely complex and challenging mechanical engineering problem,\u201d says Rubin. As of mid-April, the Stem\u2019s triggers were still being tweaked.\n\n\nThe Sixense Stem at CES 2015.\n\nDespite all these setbacks, the Stem wasn\u2019t some piece of vaporware rendering. Sixense still regularly takes prototypes on tour at major trade shows like the Game Developers Conference and CES. The company appeared at CES 2015 with an unofficial VR lightsaber demo that won The Verge\u2019s \u201cBest VR\u201d award. The core system was solid \u2014 Sixense just hasn\u2019t been able to turn it into something polished enough to mass-produce.\nAs the controller\u2019s original niche became increasingly crowded, Sixense began expanding its original scope, aiming for businesses and research institutions as well as home users. It recently debuted a piece of design software called MakeVR for the HTC Vive. In addition to slimming down the system, it added new features, adapting the Stem for use on smartphone-based headsets as well as PCs. \u201cThe key focus for Sixense is mobile,\u201d Rubin says now. \u201cMobile VR is where VR will reach scale, reach the mass market.\u201d\nThe core system works \u2014 it just hasn\u2019t scaled\nSixense is, in fact, well-placed to enter the mobile VR world. Mobile headset makers have started toying with a potentially game-changing feature called inside-out tracking, which gives mobile VR users a range of movement that currently requires external cameras or sensors. But in this system, handheld motion controllers would need a direct line of sight to head-mounted cameras instead \u2014 which could present a problem when people do something as simple as raise their arms. With the Stem, you could mount a small base station on the headset itself, which would track hands through magnetic fields instead of cameras. It\u2019s not the only way to solve this problem, but it could be a pretty good one.\nAnd for some Kickstarter backers, even Sixense\u2019s original idea has unique advantages over the Rift and Vive\u2019s tracking systems, which need a direct view of controllers to work smoothly. \u201cThe killer feature is magnetic tracking that doesn't require line-of-sight,\u201d says backer Chris Jarram. If he\u2019s playing a game like virtual pool (a real and fairly popular pursuit), having one hand even momentarily obscured can ruin a shot. \u201cThese problems won't exist with the Stem,\u201d Jarram says. As long as the system ships, he\u2019ll have a place for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stem\u2019s near-final design, as of December.\n\n\nFor others, though, the moment has passed. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology researcher Markus Zank backed the Stem to use with his department\u2019s Rift, but was frustrated when it failed to arrive in time for a student thesis project in 2015. He\u2019s now satisfied with the HTC Vive, and has been seeking a refund since mid-2016. \u201cThe VR market was completely different from when we originally backed them,\u201d says Zank. \u201cAnd it was clear that they would not be able to bring this product to the market.\u201d Volochenko has also requested a refund several times. And what Sixense sees as exciting new capabilities, he sees as feature creep. \u201cI don't see the point anymore even if they ship the unit now,\u201d he says. \u201cBack in 2014 this would've been a great unit to have; now it\u2019s obsolete hardware with no software support.\u201d\n\u201cI don't see the point anymore even if they ship the unit now.\u201d\nSixense\u2019s changes and challenges echo those of other companies with crowdfunded VR peripherals, which have spent years trying to deliver on their ideas while staying relevant. Virtuix decided to sell the Omni primarily to arcades instead of home consumers, and as costs climbed, it canceled all international Kickstarter backers\u2019 orders late last year. Tactical Haptics\u2019 original Kickstarter failed, and it\u2019s spent the past years developing new prototypes for Rift and Vive controllers, before recently getting a $2.2 million investment. Cyberith, which Jarram also backed, began selling business-focused hardware and failed to deliver to backers; Jarram and others are now considering a class action lawsuit against the company.\nRubin says that of the roughly 2,100 people waiting for Stem systems, around 150 have asked for refunds. He\u2019s noncommittal about what the exact policy will be, and several people \u2014 including Zank and Volochenko \u2014 say Sixense hasn\u2019t responded to their requests. In a March interview with Rev VR Podcast host Reverend Kyle, Rubin said that the final call lay with outside investors who have covered most of what he describes as \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of dollars in development costs, but he would recommend offering refunds to backers at the point the Stem was ready to ship. \u201cIt's out of my control at the moment,\u201d he said.\nSixense may offer refunds to backers once the Stem is ready to ship\nGiven the Stem\u2019s long history of missed deadlines, it\u2019s possible that its latest one will slip as well. In a mid-April Kickstarter update, Sixense said it was fixing the final problems with the Stem\u2019s plastic housing, in preparation for its impending launch. Responses were overwhelmingly skeptical and negative. \u201cIt's like trying to develop a Betamax player when everyone is using Blu-ray,\u201d one backer complained. \u201cIn other news, I've had two children since backing this project,\u201d quipped another. Internet comments aren\u2019t a good barometer of overall support. But there\u2019s also less of the forgiving optimism that you can find in earlier updates, when many people just wanted to know what was going on.\nThen again, maybe the Stem finally is on track for release. By early May, Rubin expects to have 20 to 25 prototypes available to backers who pledged $1,000 or more. If this goes well, Sixense\u2019s suppliers will deliver a few hundred finished products and gradually scale up from there. He anticipates getting plastics delivered from China by the end of May, and starting to ship Stem units to all backers in early June.\nIn the long run, the Stem\u2019s greatest legacy might be as a catalyst, not a product. For many people, including me, using it was one of the first times that virtual reality seemed like a place you could walk around and interact with, not just visit and observe. It encouraged developers to think about natural motion long before big headset makers were promoting it. Even as he admits to the Stem\u2019s problems, Rubin proudly recalls the game developers and VR companies that he says were inspired by trying the system. \u201cIt's not about arrogance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's about what VR needed.\u201d\n"}
