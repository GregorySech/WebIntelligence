{"title": "Apple GPU provider Imagination sells itself to private equity firm after losing contract", "content": " \nImagination Technologies, the UK-based chip maker that used to provide Apple with its mobile graphics components, has agreed to sell itself to Canyon Bridge, a Silicon Valley-based private equity firm backed by the Chinese fund Yitai Capital. The news, first reported today by the Financial Times, comes nearly six months after Apple, Imagination\u2019s biggest customer, announced that it would no longer require the company\u2019s services. Canyon Bridge is paying \u00a3550 million ($743.2 million) for the deal.\nApple\u2019s announcement, back in April, halved Imagination\u2019s stock price almost overnight, creating a existential crisis for the firm. At the time, Apple confirmed it was bringing mobile graphics development in-house, a move that eventually manifested itself in the A11 Bionic chip revealed during the iPhone 8 and iPhone X hardware event earlier this month. The chip, designed specifically to help with graphics-intensive operations like artificial intelligence and augmented reality, is part of a big push to differentiate Apple\u2019s smartphone line from competitors\u2019, relying on the company\u2019s signature optimization of hardware and software. \nIn June, Imagination said it was putting itself up for sale. The company had been looking into taking legal action to explore whether Apple could bring GPU development in-house without infringing on its technology. \u201cApple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination\u2019s technology, without violating Imagination\u2019s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information,\u201d the company said earlier this year. In its note to investors, Imagination says that it remains \u201cin dispute with Apple,\u201d yet it\u2019s unclear when and under what terms a settlement might occur. \n"}
