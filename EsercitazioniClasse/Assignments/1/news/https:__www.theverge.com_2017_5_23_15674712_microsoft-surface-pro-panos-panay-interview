{"title": "Microsoft is placing a big bet on its new Surface family", "content": " \nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface chief, Panos Panay, is pumped, and that\u2019s not an unusual thing. \nA week after introducing the Surface Laptop to the world, he\u2019s sitting in a room in Microsoft\u2019s Building 88 ready to show off his team\u2019s latest creation: the new Surface Pro. At first glance, it looks a lot like 2015\u2019s Surface Pro 4, but it\u2019s part of a bigger lineup of the entire Surface family that Microsoft is now ready to take worldwide. \nFor the first time in Surface history, Microsoft will start shipping two new products (Surface Pro and Surface Laptop) worldwide at launch. June 15th will see these new products launch, and a big expansion for the Surface Studio all-in-one PC, too. It\u2019s clearly a date that Microsoft has been working toward for quite some time, and as I walked around Microsoft\u2019s secretive Surface building located at its Redmond, Washington, campus, it\u2019s easy to see that the Surface family of devices is now coming to life.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken our time to get that right, we\u2019ve been pretty patient,\u201d explains Panay. \u201cWe feel like the family\u2019s launching... that was one of the goals, to be able to have the moment... walk in [a Microsoft Store], there\u2019s the Surface table, what product is best for you to come to the family. That was important.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Pro.\nPhoto by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\n\nThe new Surface Pro is a refinement\nThis Surface family now includes a new Pro, which is more of a refinement over the previous device rather than any radical changes. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit that spot where we\u2019re aware what the product is supposed to be for every single customer,\u201d explains Panay. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where it would have been a shame to call this Surface Pro 5. This is Surface Pro.\u201d The new Surface Pro includes Intel\u2019s latest processors, a claimed 13.5 hours of battery life, an improved hinge, a refined design, and a much better stylus for illustrators and designers. Microsoft is even shipping a Surface Pro with LTE support \u2014 an option that\u2019s long been missing from the Pro line \u2014 later this year. \u201cIt\u2019s where we wanted to be, and we\u2019re here,\u201d says Panay. \u201cSo I get pumped.\u201d\nPanos Panay is confident the new Surface Pro will be a success, and that\u2019s part of the reason it will be available worldwide at launch. Microsoft is taking a big bet on both the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro by shipping them worldwide, and it will be a test of how well it has planned logistically for inventory and demand. Microsoft previously took a $900 million loss on its original Surface RT, largely because the company overestimated demand and manufactured too many devices. It was a painful lesson that the Surface team has learned from, and Microsoft has launched Surface devices gradually in regions worldwide ever since. June 15th is different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the new Surface Pro.\nPhoto by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\n\nMicrosoft's Surface chief is confident the Surface Pro will sell well\n\u201cI believe it will be the fastest adopted Pro we\u2019ve ever shipped,\u201d says Panay. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that, the brand is here and there\u2019s people who have been waiting for it, and it turns out it\u2019s just a kick-ass device.\u201d It\u2019s also the original device that really kicked off the idea of Surface. \u201cThis is our baby, the Surface brand was created on the back of Surface Pro,\u201d explains Panay. \u201cWe created this category... we\u2019re just going to keep throwing energy at it so it\u2019s perfect for the customer, which is important.\u201d \nLooking at all the Surface devices side by side, the family aspect is clear. There\u2019s a Surface Book for performance, a Surface Laptop for most consumers, a Surface Pro for the combination of tablet and laptop, and a Surface Studio for a new take on the all-in-one PC. It\u2019s the kind of impressive hardware lineup you\u2019d expect from a company like Apple, but it\u2019s actually Microsoft bringing it to life. Thanks to the new Surface Laptop, there\u2019s now a computer for everyone in Microsoft\u2019s Surface family. The only device that\u2019s missing is a phone, but it\u2019s not clear if Microsoft will ever venture into that space again.\nI also got the chance to tour Microsoft\u2019s Building 87 during my visit to see the new Surface Pro. It\u2019s an unassuming building that contains the company\u2019s extraordinary hardware labs where Microsoft engineers create future devices. The front desk is chaired by Debbie Lueder, who reminds of me Michael Caine\u2019s Alfred character from Batman, controlling access to a building full of machines and secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's Surface operation is huge now\nThe last time I visited Microsoft\u2019s Surface buildings, the company had a few floors in another building; now the operation is huge. Inside is a mix of equipment, machine shops, laboratories, and talented engineers. I met with a variety of engineers, but Gopal Gopal stood out. He works in the quietest room in the world, Microsoft\u2019s anechoic chamber, and he\u2019s a master of sound. Gopal stood and talked to me like his voice was buffering during a bad phone call, intentionally missing words to demonstrate the type of problems he works on. The way he held a conversation like that simply blew my mind.\nMicrosoft\u2019s machinery, 3D printers, and anechoic chambers are all impressive, but it\u2019s the combined investment that\u2019s most striking. Microsoft has engineers like Stevie Bathiche, Ralf Groene, and Ron Smith, all working on these Surface devices, and it\u2019s infectious to watch them describe with passion how this hardware comes to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\n\nMicrosoft is getting serious about Surface\nI\u2019ve always wondered whether Microsoft is simply trying to push the PC industry forward, testing out its own hardware, or just attempting to beat Apple at its own game. It\u2019s now clear to me that, starting on June 15th, Microsoft is getting serious about its Surface family of hardware. That\u2019s a risky bet, especially as the company had \u201clower than expected Surface Pro unit volume\u201d during its recent quarterly results, but Microsoft looks well positioned to push the Surface line forward with the new Laptop and Pro devices.\nMicrosoft now has four distinct PCs, two buildings dedicated to Surface, and hundreds of engineers figuring out things like how people type to the amount of light required for backlit keyboards. It's a big operation now, and while we don't know how much Microsoft is spending on Surface, when you add up this amount of investment, it's clearly a lot.\nThe company doesn't seem to be slowing down, either. \u201cWe have so many inventions to come, our future is super bright,\u201d explains Panay. \u201cFor now, the customer who wants to be productive or creative, this is it. It might be because it\u2019s my baby, but at the end of the day this [the Surface Pro] is the perfect product for that. I love the Laptop, I love Book, I adore Studio... but this is where it all started.\u201d\n"}
