{"title": "Motorola may be working on its first Android tablet in years", "content": " \nMotorola appears to be working on its first tablet in more than five years. Android Police reports that a 9-to-10-inch tablet with a \u201cpremium look and feel\u201d is in development, and the site published a single photo of the device\u2019s screen as evidence.\nThe photo isn\u2019t very revealing, but it does show that the tablet will have a version of the multitasking features introduced on the Yoga Book, made by Motorola parent company Lenovo. The feature, called \u201cproductivity mode,\u201d allows apps to be run side by side, with still-running apps being displayed in the black strip at the bottom of the screen beside Android\u2019s navigation buttons. It essentially turns that area into a dock, which is a smart way to take advantage of the extra screen space.\nTablet shipments are dropping, but Motorola seems to be going in anyway\nIt\u2019s a little surprising to see Motorola step back into the tablet market after so much time away. The tablet market as a whole hasn\u2019t been performing well, and Android tablets have never been in particularly good shape. With Apple releasing a $329 iPad just over a month ago, breaking in is only going to get harder.\nBut there is one area of the tablet market that\u2019s growing: research firm IDC says that \u201cdetachables\u201d \u2014 tablets like the iPad Pro that have first-party removable keyboards \u2014 are increasing in shipments even though traditional tablets are losing popularity. Between the large screen, productivity features, and reported premium feel, it\u2019s entirely possible Motorola is going to shoot for this market with its new device.\nGetting back into tablets is probably a bit easier for Motorola now, too. Lenovo hasn\u2019t left the Android tablet space, and, in fact, it introduced one very compelling option just last year. Bringing together Motorola\u2019s design sense with Lenovo\u2019s existing engineering certainly sounds promising. Though it\u2019s still hard to imagine they can solve the problems that regularly plague Android tablets.\n"}
