{"title": "Capcom\u2019s Monster Hunter series is coming to Nintendo Switch", "content": " \nThe Nintendo Switch just got a significant third-party boost: Capcom has announced that it\u2019ll be bringing Monster Hunter XX to the new system. Monster Hunter isn\u2019t the most popular series in the West, but it\u2019s been huge in Japan since the days of the PSP, and it was seen as a major coup for Nintendo when the games eschewed Sony\u2019s PS Vita for the 3DS.\nMonster Hunter XX \u2014 pronounced \u201cdouble cross\u201d \u2014 is the latest entry in the action RPG series; an expanded version of Monster Hunter X, which was released in the US in 2015 as Monster Hunter Generations. XX came out in Japan in March, and hasn\u2019t yet been announced for the West.\n\n\n\u901f\u5831\u3067\u3059\uff01\u300e\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30af\u30ed\u30b9 Nintendo Switch Ver.\u300f\u767a\u58f2\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\u30e2\u30f3\u30cf\u30f3\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u6700\u5927\u7d1a\u306e\u72e9\u308a\u3054\u305f\u3048\u304cNintendo Switch\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3080\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3088\uff5e\uff01https://t.co/CXQuLkXAKo #MHXX #nintendoswitch pic.twitter.com/j2pdsvmOtj\u2014 MHXX Official (@MHXX_CAPCOM) May 26, 2017\n\n\n\nOn paper, the Switch is the perfect platform for Monster Hunter. It could let you play local co-op multiplayer on the go, the main reason the series took off in Japan in the first place, while also allowing for big-screen online play at home. It should also be the best-looking and best-controlling portable version of the game yet, given the Switch\u2019s power and actual analog sticks.\nThat said, Capcom has revealed nothing about Monster Hunter XX: Nintendo Switch Ver. beyond the fact that it will exist at some point. There\u2019ll be a Monster Hunter event in Sapporo, Japan this Saturday, so we should know more by the weekend.\n"}
