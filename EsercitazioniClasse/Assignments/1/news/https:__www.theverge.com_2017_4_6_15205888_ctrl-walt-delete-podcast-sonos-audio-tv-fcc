{"title": "Is Sonos the solution for your TV audio problems?", "content": " \nWalt\u2019s column this week focuses on the problems with audio on the latest TVs. They have become very thin with small bezels, so there\u2019s barely any room to put decent speakers on the product. Walt and Nilay discuss Sonos\u2019 solution to this problem on Ctrl-Walt-Delete. \nAlso, FCC news continues after Congress\u2019 rollback of FCC\u2019s privacy rules and this podcast continues to update you. \n\n\nWe love your feedback on the topics of the show and suggestions on how to make our podcasts better and more fun for the new year. You can tweet at Walt at @waltmossberg and Nilay at @reckless.
