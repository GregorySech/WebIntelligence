{"title": "Niantic boss John Hanke on Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s first year and what\u2019s next", "content": " \nA year ago today, Pok\u00e9mon Go began its descent on the world, kicking off an unprecedented summer that saw tens of millions of players explore the world around them through the augmented reality game. Since then, Pok\u00e9mon Go has changed a lot, with the addition of new pok\u00e9mon, features like in-game events, and more recently the addition of cooperative raids. But there\u2019s still a lot missing from the game: most notably player-versus-player combat and the ability to trade pok\u00e9mon, both features developer Niantic has previously said were in the works.\nJust ahead of the game\u2019s anniversary, I had the chance to talk to Niantic CEO John Hanke about the status of Pok\u00e9mon Go 12 months in. We talked about everything from the developer\u2019s ongoing war with cheaters, to the importance of communicating with players, to just why those much-anticipated features are taking so long.\nThis interview had been edited and condensed for clarity.\nNow that you\u2019re coming up on the one-year anniversary, how do you feel about the state of the game? Is it where you want it to be?\nWell, it\u2019s been a great year. We feel incredibly grateful for everything that\u2019s happened. We\u2019ve gotten ourselves into a position where we\u2019re able to put a lot more resources onto the team over the past year. We were careful in hiring people, so we ramped up over the course of the year. But we\u2019re finally seeing the fruits of that in the gyms and raids release, which gets to things that are near and dear to our heart, like cooperative social gameplay, things that pull people together outside.\nSo we\u2019re really happy with the initial phase of that release. We\u2019re super excited about how that\u2019s going to interact with the events we have lined up for the duration of the summer in Chicago, and Yokohama, and Europe. It\u2019s been great to get that release out there and fix some aspects of gyms that were bugging us, that we didn\u2019t really like but had to leave things when we shipped the product. But we\u2019re pretty happy with the release in June, and glad to see a positive response. It seems to have really energized the playerbase. And I think it will do even more so in June and July, as the events part of that kicks in.\nWhen you look at where the game is now, and compare it to your initial road map, how similar are the two?\nWe lost probably six months on our schedule because of the success of the game. Really all the way through November and December, from launch onward we were rebuilding and rewiring infrastructure just to keep the game running at the scale that we were running at. We were fortunate to have a massive launch, a massive success, and many, many more users than we had planned for. But we had to redirect a substantial portion of the engineering team to [work on] infrastructure versus new features. That switched off things like extending gyms, it pushed out things we still want to have, like player-versus-player and trading. I\u2019d say we\u2019re about six months behind where we thought we would be.\n\u201cWe\u2019re about six months behind where we thought we would be.\u201d\nOn the other hand, we did Pok\u00e9mon Go Plus, which was something we took on kind of late in the cycle. But it was fun to get that experience with a hardware add-on. We [added generation two pok\u00e9mon], we\u2019ve staffed up our live operations team, and I think players have really enjoyed the events we\u2019ve been able to do. There are some things we did that we weren\u2019t necessarily planning, and others we haven\u2019t quite gotten to yet.\nDo you think it would have been possible to be prepared for a launch like that, given how many people were playing the game pretty much right away?\nIt\u2019s possible, but you would have to be probably insane or completely irrational. You could do all of the work, and anticipate that, and build for that. But it would be hard, I think, to know when to do that, and to be right about it. I think we hit a not bad compromise of having done the work on the back end so that it was theoretically capable of scaling. And with some hiccups and brief outages, we actually were able to scale up to orders of magnitude greater than what we thought we would get. We sort of overbuilt, and we used every bit of that over-engineering that was there, and we still had some outages. It wasn\u2019t a bad place in terms of the compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you look back over the last 12 months, are there things you would have done differently with the perspective you have now?\nCertainly if we could\u2019ve predicted the future, it would\u2019ve been great to have had an even bigger team working on the product so we could have even more of the features that we want in at launch. We delayed our ability to get to things like the gyms and the raids, and we haven\u2019t gotten to the player-versus-player and some of the things we thought we\u2019d be able to get to pretty shortly after launch. But we only had so much money, and we were doing what we thought was reasonable.\nWhat about in terms of communication? Do you wish you hadn\u2019t talked about things like PvP and trading, given how long they\u2019re taking to implement?\nWell, had we not had to divert resources to infrastructure versus features, I think we would\u2019ve had some of those things out earlier. I don\u2019t know. If we had of known we were going to have those delays, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have talked so much about them. Although, it\u2019s important to let people know that you\u2019re thinking about certain things, and that you are building toward them, even if they\u2019re not immediately available.\n\u201cWe were doing what we thought was reasonable.\u201d\nI think early on, between ourselves and The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo, there wasn\u2019t a real consensus about how to communicate with players on forums like Reddit, Twitter, and other social media platforms. With our previous game Ingress we were very communicative with players, and very open. And we weren\u2019t as communicative and open in the beginning [of Pok\u00e9mon Go] because that was sort of a new process for our partners. I think we\u2019ve become much more open over time, and that\u2019s really helped make the community happier, by us being present and talking more about what\u2019s going on.\nCan you talk a bit about some of the times you did diverge from that road map you had based on the feedback you received?\nThere are features that weren\u2019t on the original road map that really grew out of that feedback and back-and-forth with players. The gym badges, the way that whole system works, that\u2019s something that grew out of the dialogue with players. The changes we made to combat in gyms \u2014 there are more coming, but the ones that we shipped this month were based on just watching how the mechanics around gyms played out. It ended up being heavily weighted toward the upper 1 percent of users, so gyms had become something that weren\u2019t really accessible to low-level players, and weren\u2019t very dynamic in terms of there being turnover and opportunities for people to have a chance to have a pok\u00e9mon in a gym.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you anticipate just how much effort you would have to put toward dealing with cheating? It seems like there\u2019s a new story about it every week.\nWe had some experience with that with Ingress. We knew that location spoofing and people building fake clients to do things would be an issue. I don\u2019t think we anticipated the degree to which people would do that. The success of the game is I think what made it a little bit different from Ingress. Because of the scale [of Pok\u00e9mon Go], there are actual commercial entities that sprung up that were offering services to level up your account or do various other things, and were real businesses. Therefore they\u2019re able to invest significant resources in these things. We didn\u2019t really anticipate that scale of commercial-funded cheating, which is a challenge to keep the game fair for everyone.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a challenge to keep the game fair for everyone.\u201d\nHas it been a sizable effort internally to fight cheating? From the outside it definitely seems like a lot of effort is put toward it.\nWe dedicate resources to it for sure. There are people working on that that could be working on features, but they\u2019re not. It\u2019s a fraction of the team. It\u2019s not as if half of the team is working on that. It\u2019s significantly less than that. But there is a chunk of resources that we devote to that.\nWhat do you think is the most important update or change you\u2019ve made to the game with regards to keeping players coming back regularly?\nIf I had to single out one, I think it\u2019s the [gyms and raids update] that we just put out. It really is the first new mechanic that gives people motivation to keep playing, to keep leveling up pok\u00e9mon, to continue to get out and be active. The collection mechanic was something that was really the heart of the game, and it still is the heart of the game for new users, but this [improves] the game for players who have reached a certain level. I think that\u2019s the single biggest change because of that challenge and opportunity of fun that it presents to more experienced players. And also, it\u2019s designed to encourage cooperative play, which is core to our mission.\n"}
