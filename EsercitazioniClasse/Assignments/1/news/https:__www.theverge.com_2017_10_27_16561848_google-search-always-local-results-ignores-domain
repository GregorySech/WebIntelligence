{"title": "Google no longer lets you change domains to search different countries", "content": " \nYou\u2019ve long been able to get localized search results by visiting Google at different domains \u2014 like google.com for the US, google.co.uk for England, or google.co.jp for Japan \u2014 but that won\u2019t be the case any more after today. Google said that it\u2019ll now deliver search results relevant to your current location no matter which domain you visit. So if you\u2019re in New York and visit google.ru, you\u2019ll still get results relevant to New York City.\nFortunately, it\u2019ll still be possible to escape your country\u2019s results. You\u2019ll be able to change locations, you\u2019ll just have to do it through the settings menu at the bottom of google.com (which I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ve never noticed before because it\u2019s hidden in the corner on the desktop and requires you to scroll down on mobile; I didn\u2019t know it existed before today). By going to settings and then \u201csearch settings,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to pick a new location.\nYouTube and Gmail already worked this way\nGoogle says it\u2019s making the change because one out of five searches \u201cis related to location,\u201d and the company feels it\u2019s critical to offer local information to provide the best results. The feature seems to be tailored most toward travelers: Google says that if you visit another country, it\u2019ll automatically serve results local to where you\u2019re visiting, then switch back again as soon as you arrive home. Before, if a traveler had kept typing in their home country\u2019s Google domain, they may not have gotten what Google sees as ideal search results.\nThe change isn\u2019t supposed to affect how Google handles legal requirements, such as the removal of specific results under Europe\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201d In an email to The Verge, Google clarified that users will see results removed appropriate for whichever location their search is set to; however, if the country they\u2019re physically in requires results to be removed no matter what, then results will get stripped out regardless of which location they choose.\nApparently this is how Google has been operating many of its existing services already, including YouTube and Gmail. The policy of always serving local results will now apply to desktop and mobile searches, as well as Google Maps and the iOS Google app.\n"}
