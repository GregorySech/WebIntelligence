{"title": "President Trump says TiVo is \u2018one of the great inventions of all time\u2019", "content": " \nPresident Trump\u2019s fixation with TV and cable news has been well chronicled; he tuned in obsessively during the campaign, and he continues to now from the White House. And like millions of other people who make television a central fixture of their day, Trump seems to be a fan of TiVo. During a recent interview with Time, Trump credited the DVR as \u201cone of the great inventions of all time.\u201d \nNow, he said this while fast forwarding through clips from a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s meddling with the 2016 election \u2014 a subject that the president isn\u2019t particularly fond of. So Trump might\u2019ve just been pointing out the utility and convenience of time shifting; it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s actually a TiVo box in the White House. But Time also revealed something else that definitely is: Trump has installed a TV with a screen measuring over 60 inches in the dining room. Prior US presidents have also had televisions there, but \u201cusually small ones, no larger than a bread box, tucked away on a sideboard shelf.\u201d Trump was never going to go for that.\nMeanwhile, TiVo is still in the DVR business; it introduced the 4K Bolt+ last September. But so is every cable provider. So nowadays, many of the company\u2019s news releases pertain to \u201creaching intellectual property agreements with\u201d (and thus getting paid by) tech and content giants like Samsung, Netflix, HBO, Roku, and others. \n"}
