{"title": "Indie smartwatches are doomed as long as Apple and Google have control", "content": " \nSmartwatches are having a rough time. No matter what your chosen platform, sales are mostly down, hardware is mostly bulky, software is mostly slow, and battery life is mostly poor. The industry in general seems to be pivoting towards a slew of similar Android Wear watches where the main difference is in what fashion brand logo they bear.\nBut yet, there are still dreamers like the folks behind the Dagadam Watch, which is looking for backing on Kickstarter. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the Dagadam\u2019s hardware on its own \u2014 it\u2019s a nice enough looking (if a bit thick) touchscreen smartwatch that uses an interesting touch bezel control scheme and has a claimed three days of battery life. But the idea of launching an independent third-party smartwatch based on a proprietary software platform in today\u2019s market just seems incredibly foolhardy. \nThere are two, maybe three viable full smartwatch platforms right now\nAs it stands, there are two, maybe three viable smartwatch platforms right now:\n\nApple Watch, because Apple also makes iPhones and refuses to allow anyone else to have similar levels of integration into iOS. That means that unlike third parties like Pebble, Apple can integrate iMessage and allow Apple Watch apps to be bundled together with the iPhone apps you already have installed.\nAndroid Wear, which has a similar advantage, allowing developers to easily tie their existing Android apps into Google\u2019s smartwatch platform. That gives Android Wear great third-party support, with the added backing of Google\u2019s massive software chops.\nAnd Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Gear line, which is probably the closest comparison to something like the Dagadam. Recent Gear watches also run their own proprietary platform with more limited developer support than Android Wear or the Apple Watch;  but unlike the Dagadam, where the success or failure of the company is riding on a single product, Samsung is a multi-billion dollar corporation that has the resources to keep the Gear line going for years, even if it sells poorly. \n\nThat\u2019s it. The next closest we\u2019ve ever had to a viable third party contender was Pebble, which despite having literally everything going for it \u2014 first to market, great design, outstanding battery life, positive reviews, dedicated customers, and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding \u2014 still couldn\u2019t beat the established players. It was recently sold on the cheap to Fitbit and won\u2019t be making or supporting its hardware anymore. \nSure, the Dagadam Watch has made its $100,000 funding goal on Kickstarter. It\u2019ll hopefully ship to backers, despite coming from a first time company. But even if somehow the Dagadam Watch has, bar none, the single greatest smartwatch hardware and interface ever made, beating out Apple\u2019s billions of dollars in R&D and Google\u2019s teams of top software engineers \u2014 which is about as realistic as thinking that your crowdfunded smartphone will somehow top the Galaxy S8 or Apple\u2019s next iPhone \u2014 it still won\u2019t matter so long as Apple and Google have total control over the playing field. \nSmartwatches are still too tied to a smartphone\nI\u2019m not saying that more competition in this market would be bad \u2014 competition is great! But there\u2019s no way around the fact that the technology we have today for smartwatches is simply too tied to a host smartphone for core functionality. And when you rely on a smartphone, Apple, Google, and even Samsung have such a home court advantage that it\u2019s nearly impossible for even the scrappiest Kickstarter to overcome. It was a core factor in hastening Pebble\u2019s demise, and it\u2019ll continue to shut down future contenders until smartwatches can somehow break free of their inherent reliance on smartphones. \nAnd cutting the tether to smartphones is a tough task. Adding LTE might be able to do it, but you\u2019ll need a bigger, more power-hungry radio \u2014 which of course means even worse battery life and a chunkier watch \u2014 along with the added cost of separate cellular service. And the efforts we\u2019ve seen so far in that vein have come across more as hobbled smartphones than truly independent smartwatches. \nAll hope isn\u2019t lost in the watch industry \u2014 hybrid smartwatches that simply track fitness data and buzz for notifications are far less reliant on a tethered smartphone, and increasingly could be the future of wearables. But for now, it\u2019s hard to look at any third party smartwatch like the Dagadam as anything but an exercise in futility. \n"}
