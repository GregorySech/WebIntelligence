{"title": "Google drops price of its USB-C to headphone jack dongle down to $9 from $20", "content": " \nGoogle released a new USB-C to 3.5mm dongle following the reveal earlier this month of the headphone jack-less Pixel 2. Although every new Pixel 2 ships with the dongle in the box, a replacement costs $20. That's appalling. Now, it seems Google has realized its dongle error and is dropping the price down to $9, or the same as Apple's Lighting to headphone jack replacement dongle. All is well again in dongle world, phew.\nJust a note: Google's dongle isn't for charging and listening to music. If you want to do that, you'll have to buy a much more expensive dongle. Google currently only lists the third-party Moshi dongle for $44.95, which is still $10 more than the Belkin alternative for the iPhone. I'm sure more will sprout up on Amazon and in Google's own store, but for now, this is what we got.\n\n"}
