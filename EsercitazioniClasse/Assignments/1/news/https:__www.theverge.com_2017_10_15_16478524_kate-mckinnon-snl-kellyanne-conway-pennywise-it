{"title": "Kate McKinnon is flawless as Pennywise on SNL, but it\u2019s a tired joke about Kellyanne Conway", "content": " Earlier this year, Kate McKinnon lampooned Kellyanne Conway\u2019s efforts to spin the news while being interviewed on talk shows in a couple of sketches on Saturday Night Live. During last night\u2019s episode, McKinnon reprised her role as President Donald Trump\u2019s counselor with a bit of help from Pennywise the dancing clown from this summer\u2019s blockbuster horror film, It.The sketch opens with Anderson Cooper  played by Alex Moffat , commenting on a statement from Conway, and when a producer mentions that she\u2019s available for comment, he asks \u201care we that desperate?\u201d He then leaves the CNN building  clad in a bright yellow rain jacket , and encounters a Conway in a sewer drain, a parody of the opening scenes in It when Georgie meets Pennywise.The scene has been parodied quite a bit before, ranging from fan-made reenactments to memes about paying one\u2019s student loans. It\u2019s a great bit because it plays into the lengths that people will go to in desperate situations. SNL has McKinnon\u2019s Conway try to entice Cooper off a bunch of outrageous talking points that she  quotes designed to grab ratings for the network, reveals that she\u2019s already enticed Rachel Maddow, and turns into Hillary Clinton.Portraying Conway as a desperate clown going to great lengths to get onto TV is a tired conceit at this point \u2014 depicting Conway is desperate to spin public perceptions of the Trump administration is already a low bar to hit, and It has been out in theaters for weeks now. Fortunately, it\u2019s worth watching to see McKinnn\u2019s fantastic depiction of Pennywise."}
