{"title": "Game of Thrones Hope Chest: what\u2019s Bran Stark\u2019s ultimate role in the story?", "content": " \nGame of Thrones has never been about giving readers or viewers what they most want. Its author and screenwriters prefer to build fan expectations, then overturn them for narrative impact \u2014 and sometimes for pure shock value. And yet fans maintain hope that at least a few of the characters will reach a satisfying, well-deserved ending. That\u2019s why there\u2019s Game of Thrones Hope Chest, a new weekly poll where we put all our hopes together in one place. We aren\u2019t asking what you think is going to happen on Game of Thrones, we\u2019re asking: what do you most hope to see happen?\nOne spoiler ahead for season 7, episode 3, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice\u201d\nThis week, we\u2019re looking at Brandon Stark, who starts Game of Thrones as an overeager kid who likes to climb things, permanently loses the use of his legs in the pilot episode, and spends the next six seasons on an increasingly strange vision quest. Having been hauled all over Westeros by a team of human sled dogs, he finally completed his six-season journey and made it safely back home to Winterfell in last week\u2019s episode, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice.\u201d As he tells his sister Sansa, he\u2019s become the Three-Eyed Raven \u2014 which is to say he has a mystic title now, and the infuriatingly vague, symbolic speech habits to go with it.\nHe also has a wide variety of powers, which have inspired some of the meatiest fan theories in the entire series. (And a rash of \u201cIs Bran Stark the most important character on Game of Thrones?\u201d articles and debates.) He can not only see into the past and the future, he can actually affect things in the past, interfering with time itself. He can possess living creatures, he can see anything happening in the present anywhere, and he can confuse the hell out of people by answering their really sensible questions in the most unhelpful ways possible. He\u2019s probably the only living person in the series who actually knows the secret of Jon Snow\u2019s actual parentage. \nAll of which has given rise to some wild ideas about what he might do before the show is over, either to turn the tide against the Night King (who is aware of him, hunting him, and capable of interacting with his psychic projection), or to bring disaster on the story by bringing some meaningful historical threads together. Every thing on this list is something internet pundits have theorized he might do before the story is over. (Except that last one. That\u2019s just me.)
