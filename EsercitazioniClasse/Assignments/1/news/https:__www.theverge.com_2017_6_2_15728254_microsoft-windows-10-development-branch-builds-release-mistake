{"title": "Microsoft accidentally released internal Windows 10 development builds", "content": " \nMicrosoft was forced to apologize late last night after a mistake led to some confidential and internal Windows 10 builds being released to the public. \u201cBuilds from some of our internal branches were accidentally released for PC and Mobile,\u201d reveals Dona Sarkar, Microsoft\u2019s head of its Windows Insiders program. \u201cThis happened because an inadvertent deployment to the engineering system that controls which builds / which rings to push out to insiders.\u201d\nMicrosoft says it quickly reverted the issue and put blocks in place to ensure these development builds didn\u2019t reach more people, but a \u201csmall portion\u201d of Windows 10 users still received them. Worryingly, the accidental mobile build even reached retail devices outside of Microsoft\u2019s Windows Insiders testing. If Windows 10 testers installed the mobile build it forced phones into a reboot loop and bricked the device. Testers will have to recover and wipe the device using the Windows Device Recovery Tool.\nWindows 10 testers that installed the PC build, an internal Edge branch, will have to wait for Microsoft to publish a newer build or roll back using the recovery option in Windows 10 settings. \u201cWe apologize for this inconvenience and thank you for being a Windows Insider,\u201d says Sarkar. Microsoft says it won\u2019t be releasing any new builds this week, presumably as it\u2019s working to ensure this surprising mistake doesn\u2019t occur again.\n"}
