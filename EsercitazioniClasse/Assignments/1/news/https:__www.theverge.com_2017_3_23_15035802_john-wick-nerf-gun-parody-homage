{"title": "Nerf John Wick might be as badass as movie John Wick", "content": " \nI haven\u2019t even seen John Wick: Chapter 2 yet, but I do know that it involves Keanu Reeves killing lots of people for his dog\u2019s enjoyment. As far as action movies go, that\u2019s hard to top, but \u201cNerf John Wick\u201d might be the perfect parody-slash-homage we never asked for. Here, instead of actual pistols and assault rifles, John is taking out his enemies with the most awesome array of nerf guns imaginable.\nOverall, the short is a mix of badass fight choreography and the ridiculous fun of a Nerf fight. There\u2019s something so funny about a bunch of masked assassins taking on a walking killing machine being undercut by the \u201cplips\u201d you hear anytime someone fires a shot. Of course, catching a Nerf dart in midair and slamming it into an enemy\u2019s head is always awesome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
