Today, Rocket League developer Psyonix revealed two of the Switch-exclusive vehicles that will be featured in the game, both based on iconic Nintendo properties. The first, called the NSR, will come in Mario and Luigi varieties, while the second is styled after Samus\u2019 iconic gunship from Metroid. Both vehicles will be free unlockables.
