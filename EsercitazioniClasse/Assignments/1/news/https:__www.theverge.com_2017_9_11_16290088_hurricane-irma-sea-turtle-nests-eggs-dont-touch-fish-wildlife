{"title": "Hurricane Irma probably dug up some sea turtle nests and you definitely shouldn't touch them", "content": " \nPeople who want to help sea turtle nests battered by Hurricane Irma should leave the eggs and hatchlings alone, wildlife officials say. Instead, call the experts, because good intentions don\u2019t necessarily make for good results. \nSea turtle nests on Florida\u2019s beaches are facing dangerous coastal flooding in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it whirls toward Georgia. But well-meaning humans are sometimes bigger threats than they realize. Remember the bison calf in Yellowstone that tourists tried to \u201crescue\u201d from the cold by putting it in their car? The calf\u2019s herd rejected it after rangers tried to reintroduce it, and the calf was ultimately euthanized. \nThat\u2019s why Fish and Wildlife officials warn that even if receding flood waters leave sea turtle eggs exposed, the concerned public should leave them alone: sea turtles will weather the storm. \n\n\nIf you spot an injured sea turtle or disturbed nest, contact: \n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission at seaturtlestanding@myfwc.com or mtp@myfwc.com\n\nFWC's 24-hour Wildlife Alert Number at 1-888-404-FWCC (1-888-404-3922)\n\nMote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium at 941-388-4331\n\n\n\nFive species of endangered sea turtles lay their eggs on Florida\u2019s beaches between March and October. The females drop 100 or so golf ball-sized eggs into a hole in the sand, then abandon the nest to swim back out to sea. The eggs incubate for about two months before the tiny hatchlings emerge and shuffle en masse to the water \u2014 navigating by light. (Artificial lights can mess with turtle navigation systems.) \nIf a storm hits during nesting season, many of the unhatched eggs could be washed out of their nest and scattered. Nests that are temporarily submerged may still be okay, however, since female sea turtles build the nests to drain well. \nSea turtles also know better than to put all their eggs in one basket, the Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium reports. A female sea turtle lays between five and seven nests each year, boosting her odds that even if some nests are washed out or eaten by predators like raccoons or fire ants, others might still hatch successfully. In 2004, when three hurricanes struck Florida, nearly half of the loggerhead sea turtle nests still hatched, which is a typical success rate, the Fish and Wildlife Service reports. \nThe Mote Sea Turtle Conservation and Research Program documented a record-breaking number of nests this year, but the sea turtles have already had one major storm to contend with. At the beginning of August, Tropical Storm Emily struck Sarasota County, washing the protective, sandy covering away from many sea turtle nests. Some hatchlings were discovered floating in a nearby swimming pool.\nIt\u2019s not just counterproductive to disturb eggs, hatchlings, and injured turtles, either: it\u2019s against the law. Instead, it\u2019s better to call the Mote Marine Laboratory or email the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (see the sidebar). To help the turtles, you\u2019ll want to summon someone who knows how.\n\n\n"}
