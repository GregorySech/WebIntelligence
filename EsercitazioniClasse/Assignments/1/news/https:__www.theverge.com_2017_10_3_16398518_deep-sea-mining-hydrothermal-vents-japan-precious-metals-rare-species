Though the scale of the operation is still unclear, it could be one of the first ventures in what may be a massive deep-ocean mining industry. And that is sparking renewed concerns among scientists about how this new gold rush will affect the unique creatures living off these ore deposits.\nThe Okinawa deposits, located over 5,000 feet below the sea surface, are formed by underwater geysers called hydrothermal vents. These are chimneys on the seafloor that spew out hot plumes rife with zinc, nickel, copper, and other rare elements; when the plumes collide against the cold seawater, the metals fall out and accumulate on the seafloor. There are more than 500 hydrothermal vents all over the world, says deep-sea ecologist Andrew Thaler, and they represent some of the last untapped deposits of precious metals on Earth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mining machine is lowered into the water off the coast of Okinawa to extract minerals from a deep-water seabed.\nPhoto: Agency for Natural Resources and Energy / via Kyodo / The Japan Times\n\n\nAs such, countries and mineral extraction companies all over the world have been gearing up for years to tap into these underwater treasure troves, which hold many of the rare elements key to power our smartphones and computers. The deposit mined by Japan is believed to contain an amount of zinc equivalent to the country\u2019s annual consumption, according to The Japan Times. (Japan consumed 470,121 metric tons of refined zinc in 2014, according to the US Geological Survey.) The ore also includes gold, copper, and lead. \n\u201cthis baby is gonna go.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known that [deep-sea] mining is going to happen for a while now,\u201d says Thaler. Japan\u2019s month-long extraction \u2014 dubbed \u201cthe largest such extraction of its type\u201d by The Japan Times \u2014 is likely still part of an effort to test underwater mining robots rather than a full-blown commercial operation, says Conn Nugent, the director of Pew\u2019s seabed mining project. Still, it\u2019s a step forward in making large-scale seabed mining a reality. \u201cIt does appear that a page has been turned and that this baby is gonna go,\u201d Nugent tells The Verge.\nHydrothermal vents were discovered in the 1970s and have fascinated scientists ever since. Each vent system is unique, with different creatures inhabiting its slopes and feeding off the toxic hydrothermal fluids spewing out into the ocean. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, vents are populated by enormous worms that live inside tubes. Two types of snails live around the hydrothermal vents of the southwestern Pacific: one encased in a whitish shell covered with tiny hairs; the other enveloped in a heavy black shell that \u201calmost looks like body armor,\u201d Thaler says. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, vents are dominated by yeti crabs, so called because they\u2019re completely white and covered in hair. \u201cThere\u2019s so much weird wild stuff,\u201d Thaler says. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing we\u2019ll ever get to actually interacting with alien life.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA yeti crab.\nPhoto by A. Fifis, Ifremer / ChEss, Census of Marine Life\n\n\nBut mining might put this life in peril. Mining the vents involves grinding metal-rich rock into a slurry and sucking it up to ships floating at the surface using gargantuan machines. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it: whatever you're mining, you\u2019re wiping out all the animals that live there,\u201d Thaler says. \nBut hydrothermal vents can be resilient to intrusion: vent systems are very dynamic, turning on and off over the span of decades or even centuries. Thaler says he\u2019s studied hydrothermal vent systems that were completely wiped out by a volcanic eruption, buried by lava, but began spewing out fluids again after about a decade. \u201cThese are ecosystems that can handle occasional catastrophic disruption,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, what level of destruction hydrothermal vents can sustain before they no longer support life \u2014 or whether they can recover. Because hydrothermal vents are relatively recent discoveries, scientists don\u2019t have the answers to all these questions. \u201cIt could be that [mining] is not a big problem, but until we get those measurements we\u2019re not gonna know,\u201d says Cindy Lee Van Dover, a professor at the Division of Marine Science and Conservation at Duke University.\nHydrothermal vents also contain toxic chemicals like lead and arsenic \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear what would happen if mining equipment failed, leading to a spill. Will animals on the seafloor or water column be harmed? What if there\u2019s a spill in waters close to the shore, where people live? Answering those questions falls to the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the United Nations\u2019 independent treaty organization that is tasked with regulating seafloor mining in international waters. \n\u201cThese are ecosystems that can handle occasional catastrophic disruption.\u201d\nThe ISA has granted over 25 contracts to countries \u2014 including Japan \u2014 to explore for minerals. But no large-scale commercial mining operations are taking place just yet, says Nugent. That\u2019s because the ISA is still figuring out how to make sure deep-sea mining is done safely. The agency has committed to develop environmental regulations by 2020 \u2014 which means that we can expect big underwater robots mining hydrothermal vents commercially around 2025, Nugent says. \nFor now, Japan is mining vents in its own coastal waters, called an exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The country\u2019s Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry then plans to commercialize mining at the sites off Okinawa around the middle of 2020, according to The Japan Times. That would fit with the timeline given by Nugent. \u201cIf any ISA member state were to conduct large-scale commercial seabed mining within its own EEZ without waiting for the production of the ISA environmental code, that would have diplomatic repercussions,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure that any member state would want to run that risk.\u201d\n\u201cThe deep sea is our outer space.\u201d\nRegardless of what Japan\u2019s doing in its own waters, hydrothermal vents \u2014 and other underwater mineral deposits \u2014 in the high seas will be opened to mining soon. And the scientific community will be weighing in to determine how to do it best. At stake is one of the most unique ecosystems on our planet. Globally, active vents are estimated to cover about 34 square miles, less than 1 percent of the area of Yellowstone National Park, Lee Van Dover says \u2014 they\u2019re very rare. But also very understudied. Deep-sea animals have yielded big discoveries before, including one small organism that contains a compound that could help treat Alzheimer\u2019s. Maybe hydrothermal vents host communities of organisms that may yield the next big drug. And, Thaler says, we should protect them for their own right: these weird, deep-sea creatures exist in pure darkness amidst toxic chemicals that\u2019d be fatal to most animals.\n\u201cThe deep sea is our outer space,\u201d Thaler says, \u201cbut it\u2019s an outer space that\u2019s just full of living things that totally challenge our perception of what it means to be alive.\u201d\nUpdate November 7th, 2017: This story was originally published on October 3rd, 2017; it\u2019s been updated to include video.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
