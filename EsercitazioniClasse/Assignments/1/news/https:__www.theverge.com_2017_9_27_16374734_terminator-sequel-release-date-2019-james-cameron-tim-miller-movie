{"title": "Terminator will return in 2019 with the help of James Cameron", "content": " \nThe Terminator franchise is officially coming back. According to Variety, Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller will direct the film, with Terminator 2 director James Cameron returning as a producer. The untitled sequel will hit theaters on July 26th, 2019.\nCameron\u2019s return to the franchise is certainly a move aimed at revitalizing it after a series of ill-advised sequels such as 2009\u2019s Terminator: Salvation and 2015\u2019s nostalgia-driven Terminator Genisys. Both films were attempts to reboot the series, which ultimately fizzled with critics and audiences. \nRumors of the \u201creboot and conclusion\u201d to the franchise surfaced earlier this year, with word that Cameron would be returning, with Miller attached to direct. It remains to be seen what the timing will mean for another one of Miller\u2019s announced projects about artificial intelligence, an adaptation of William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer. \nCameron says that \u2018Terminator\u2019 is more important than ever\nCameron was convinced to return to the franchise by Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, who pointed to a new era of \u201cAmazon drones, Facebook news bots, and artificial intelligence-fueled anxiety,\u201d according to a report in The Hollywood Reporter. Cameron goes on to note that the films are more important than ever, because \u201cthe machines have already won,\u201d judging from the amount of time people spend on their phones. Both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton will return for the film, which will be used as an opportunity to hand the story off to a new generation of stars.\nIf that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because the same model was used by Lucasfilm and Disney to reboot the entire Star Wars franchise with 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens. Cameron says that the new Terminator story will be a continuation of the first two films \u2014 which he directed \u2014 and that they\u2019re \u201cpretending that the other films were a bad dream.\u201d \nThat would make the film a sort of cinematic reset button, similar to what Neill Blomkamp\u2019s proposed Alien 5 project had intended to do, that would allow Paramount to jump in on the extended cinematic universe trend that has been driving so much major studio business as of late. Indeed, the film\u2019s 2019 release date brings yet another enormous blockbuster sequel to an already crowded summer schedule. While Star Wars: Episode IX has since been moved to December, Toy Story 4, Spiderman: Homecoming 2, The Lion King, Captain Marvel, and the fourth, untitled Avengers movie are all scheduled to arrive in theaters that summer. \n\n"}
