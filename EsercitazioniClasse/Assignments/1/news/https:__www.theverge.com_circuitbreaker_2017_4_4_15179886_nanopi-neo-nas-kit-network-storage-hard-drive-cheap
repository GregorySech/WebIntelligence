{"title": "Build a miniature NAS out of a NanoPi NEO with this simple kit", "content": " \nThe NanoPi NEO is an $8 version of the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero built by a company called FriendlyARM that launched last summer. Except the NanoPi NEO has the added advantage of usually being in stock to purchase (something that the Pi Zero has had difficulties with in the past).\nTo go along with the miniature computer, the company is releasing an add-on kit that converts the NanoPi NEO into a 1-bay NAS (via Liliputing). But what\u2019s impressive about the NanoPi NEO NAS kit \u2014 aside from its diminutive size \u2014 is the price, which comes out to $12.99. (Although you\u2019ll also need a power adaptor, sold separately for $9.89, and a 2.5-inch SATA hard drive to actually put inside the storage bay, just like any other NAS.) \nStill, even considering the price of everything together, you\u2019re getting a completely open-source NAS that can run Linux and is about the size of a large smartphone for just over $30. This is a pretty price if you\u2019re looking for a quick-and-simple NAS solution.\n"}
