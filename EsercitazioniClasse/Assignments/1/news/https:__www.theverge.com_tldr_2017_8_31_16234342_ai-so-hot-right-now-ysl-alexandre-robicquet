{"title": "AI is so hot right now researchers are posing for Yves Saint Laurent", "content": " \nThe AI community has been abuzz today on Twitter after one of its own was elevated in an unusual fashion. Stanford University grad Alexandre Robicquet is a researcher in machine vision who works in the lab of Google X founder Sebastian Thrun. But he\u2019s also helping front a new Yves Saint Laurent ad campaign, with his face \u2014 and profession \u2014 popping up in posters and photoshoots. Artificial intelligence? It\u2019s so hot right now. \nThe campaign itself is for a new fragrance dubbed Y, and in a 30-second TV spot posted online today, Robicquet is seen riding a motorbike, delivering some sort of talk to a rapturous audience, and, yes, even doing a bit of coding. (For like two seconds.) Even the slogan is AI-appropriate: \u201cEverything starts with a why.\u201d \n\n\nThe hype of being an AI research scientist nowadays. pic.twitter.com/karJtj6yIG\u2014 Antoine MIECH (@antoine77340) August 30, 2017\n\n\n\nRobicquet is actually one of three faces fronting the new campaign, alongside rapper Loyle Carner and sculptor David Alexander Flinn. Of course, no one is saying he was chosen for the role just because he works in AI, and at the end of the day he is only one guy. (One very attractive guy, it goes without saying.) But it seems at least a little bit culturally significant that working in this once-geeky and obscure field now has enough cultural cachet to give a high-end perfume an air of mystique.\nMark Riedl, an associate professor at Georgia Tech who works with AI and storytelling and tweeted about the campaign, says it does seem like part of a wider trend. \u201cI think we are starting to see awareness of AI and machine learning creep into broader cultural awareness,\u201d Riedl tells The Verge. \u201cWith all the press (negative and positive) surrounding AI in the press, there is a general level of awareness of AI that we haven\u2019t before.\u201d Although he adds: \u201cThis may be a one-off \u2014 basically an attractive man who also happens to work on AI.\u201d\n\n\nSure, your arXiv paper is highly cited. But are you the face of a new fragrance? https://t.co/ragJSj7cgv\u2014 Mark Riedl (@mark_riedl) August 31, 2017\n\n\n\nIt seems, perhaps, that \u201cAI researcher\u201d might become something akin to that movie cliche of the lonely male architect; a profession that screenwriters believe is shorthand for intelligence, creativity, and sensitivity. As Cracked puts it, architects are beloved by the movie biz because they seem to combine \u201cthe passion and creativity of an artist [with] the \u2018groundedness\u2019 of a businessman.\u201d Working in AI conveys some of the same signals, as well as a sprinkling of that typically-21st-century archetype: the visionary tech founder. \nRobicquet\u2019s commercial certainly hits all of these themes, but, I think, AI has further to go. Wait until someone starts chatting about recurrent neural nets and backpropagation in a Hollywood rom-com. Then we\u2019ll know AI has really gone mainstream. \n"}
