{"title": "Apple joined by Foxconn and others in its fight with Qualcomm", "content": " \nA group of Taiwanese manufacturers are joining Apple\u2019s legal battle against Qualcomm in a countersuit, claiming the chipmaker charges excessive fees for patent licenses and violates anti-trust laws, according to The Wall Street Journal. Apple is covering the legal expenses associated with the companies\u2019 defense, and said it would file a separate motion to consolidate the manufacturer\u2019s countersuit with its own.\nContract manufacturers Foxconn Technology, Compal Electronics, Pegatron Corp, and Wistron Corp had planned to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm in the Federal District Court in San Diego on Tuesday night. Notably, the companies assemble iPhones and iPads for Apple. Qualcomm is the market leader in smartphone modems and a primary supplier to Apple, yet Apple doesn\u2019t have a direct patent deal with Qualcomm; it pays licensing fees to the four manufacturers who then pay Qualcomm. Apple stopped making payments to the four after it sued Qualcomm in January for $1 billion, thus making the manufacturers\u2019 involvement in the legal tussle seemingly inevitable. \nExcessive patent licences\nIt\u2019s the latest episode in a long and sordid saga. In May, Qualcomm sued the four Taiwanese manufacturers for \u201cfailing to provide royalty payments.\u201d In July, Qualcomm asked the US government to ban new iPhones from coming into the country, and stop sales of devices that were already in the US.\nQualcomm is also being sued by the United States Federal Trade Commission for anti-competitive practices. Qualcomm had previously said that it has \u201cnever withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms,\u201d despite accusations to the contrary by Apple and now others.\n"}
