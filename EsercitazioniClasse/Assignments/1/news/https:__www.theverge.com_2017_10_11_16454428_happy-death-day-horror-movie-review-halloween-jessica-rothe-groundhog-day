{"title": "Happy Death Day is a cynical, stupid-fun 13 Going on 30, but with murder", "content": " \nThis fall, The Verge is making a choice. The choice is fear! We\u2019ve decided to embrace the season by taking in as many new horror movies as possible and reporting back on which ones are worth your time. We\u2019re calling this series Hold My Hand, as we look at films you might want to watch with a supportive viewing partner. Get comfortable, put the kettle on, check the closet for ghosts, then find a hand to squeeze until the bones pop.\nWhat do you want from a horror movie? Is it horror? Genuine horror? If so, I don\u2019t know, just look at the world around you instead. Because today, we\u2019re here to discuss a horror movie that\u2019s secretly about joy. \nHappy Death Day is the latest Blumhouse production, directed by Christopher B. Landon (best known for the later Paranormal Activity movies, but his debut was 2007\u2019s incredible Disturbia), and written by Scott Lobdell (a Marvel Comics staff writer). Jessica Rothe (one of the charming and generous gal pals from La La Land!) plays Tree \u2014 short for Theresa, I assume and hope \u2014 a beautiful, rude sorority girl who keeps dying on her birthday. The bulk of the movie is Tree living the same day over and over, storming out of the dorm room of a doofy stranger named Carter (The Bling Ring\u2019s Israel Broussard), rejecting a red velvet cupcake from her roommate (Shameless\u2019 Ruby Modine), ignoring a birthday phone call from her dad, laughing along with her cruel sorority sisters at lunch, then watching a little bit of Teen Mom before heading off to her surprise party. At 9:30PM, without fail, she\u2019s murdered by an undodgeable hooded weirdo in a baby mask. \nThe birthday-cake-leaking-blood posters for Happy Death Day have been ubiquitous in New York for months, making me feel a weird combination of \u201chungry for cake\u201d and \u201ceager to see a movie about cake,\u201d but also \u201cembarrassed, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to find a blood cake appealing in this way.\u201d This marketing campaign proved itself appropriate, as the corresponding film does involve cake, and I was almost embarrassed by how much I loved it.\n\nIs it scary? \nIt\u2019s hard to be too scared by a PG-13 horror movie with a heroine so charming, you know she\u2019ll survive. But knowing you\u2019re going to see her abruptly die at least half a dozen different unpredictable ways first does provoke a sick kind of dread. One particular death (not Tree\u2019s) crushed my fluttery little heart like it was a kitten hiding in the wheel-well of my mom\u2019s minivan. \nI recommend bringing a comforting snack to this film, but not cake. I ate pretzel M&Ms, for example, and that was a good choice. \nWill I care about the characters? \nYes! Jessica Rothe should be in the next crop of regular teen-movie heroines, and should get very rich. Her comedic timing is disarming, and she\u2019s at least as expressive and elastic as Easy A-era Emma Stone. Though Tree is supposed to be an unbearable jerk, I loved her within about 14 minutes. \nthe world needed a \u201813 going on 30\u2019 tribute\nThe structural conceit of Happy Death Day is obviously borrowed from Groundhog Day \u2014 which gets a hat tip in the movie\u2019s final scene \u2014 but it actually has a lot more in common with the 2004 Jennifer Garner gem 13 Going on 30. In that film, Garner\u2019s character is stuck in a time-warp until she figures out how to be less shallow, mean, and self-centered. Like Tree, she responds to her displacement by hatching weird plans, finding comedy in her absurd situation, and flopping around like her limbs are made of Silly Putty. Happy Death Day is actually a more generous film, though, in that it gives Tree a full backstory and a secret, horrible grief that explains how she became the insufferable person she is at the start of the film. \nThere\u2019s even one diner scene that I\u2019m pretty sure is a direct callback to Garner\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not a good person\u201d speech in 2004, and it\u2019s moving enough to make me tear up in the middle of a campy teen horror-comedy made on such a shoestring budget, you can almost always see patches of cover-up on the actors\u2019 chins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Universal Pictures\n\n\nIs it visually impressive? \nNo, but who cares? Neither was Bring It On. \nWhat\u2019s lurking beneath the surface? \nWell, honestly not much. This is a silly, weird movie in which you hear the recurring punchline \u201cNice one, dickhead,\u201d no less than eight times. There\u2019s maybe, maybe something to be said about how often the young women in this movie play into the hammy misogyny of their college environment by calling each other sluts, whores, and dumb bitches, but I\u2019d rather take it at face value, as a sleepover movie with a few overly cynical jokes and a buoyant breakout performance from a compelling lead.  \nSadly, Happy Death Day may not have the same sleepover staying power as 13 Going on 30. Where Jennifer Garner\u2019s character got a triumphant come-up sequence set to \u201cThriller,\u201d a swoony love montage paired with Liz Phair\u2019s \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I?,\u201d and an emotional climax that I still think about once a week, involving Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cVienna,\u201d Tree\u2019s biggest moment is set to all three and a half minutes of Demi Lovato\u2019s deeply obnoxious \u201cConfident.\u201d No disrespect to Demi, who has made more hits than I\u2019ve eaten pieces of cake, but this song \u2014 especially in the context of a movie for teens \u2014 has the general effect of being slapped across the mouth with a \u201cNevertheless, She Persisted\u201d mug. Give me some credit: I believe this girl is powerful, I\u2019ve already seen her bounce back from five murders! \nOh well. What\u2019s lurking beneath the surface of this ruthlessly violent horror movie is a glimmer of gold. Happy Death Day is fun enough to be worth watching. It has a wildly dumb twist made forgivable by a punchline about Crocs. It deploys some wonky narrative tricks that expose a debt to A Nightmare on Elm Street, and it barely mentions Bill Murray. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Universal Pictures\n\n\nHow can I watch it? \nHappy Death Day opens in wide release on October 13th. (It\u2019s a Friday. Spooky!)\nIs it a hand-holding movie?\nSure, why not? Please take a nice acquaintance with clean-looking fingernails to the movies with you and see if some hand-holding happens organically. If it doesn\u2019t, just try again the next day with someone else. And again the next day, and the next day, and the next day. I do not want to spoil how many tries it will take you to find happiness, but you are going to be in that theater for a while. It\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll have fun.\n"}
