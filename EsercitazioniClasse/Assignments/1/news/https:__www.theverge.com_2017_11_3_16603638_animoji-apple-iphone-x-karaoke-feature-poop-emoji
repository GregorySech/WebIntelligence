 Among the many normal new features of the iPhone X is the addition of Animoji — all your favorite emoji, but synced up to reenact facial movements like a Snapchat filter on steroids. It’s hard for me to fathom why anyone would want to use these terrifying things. Or, it was until FastCompany tech editor Harry McCracken introduced my Twitter timeline to “Animoji Karaoke.”It’s pretty simple: you record yourself lip-syncing with your favorite emoji to your song of choice, like Sisqo’s “The Thong Song” or Smash Mouth’s “All Star.” My horror has momentarily been suspended to enjoy this foxy rendition of “Bohemian Rhapsody.”Here's hoping Animoji karaoke becomes a thing. pic.twitter.com/oR8PXkRbff— Harry McCracken    (@harrymccracken) November 1, 2017The iPhone X is slowly making its way into more users’ hands, which means it’s time to start planning your favorite combination now.I made an #animoji #karaoke #iPhoneX pic.twitter.com/W8IjPfSFiD— Popadom Priest (@GeriatricGamer) November 3, 2017Groove is in the Animoji pic.twitter.com/3UVzp032yI— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) November 3, 2017my animoji karaoke genuinely looks constipated    pic.twitter.com/D3z28B9i6J— Jason Yuan (@JasonYuanDesign) November 3, 2017“No Roots” by @AliceMerton — Animoji karaoke as inspired by @HarryMcCracken pic.twitter.com/Tfz7992WHN— Alexsander Akers (@a2) November 3, 2017McCracken has already upped the challenge level with his multi-Animoji version of that song from Guardians of the Galaxy, but there’s still plenty of room for full choir runs.
