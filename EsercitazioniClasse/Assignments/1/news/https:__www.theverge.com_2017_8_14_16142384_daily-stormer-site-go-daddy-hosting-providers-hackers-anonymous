{"title": "Neo-nazi site Daily Stormer threatened by hosting providers and possible hackers", "content": " \nNeo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer has been given 24 hours to move its domain to a new host after its current provider, GoDaddy, said it would cut off support. The decision was made in response to a Daily Stormer article about Heather Heyer, who was killed during the Charlottesville protests this weekend. In a statement sent to TechCrunch, GoDaddy said the article \u201ccould incite additional violence\u201d and thus violated the company\u2019s terms of service. \nHeyer, 32, was part of a group of counter-protestors marching against the white nationalists, and was struck and killed when a car plowed into another car, according to The New York Times.  The offending post on the Daily Stormer was written by the site\u2019s editor, Andrew Anglin, as part of its coverage of the Charlottesville protests this weekend. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: The Daily Stormer\n\n\n\n\nWe informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.\u2014 GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) August 14, 2017\n\n\n\nIt also appears that hackers, who claim to be from Anonymous, have taken over the Daily Stormer website, saying they plan to shut it down within 24 hours. The hackers claim to have been targeting the site for months, but took action because of the Charlottesville protests. \n\u201cFor too long, the Daily Stormer and Andrew Anglin have spewed their putrid hate on this site. That will not be happening anymore,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe will allow the site to remain online for 24 hours so the world can witness the hate. Then we will shut it down permanently.\u201d\nA tweet sent out by popular Anonymous account YourAnonNews, said there was no confirmation that the group was involved. The account has previously been associated with the hacking collective, and it questioned whether or not the apparent takeover of the Daily Stormer website was a hoax perpetrated by its owners.\nAnglin founded the Daily Stormer in 2013 and endorsed Donald Trump for president last year. Over the weekend, he praised Trump\u2019s reaction to the Charlottesville protests, saying: \u201cWhen asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.\u201d The hackers claim to have details on Anglin\u2019s whereabouts, and said they would send allies to to \u201cpay him a visit.\u201d Anglin has claimed to be living in Lagos, Nigeria, but previous reports have suggested this too might be a hoax. \nThe hackers said they plan to publish server data from Daily Stormer when the \u201ctime is right,\u201d but did not specify what kind of information this might include. \u201cWe want you Nazis to know: your time is short,\u201d they wrote.\n"}
