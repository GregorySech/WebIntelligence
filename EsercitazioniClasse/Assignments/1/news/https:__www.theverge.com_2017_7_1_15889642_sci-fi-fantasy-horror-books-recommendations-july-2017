{"title": "16 science fiction, fantasy, and horror books to read this July", "content": " \nIt\u2019s July. I\u2019m a little stunned at how fast 2017 has been passing us by. Half the year is gone already! A ton of really fantastic books have come out in those first six months, and if you\u2019ve got vacation planned for this summer, it\u2019ll be a good time to catch up before the back half of the year.\nGiven that the Fourth of July is in a couple of days, it had me thinking about stories that deal explicitly with patriotism and the founding of the country, and I remembered a graphic novel that I read recently: Rebels: A Well-Regulated Militia by Brian Wood. It\u2019s a really fantastic story set in 1775, just before the colonies declared their independence from Great Britain.\nThe comic follows a young man named Seth Abbott and his wife Mercy as they settle in the frontier and deal with the challenges of living in the forests of what would eventually become Vermont. Seth joins the ongoing rebellion, and takes part in conflicts such as the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. It\u2019s a complicated, nuanced tale about duty and survival, and I\u2019d recommend looking it up. A second series, Rebels: These Free And Independent States began hitting stores in March. \nHere are 16 books coming out this month that you should also check out. \nJuly 4th\nDichronauts by Greg Egan\nGreg Egan is known for some spectacular science fiction novels in recent years, and his latest looks pretty out there.

Otherwise, they\u2019ll get distorted across the landscape. A surveyor named Seth joins an expedition to the edge of inhabitable space, where they discover an unimaginable fissure in the world \u2014 one that will stop the ongoing migration of its inhabitants. The only way forward is down, to try and find a way to save everyone. \nHeroine Worship by Sarah Kuhn\nIn this sequel to Sarah Kuhn\u2019s Heroine Complex, Aveda Jupiter was once San Francisco\u2019s most beloved superheroine. Now, her life is in a bit of a free fall since she and her assistant Evie got rid of all the demons that inhabited the city. Her friends are turning on her, and now that her assistant gained powers, she\u2019s finding herself in the sidekick role, something that she really doesn\u2019t want. When Evie becomes engaged and supernatural beings begin to attack brides in the city, Aveda sees a chance to regain her former glory by making sure her friend\u2019s wedding goes off without a hitch, and by saving the city. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Angry Robot Books\n\n\nAn Oath of Dogs by Wendy Wagner \nSet on the distant, forested planet of Huginn, Kate Standish begins to think that someone has murdered her boss.
