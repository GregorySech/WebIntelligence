{"title": "A Venmo scammer has stolen $25,000 in expensive camera gear in LA", "content": " \nThe staggered payouts were the first clue something was wrong.\nRasa was selling his camera \u2014 a Blackmagic URSA Mini 4.6K, priced down to $4,300 \u2014 and had found a buyer on Facebook Marketplace. The buyer said his name was Andy Mai, and wanted to pay with Venmo. Rasa, who asked not to reveal his last name, thought the payment method was strange, but not a deal-breaker. \nWhen the money finally came in, however, it came in $80 or $90 installments. Mai sent 52 total transactions, each under $100. Rasa wasn\u2019t sure how to respond \u2014 but weird or not, the money was in his account. So when the buyer showed up, as agreed, outside his apartment in East Hollywood, he couldn\u2019t think of a good reason to stop the deal. He handed over the camera and set the money to transfer to his bank account, figuring it was as safe as cash in his wallet.\n\u201cThey've created a platform for criminals.\u201d\nThe next day, he realized his mistake. Roughly 15 hours after he made the handoff, Venmo froze his account, asking him to verify his identity and reach out to local law enforcement. The transfer was blocked, and it soon became clear Rasa would never get his money. When he reached out to Venmo, customer service informed him he had broken Venmo\u2019s user policy by receiving money in exchange for goods, and his account was officially suspended.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a merchant,\u201d Rasa told The Verge. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camera-selling business. This is the first camera I\u2019ve sold in six months.\u201d \nTwelve days later in Ventura County, another video pro named Brendan was hit with a similar scam. He had listed a Sony DSLR with a set of lenses worth $7,500, and when he arrived at a local Starbucks for the handoff, he got the same suspicious string of transactions. The buyer, again, was Andy Mai, although Mai had sent a friend to pick up the lenses. The next day, Brendan\u2019s Venmo account was suspended, and his equipment was gone.\nAs Brendan and Rasa shared their story with other videographers, they found as many as 20 people who had fallen prey to the same scam over the course of two weeks. The group running the scam targeted victims on Facebook Marketplace, seeking out video pros in the LA area and insisting on Venmo payments to ensure a clean getaway. The person who showed up to pick up the goods varied, as did the Venmo account used \u2014 but the payment always came from an account with \u201cAndy Mai\u201d in the name, suggesting a single group behind all the scams. Each time one account got blocked, another account with a new variant of the name sprung up, ready for a new victim.\n\u201cWe strongly caution Venmo users to avoid payments with people they don't know.\u201d\nConsumer groups have been warning about similar scams since October, but this latest string of thefts has reached a remarkable scale. The Verge was able to verify four victims whose losses added up to $25,000 \u2014 although if all of Rasa\u2019s reports are accurate, the total losses could be as high as $100,000.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly why Rasa and Brendan\u2019s accounts were frozen, but it\u2019s likely that, one way or another, they were being paid with stolen money. When money is transferred from a stolen debit card or another compromised account, the standard response for money-transfer services like Venmo is often to freeze the funds so they can be returned to the rightful owner. In Rasa and Brendan\u2019s case, that would have meant clawing back the money while the scammer made off with the goods.\nIf that\u2019s what happened, the \u201cAndy Mai\u201d scammers would have found a new solution to a classic criminal problem: how to turn financial data into hard cash. Stolen debit card information routinely circulates on underground marketplaces, but the return on investment can vary greatly. Banks usually spot unauthorized withdrawals within 24 hours, and ATM limits cap conventional withdrawals at $200 per card. Criminals have found all sorts of creative schemes to raise those rates, and it\u2019s possible that Mai was using Venmo and Facebook Marketplace as a way to squeeze more cash out of each card.\nReached by The Verge, a Venmo representative highlighted the dangers of transactions with strangers. \u201cVenmo is designed for payments between friends and people who trust each other,\u201d the representative wrote. \u201cWe strongly caution Venmo users to avoid payments with people they don't know, especially if it involves the sale for goods and services (like event tickets and Craigslist items). These payments are potentially high risk, and can result in losing your money without getting what you paid for.\u201d The company also emphasized its ongoing efforts to fight fraud on the system, which alert senders if there are indications that a particular transaction might violate the terms of service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a tip for us?

Users must confirm transactions out of their own wallets, and a suspicious description will often trigger a hold on the money. Unfortunately for Rasa and Brendan, there are few equivalent protections for users receiving money. There are no warnings indicating an incoming payment might be fraudulent, and in most cases, no way to halt a suspicious transaction as it comes in.\nBrendan says if he\u2019d known how easily the money in his account could be recalled, he never would have used Venmo for his transaction. He points to the service\u2019s help page, where Venmo describes payments \u201clike cash in a wallet.\u201d That language, he says, gave him a false sense of security.\n\u201cThe main issue I have with this entire situation is that Venmo knows this is happening, but they're doing nothing,\u201d Brendan told The Verge. \u201cThey've created a platform for criminals, and are placing the blame on their legitimate users, despite the incredibly misleading information on their website.\u201d\nIt\u2019s particularly disconcerting since Mai seems to have had more credit than the average Venmo user. In Brendan\u2019s case, the scammer was able to send up to $3,000 before switching accounts \u2014 far beyond the standard $200 limit. Venmo users can only reach that limit after verifying their account, providing the company with a zip code, birthday, and the last four digits of their Social Security number, along with other documents in some cases. But with Mai running as many as six accounts at a time \u2014 and routinely being shut down for fraud \u2014 it\u2019s unclear how he was able to keep the scam going for so long.\nFor Rasa, that verification is one of the most puzzling aspects of Mai\u2019s scheme. \u201cIt just seems like such a blind eye,\u201d he told The Verge.\nIn some ways, robust anti-fraud protections cut against Venmo\u2019s unique advantage among payment services. Unlike eBay or conventional transaction methods, Venmo doesn\u2019t exact a charge for transferring money. Those fees are typically justified as covering protections against fraud, an unnecessary expense if you\u2019re only handling small transactions between friends. But it also means Venmo can\u2019t support the anti-fraud services that have become standard for credit cards and online payment services.\nStill, many Venmo users may not have grasped that a simpler, easier service may translate to less protection from fraud. As much as the service claims to warn users away from merchant transactions, Rasa still feels misled. \u201cVenmo\u2019s really playing the game of, \u2018let\u2019s be the easiest thing to do,\u2019\u201d Rasa says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really safe.\u201d\n\n"}
