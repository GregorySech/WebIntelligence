{"title": "Pebble and Essential designer Liron Damir joins Google to work on Home products", "content": " \nLiron Damir, Pebble\u2019s former VP of design and one of the leaders behind creating webOS for HP and LG, is heading to Google to serve as the new head of UX for Google Home, via Variety. Per Damir\u2019s announcement on LinkedIn, he\u2019ll be \u201clead[ing] the design of Google Home products,\u201d in his new role at the company. \nDamir\u2019s hire makes sense for Google\nDamir leaves his position at Andy Rubin\u2019s Essential, where he had served as head of UX for the startup\u2019s upcoming phone (and presumably, Essential\u2019s Ambient OS project). Between his previous experience developing webOS for TVs, his time at Pebble, and his work at Essential, Damir\u2019s hire makes sense for Google, especially as the company begins to build out more visual user experience interactions with Home. \nOn the flip side of things, it\u2019s hard to see this as good news for Essential, which just lost a crucial part of its design team before it managed to launch either the Essential Phone or the Ambient OS-running smart speaker.  \nAt Google I/O this year, Google showed off how a connected Chromecast could be used as a visual screen for displaying relevant information from a Google Home, and with the launch of Amazon\u2019s Echo Show, it\u2019s easy to imagine that Google could be looking for further opportunities to build out an ecosystem of more interactive Home products. \n"}
