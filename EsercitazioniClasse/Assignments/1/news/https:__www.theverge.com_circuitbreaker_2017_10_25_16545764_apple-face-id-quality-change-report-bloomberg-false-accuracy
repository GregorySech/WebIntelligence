{"title": "Apple calls Face ID quality change report \u2018completely false\u2019", "content": " \nApple is calling into contention an earlier report from Bloomberg that claimed the company had lowered the accuracy of the face recognition in order to increase iPhone X production yields, calling the report \u201ccompletely false\u201d in a statement to The Verge. \nThe full statement from Apple elaborates that 1,000,000:1 accuracy it had originally announced is still valid. Depending on how you want to read the statement, it is possible that Bloomberg\u2019s original report \u2014 which said that Apple had lowered quality specifications to allow components to be produced faster \u2014 is also correct, and that Apple is using careful wording here when referring to the \u201caccuracy\u201d of the sensor, which could remain the same, even if overall part quality control was reduced. \nAn earlier report by The Wall Street Journal noted that the Face ID sensor modules were causing production issues that could limit supply. \nThe full statement by Apple is below:\n\nCustomer excitement for iPhone X and Face ID has been incredible, and we can\u2019t wait for customers to get their hands on it starting Friday, November 3. Face ID is a powerful and secure authentication system that\u2019s incredibly easy and intuitive to use. The quality and accuracy of Face ID haven\u2019t changed. It continues to be 1 in a million probability of a random person unlocking your iPhone with Face ID.\nBloomberg\u2019s claim that Apple has reduced the accuracy spec for Face ID is completely false and we expect Face ID to be the new gold standard for facial authentication.\n\n\n"}
