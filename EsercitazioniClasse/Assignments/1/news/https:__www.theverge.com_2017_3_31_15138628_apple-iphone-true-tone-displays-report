{"title": "Apple may bring True Tone displays to the next iPhones", "content": " \nApple\u2019s next iPhones may feature True Tone displays, according to a note from Barclays, as reported by MacRumors. Currently, Apple\u2019s True Tone display is only available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. \nTrue Tone displays can alter the appearance of the screen based on the lighting conditions. So when you\u2019re in a room with yellow bulbs or outside in sunlight, your display will look different \u2014 and be easier on the eyes. \nTrue Tone is similar to Night Shift in some ways, but Night Shift is solely designed to limit the amount of blue light you take in during evening hours, not as a 24-hour solution.\nBarclays says True Tone will be available on all three of Apple\u2019s iPhones, which it\u2019s referring to as the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and iPhone 8. Hopefully that naming structure isn\u2019t the case, or it\u2019ll make for a very confusing fall. \n"}
