{"title": "Watch the return of the internet\u2019s weirdest genre: flopping rubber bodies", "content": " \nRubber humans are my favorite kind of non-living entity. They possess all the physical joy of the human form and none of the existential baggage! And when lumped together, they become something bordering on transcendent: a squishy, satisfying mess of naked, flapping body parts that makes QWOP look tame. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201crubber human bodies\u201d has become something of its own web video genre.\nFilmmaker David Lewandowski is, arguably, the grandfather of the form. Five years ago, he released Going to the Store, a short about a naked rubber man doing his grocery shopping. The sequel, Late for Meeting, released three years ago, flailed its way straight into my heart. Now Lewandowski has another, more ambitious short film to share: Time for Sushi.\nAt last, the ocean beckons the gelatin flesh. \nSpeaking from personal experience, prolonged exposure to water may cause a Ken doll\u2019s features to fade or his skin to peel. But Lewandowski\u2019s digitally crafted bodies have nothing to fear. They are free and beautiful, like the final artifacts of humanity, forever drifting long after the waters rise above us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
