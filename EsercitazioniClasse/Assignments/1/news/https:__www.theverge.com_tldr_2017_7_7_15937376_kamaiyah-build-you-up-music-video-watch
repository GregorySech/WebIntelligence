{"title": "One Video: Build You Up by Kamaiyah", "content": " \nEvery week, a slew of new music videos hits the web. Watching them at your desk is not time theft because you deserve it; think of it as a nice reward for surviving another work week. But what if you don\u2019t have time to watch every video \u2014 maybe you have a deadline, a hungry pet, or other grown-up concerns. In consideration of your schedule, Lizzie and Kaitlyn bring you a series called One Video. Each week we\u2019ll tell you \u201cone video\u201d you need to watch, why, and for how long.\nThis week\u2019s video: \u201cBuild You Up\u201d by Kamaiyah\nLizzie: This week\u2019s video had to battle for the ultra-coveted One Video spot with an animated Lil Yachty lyric video, a strange, boring Vic Mensa clip (sup with you, Vic?), and a new All-American Rejects video, by the band All-American Rejects who you might remember from 2005.\nIn \u201cBuild You Up,\u201d Kamaiyah befriends a forlorn-looking woman on the train, buys her pizza, and takes her to a party. If you\u2019ve learned nothing else from your favorite internet column, you know we love a good day-to-night tale of friendship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaitlyn: All true, and Kamaiyah also beat out 20-year-old Norwegian pop star Sigrid, who released a video for her song \u201cPlot Twist\u201d today. Sigrid is a friend of Lorde\u2019s, or at least someone Lorde sometimes includes on personal playlists, and so Sigrid is a friend of mine. Or at least someone I include on my personal playlists. It\u2019s a good song! Kamaiyah\u2019s is better, and so here we are. Another thing you might know if you\u2019ve followed this column even casually is that choreographed dancing goes a long way with Kaitlyn and Lizzie. This video has more than one choreographed dance.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Kamaiyah?\nLizzie: Kamaiyah is a rapper from Oakland who signed to Interscope after dropping her very very excellent 2016 mixtape A Good Night in the Ghetto. \u201cBuild You Up\u201d is the first track off her upcoming mixtape Don\u2019t Ever Get It Twisted, which was supposed to come out in May, but has been pushed back a few times. Hopefully this video means we won\u2019t be waiting much longer. \nKaitlyn: If you haven\u2019t heard Kamaiyah\u2019s mixtape, it\u2019s possible you know her from \u201cAll Around Me,\u201d a song on Lil Yachty\u2019s debut album Teenage Emotions, which came out last month. She and YG, another California rapper, contribute some pretty good verses to an otherwise uninteresting tune. \nShe and Drake also had verses on \u201cWhy You Always Hatin?\u201d from YG\u2019s 2016 album Still Brazy, so maybe you heard that one. If not, well, she\u2019s the woman in this music video. She is 24 years old.\nif we threw a one video pizza party would you come?\nWhat\u2019s special about \u201cBuild You Up\u201d by Kamaiyah:\nLizzie:  What\u2019s special about this video is the very good outfits (primary color visors and matching socks, see-through rain jackets, canary yellow jumpsuits) and the way Kamaiyah and her crew just kind of take over the city of Oakland and convince everyone around them to have a good time. \nKaitlyn: I made a GIF of the sad train lady\u2019s raincoat because the first time Lizzie and I watched this video Lizzie said, \u201cWow, I love her jacket,\u201d and then pointed at the jacket and said, \u201cWow, what a good jacket.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty nice jacket, though it\u2019s also an unfortunate reminder that yes, it is raining in New York City right now and I too had to wear a rain jacket this morning. Mine isn\u2019t as nice. It says \u201cBloomfield Soccer\u201d on it.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video is special because of the rain jacket, which so far seems like the best thing that happened to Lizzie today. \nLizzie: It was and is.\nHow long everyone should watch \u201cBuild You Up\u201d by Kamaiyah:\nLizzie: Definitely watch the choreographed dancing from 1:20 to 1:40 and 2:30 to 2:50. \nKaitlyn: I think my favorite part is near the beginning when Kamaiyah is saying stuff like \u201cYou don't need no one, you've got to love yourself\u201d and the screen starts to glitch. I love it when sheer positivity nearly breaks computers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we threw a One Video pizza party would you come? Not today, because it\u2019s raining and some of us don\u2019t have cool raincoats, but another time? \n"}
