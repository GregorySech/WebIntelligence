{"title": "Watch Microsoft demo and explain Windows Mixed Reality", "content": " \nMicrosoft held a special Windows Mixed Reality event in San Francisco yesterday, to launch its range of new VR headsets. While Microsoft refers to its entire platform as \u201cmixed reality,\u201d the new headsets that will be available on October 17th are simply virtual reality ones for now. The mixed reality platform is designed to include headsets like the HoloLens with its augmented reality implementation, and Microsoft hopes that one day we\u2019ll see headsets that combine virtual and augmented reality.\nWe\u2019ve previously covered exactly what Windows Mixed Reality looks like, but Microsoft\u2019s demonstrations also provide a good look at the games, apps, and experiences that the company will offer this holiday season. Alex Kipman, Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens inventor, walks through web browsing, holograms, gaming (including SteamVR), and even the AltspaceVR social space during a 30-minute presentation. It\u2019s a solid demonstration of exactly what Windows Mixed Reality will offer to compete against the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\nMicrosoft will launch Windows Mixed Reality with a range of headsets from Acer, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and Asus from October 17th. Not every headset will be available this month, but Samsung\u2019s arrives in November and Asus\u2019 early next year. Headsets will start at $399 with bundled motion controllers for the full support of Windows Mixed Reality.\n"}
