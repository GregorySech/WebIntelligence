{"title": "Logitech is acquiring gaming headset maker Astro for $85 million in cash", "content": " \nComputer accessory company Logitech announced today that it\u2019s acquiring Astro Gaming, a popular console gaming headset maker, for $85 million in cash. Astro will join the Logitech G division, Logitech\u2019s PC gaming-focused sub-brand, as part of a broader effort by the accessory maker to gain a better foothold in the console market. The deal is expected to close by the end of August. \nAstro gives Logitech an edge in the console accessory market\nHistorically, Logitech has catered to PC gamers with mice, keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals. With Astro, which caters to enthusiast and professional console gamers, Logitech will be able to cover more of the broader gaming accessory market. The company has no plans to shutter the Astro brand. For now, it sounds like Logitech G will stay focused on PC peripherals, while Astro will remain a console-first brand. (Astro products also work on PC, but are very clearly marketed toward console gamers via Astro\u2019s website and through resellers.)\n\u201cAstro is the leading player for premium console headsets and is the preferred headset for console e-sports athletes,\" Ujesh Desai, Logitech G\u2019s vice president, said in a statement. \"It's a perfect complement to Logitech G's focus on PC gaming and we couldn't be more excited; we love the team, the brand and the products. Together, we want to make game play even more fun for gamers everywhere.\u201d \n"}
