Worksafe, which analyzed reports filed with the US Labor Department\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, found similarly high injury rates in 2016 at the plant, but is unable to offer an accurate comparison because official industry-wide statistics are not yet available for that year.\nThe Worksafe report not only outlines an array of worrisome data of Tesla\u2019s past, it also questions whether the company\u2019s recent claims of improved safety are accurate or believable. \nThe report questions whether the company\u2019s claims of improved safety are accurate\nAmong the highlights at the Fremont factory that employs 10,000 workers:\n\nInjury rates were 31 percent higher than the US industry average in 2015, with a total recordable incidence rate of 8.8 per 100 workers compared with 6.7 per 100.\nTesla\u2019s total injury rate for 2016 was 8.1 injuries per 100 workers. (Industry stats for 2016 are not yet available, but if they remain at about 6.7 it would still put Tesla well beyond the average.)\nThe DART rate at Tesla in 2015 \u2014 a metric that means days away, restricted duty, or transfer rate \u2014 was double the industry rate in 2015. The DART rate identifies the number of days a worker is absent and is considered an indicator of the most serious nonfatal injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is trying to direct attention to its progress. \n\u201cWe may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future and with the changes we\u2019ve made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry.\u201d\n\u201cWe now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far.\u201d\nThe data analyzed and reported by Worksafe suggests Tesla has a long way to go before it will achieve that goal. The report also questions the company\u2019s recent claims of lowering injury rates at the factory. \nTesla published a blog in May highlighting improvements to its safety record and warning that the latest phase of UAW\u2019s campaign to organize workers \u201cinvolves a concerted and professional media push intended to raise questions about safety at Tesla.\u201d The blog boasted that the factory\u2019s injury rates were 4.6 injuries per 100 workers through the first quarter of 2017 \u2014 32 percent better than the industry average of 6.7. \nTesla is trying to direct attention to its progress\nWorksafe argues that one quarter isn\u2019t a sufficient length of time to accurately determine whether this is a trend or a temporary dip that might have been helped by a one-week closure of the factory for maintenance. Worksafe also contends that company\u2019s claims are based on preliminary data that can\u2019t be considered accurate \u201cgiven Tesla\u2019s erratic reporting patterns.\u201d \nTesla has vigorously defended its safety record in recent months, pushing back against claims that ambitious production goals have created an unsafe work environment. \nDespite Tesla\u2019s efforts, reports of worker safety issues have energized efforts to unionize the factory.\n"}
