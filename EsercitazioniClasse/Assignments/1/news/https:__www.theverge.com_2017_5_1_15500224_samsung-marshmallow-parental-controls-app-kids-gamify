{"title": "Samsung\u2019s latest app gamifies parental controls for kids", "content": " \nSamsung\u2019s latest app, Marshmallow (not to be confused with Android Marshmallow, an outdated OS still being put on phones in 2017), looks to gamify parental controls for kids, in an attempt to get them to use their phones less.\nThe app features traditional parental control features like limiting app and device usage, and it can\u2019t be deleted or disabled without the parent\u2019s password. But unlike other parental control apps, Marshmallow will reward kids with points that can be redeemed for gift cards if they keep their usage under the limits set by their parents, essentially employing delayed gratification to reduce their smartphone usage.\nKids can also set their own daily usage limits, and if they exceed their own settings they will lose points. Gift card options include major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, as well as the Google Play Store, but the parent has to approve and give access to the card before it can be used.\nMarshmallow, which can only be used on Samsung Galaxy devices, is available in the Google Play Store today.\n"}
