{"title": "This bathroom in South Korea shows which stalls are occupied", "content": " \nA post going around Reddit this week features a photo of a bathroom in Korea that has a display installed. This monitor provides a bunch of information, but most prominently, it tells people which stalls are occupied and whether the stalls have a regular or squatting toilet. (Squatting toilets are popular in Asia; feel free to go down an internet rabbit hole about them.)\nThis is all obviously useful information to have, and infinitely preferable to having to look at the occupied knob on a door, or, in a worst-case scenario, whether you see someone\u2019s feet. It also beats these bathroom lights that seemed like a brilliant idea in 2014. \nI\u2019m not sure how this display is being updated, like is it relying on the door locks to communicate back? Is someone manually updating it? I realize there likely isn\u2019t a bathroom attendant running back and forth between stalls to keep the display current, but I\u2019m going to dream. \nThe display also shows the temperature and humidity outside, as well as how stocks are doing that day. It\u2019s always nice to be reminded of the outside world while dealing with the horror that is a public bathroom. Good job, Korea, you\u2019ve figured out the ideal way to let people know whether a stall is taken.\n\n"}
