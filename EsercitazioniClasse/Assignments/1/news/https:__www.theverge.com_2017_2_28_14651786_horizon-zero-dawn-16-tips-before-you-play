{"title": "Horizon Zero Dawn: 16 tips before you play", "content": " \nI\u2019m smitten with Horizon: Zero Dawn, a video game that hits the best notes of the \u201cexplore, kill, and collect\u201d genre without becoming too leadened by busywork. It has a script on par with a fun sci-fi matinee, arguably the most polished visuals on a home console, and combat that amounts to more than shooting hundreds of dudes in the face. But I do wish I\u2019d known more about the game\u2019s idiosyncrasies before I played. \nDespite a lengthy tutorial prologue, many of Horizon\u2019s most useful tips and tools are buried in the game\u2019s opaque menus or mentioned offhand in text blurbs that appear on loading screens. I think my time with the game would have been better with a handful of pointers. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nHorizon Zero Dawn review: a greatest hits collection of open-world games\n\nThese are the lessons I learned in my playthrough, free of any major story spoilers. I\u2019ve ordered the tips as they\u2019re needed in the game\u2019s timeline, so don\u2019t feel pressured to remember every note at once. Think of this as a tour guide, something to take on your journey, directing you in interesting and useful directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nBeginner\u2019s advice:\nCommercials sell Horizon as if it\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed with guns, explosions, and robot dinosaurs, but the game is slower than that marketing suggests. A three-hour-long prologue introduces Aloy; her father figure Rost; the politics of her tribe, the Nora; and the fundamentals of how to collect materials, hunt beasts, and craft ammunition and upgrades. The intro is leisurely for good reason: it needs to establish a narrative foundation enough to withstand innumerable sequels. Which brings me to my one big note... \nRecalibrate your expectations \nThis isn\u2019t a traditional action game. It likes to think through its ideas, and spend time with its characters.\nAnd when the game does switch its emphasis from words to action, the combat doesn\u2019t regurgitate the traditional formula of swapping between increasingly powerful guns. Much of the game\u2019s weaponry is designed to suppress rather the damage. The ropecaster lasso beats and pins them to the ground. A slingshot fires ice and electricity projectiles that stun and freeze on impact. \nIf anything, the game punishes a guns-blazing attitude. The player is often outmatched and underpowered, and so the best path to victory involves scouting a battlefield, stealthily picking off weaker targets, and taking advantage of the weaknesses of the bigger beasts. It\u2019s a more strategic and thoughtful game than it leads on.\nPlay how you like\nThat said, you can choose to play as a brutal murder machine. If you find one method for downing a humongous rob-hawk to be tedious, try another. Maybe you should tie it to the ground. Maybe you should unlock the power to turn into an ally. Or maybe you should just pelt it with a half-dozen flaming wars. Even if your hunting methods seem to work well, there\u2019s often a reward in questioning your strategic assumptions. How I approached a scrimmage at the end of the game was totally different than how I started it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral tips:\n\nFree sample box at every trader\n\nA number of helpful and sometimes free items are buried in the menus at trader stations. For example, under the \u201ctreasure box\u201d window, every trader offers one free sample box. When you\u2019re low on supplies in the first few hours, these freebies are lifesavers.\nUse the map to locate quests\nThe game lets you select one quest and one waypoint at a time. On one hand, I\u2019m glad it doesn\u2019t let me litter the screen with icons egging me on in every direction. On the other hand, it\u2019s a pain to walk a few miles, only to realize you passed a few side quest objectives on the way. The trick is to check your map before a long trip. All quests are marked on the map with diamond icons. Rather than select one long route to a main quest, I\u2019d tie together a few sub-routes connecting secondary tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nRegularly stop at campfires to save your game\nHorizon\u2019s interface is vague about when it auto-saves. The one method for manually saving is visiting campfires. There are dozens of camps on the map, usually a short run from anywhere you need to go. To be safe, stop by a fire and tap the triangle button to force a quick save.\nFast travel to camp fires\nTraveling on foot is useful for gathering resources and locating hidden item caches, but sometimes you\u2019ll want to cut to the chase. Once you\u2019ve discover a camp fire (it will appear as green on the map) you can fast travel to the location. To fast travel, simply open the map menu, select a discovered campfire, and hold R2. Each fast travel requires a fast travel token. I\u2019ll get to the more sustainable solution in a moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nHunting:\nScan animals \nEach beast is made of different components, many of which have their own weakness and some of which can be removed entirely. Approach a collection of enemies in a crouch stance, hide in the weeds, and use the focus to mark enemies, gauge weakness, and plan the attack. For example...\n\n\u201cFreeze\u201d stalls enemies and increases damage\n\nIf beast is vulnerable to freeze, a few icy arrows or snow grenades, followed by a volley of explosives or fire arrows can bring down midrange creatures.\n\n\u201cTear\u201d helps to steal weapons from machines\n\nMost high-range creatures have heavy weaponry bolted to their sides and spine. A weapon with strong tear (represented by a shield icon) can knock weapons loose. Aloy can then grab the weaponry and use it against enemies. This method is stupidly useful \u2014 mounted weapons are the most powerful options in the game \u2014 and I can\u2019t believe it took me 20 hours to catch on to the technique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nUpgrades:\nCompleting missions and hunting beasts earn XP, XP increases Aloy\u2019s level, and each level rewards points that can be spent on new skills. Like I said earlier, play the game however you prefer. I personally found this path to be useful.\nLearn to fire multiple arrows ASAP\nIf you want to play stealth, you will need to neutralize human targets from a long range with a single attack. Most bow and arrow sets can\u2019t kill with a single headshot. By firing two or three arrows at once, you eliminate all but the most powerful endgame foot soldiers. The upgrade applies to all arrow types, making arrows with fire, electricity, freeze, and tear (armor-busting) buffs far more useful.\nBecome a beast master\nOnce you reach the game\u2019s central hub \u2014 a city name Meridian that is a flagrant collision of Game of Thrones\u2019 King\u2019s Landing and Braavos \u2014 your quest will span miles on terrain and be interrupted by packs of beasts. It takes too much time and is too dangerous to travel on foot. By this point, Aloy should be able to turn some creatures into rideable allies, but I often found myself in the middle of nowhere without a mount in sight. One unlockable ability allows you to call a good-natured mount with a tap of a button. The creature will also play a support role in combat. It\u2019s not a great way to deal damage, but does serve as a useful distraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nTake the hunter tests\nFive hunter camps with three unique tests are scattered across the map. The game\u2019s tutorials are optional and not particularly useful. Hunter tests provide examples of when and how you should use a weapon. Plus, each test awards bronze, silver, and gold medals. Collect 15 of any medal, and you unlock a weapon that outclasses everything sold by merchants. \nVisit the cauldrons\nI don\u2019t want to spoil the cauldrons, so trust me when I say, visit them as soon as possible. They are, design-wise, like the tombs in Assassin\u2019s Creed: large-scale, standalone platforming trials. But there\u2019s so much more to them. They unlock some of the best abilities in the game, and they provide some of the best visual storytelling when it comes to the pre-apocalypse backstory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nThe open world:\nOnce you reach Meridian, it\u2019s time to find your own fun. The game divides its missions into main quests, side quests, and errands. I found the errands to be an optional grind for folks who would rather eat the rind than see food go to waste. That said, side quests offer substantial XP rewards, provide backstory that gives some weight to the final act, and sometimes unlock the best weapons and armor. \nPurchase the unlimited fast travel tool \nBy the time you reach Meridian, merchants should be selling an unlimited fast travel tool. It\u2019s hidden at the bottom of the items menu as a purple item, referencing its supposed rareness. You will fast travel regularly in the second half of the game, particularly when you want to exit Meridian which doesn\u2019t allow mounts to enter, and is located high above most of the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Horizon Zero Dawn\n\n\nGo on the big hunt\nIn Meridian, you will find the hunter\u2019s lodge. A couple of the members will offer a series of hunting-related side quests. Do them. One, they flesh out the mythology of the land and the beasts. Two, they feature some of the best robots battles. Three, the rewards will be useful for Horizon\u2019s final showdowns. I did these missions in tandem with the hinting test, which unintentionally created a Rocky-like montage in the middle of the game. It felt like I was learning the necessary skills to complete the story using the various combat techniques rather than brute-forcing my way to the finish line with health packs and hundreds of grenades.\nFire beats bird\nGroups of birds can turn a small battle into a nightmarish headache. So remember this: fire takes down birds. Boost your fire arrows and you won't even need to worry about grounding the boogers. Fire will make them crash\nThis basic logic applies to all creatures. Experiment with your weapons, and don\u2019t assume one method is best. Scan battle for weaknesses, switch modifications, kill robots. \n"}
