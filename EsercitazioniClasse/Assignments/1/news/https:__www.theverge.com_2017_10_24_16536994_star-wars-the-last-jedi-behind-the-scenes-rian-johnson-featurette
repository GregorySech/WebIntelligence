{"content": " Episode VIII of the Star Wars film series, The Last Jedi, will open in theaters December 15th, but a featurette released today offers fans a look at what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. It\u2019s focused on writer and director Rian Johnson, first as a fan, then as a director. And it features short thoughts from Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Mark Hamill, and the late Carrie Fisher about working with him.\u201cFirst time shooting with Mark. First time shooting with Daisy. First time shooting a Star Wars movie, and you know, it\u2019s some cool stuff,\u201d Johnson says. Later, he instructs Chewbacca to growl \u201csad like a dog whimper,\u201d and bounces around the film\u2019s impressive set. The featurette is partially built around a long quote where he explains how the job initially overwhelmed him, until he got \u201cinto the nitty-gritty of it all,\u201d and could just focus on the job of making individual scenes work.In an interview with USA Today, Johnson spoke further about his vision for the film\u2019s characters, and about working with Fisher. \u201cHaving these scenes in the film recontextualize tragically with her not being here anymore. It\u2019s incredibly emotional,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cFor the next few months, seeing the fans\u2026 process the loss and celebrate her as Leia one last time, it\u2019s going to be intense. I think it\u2019s going to be really sad but really joyful, I hope.\u201d", "title": "Go behind the scenes of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in this Rian Johnson-focused featurette"}
