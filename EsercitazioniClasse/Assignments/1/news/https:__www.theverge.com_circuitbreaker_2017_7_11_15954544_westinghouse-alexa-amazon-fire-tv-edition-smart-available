{"title": "Westinghouse\u2019s Alexa-equipped Fire TV Edition smart TVs are now available", "content": " \nElement led the charge when it came to selling the first round of \u201cFire TV Edition\u201d smart TVs, and now Westinghouse has announced availability for its version of the Amazon-partnered TVs.  \nWestinghouse\u2019s Fire TV Edition models will come in 43-, 50-, 55-, and 65-inch sizes, starting at $449.99. The key selling point, of course, is the built-in Amazon Fire TV, which is controlled with the bundled Voice Remote and features Amazon\u2019s Alexa assistant.\nThe sets aren\u2019t bad for the price, either. You\u2019re not getting a top-of-the-line model by any metric, but all four screen sizes offer full 4K resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, four HDMI ports, and 16GB of internal storage (expandable via USB or SD card).\nThe new Westinghouse models should be available at retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. \n"}
