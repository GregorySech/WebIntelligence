Sprint users can get a free six-month trial of Tidal HiFi and listen to the album for free. \u201cJay Z is a global icon and we\u2019re giving customers an incredible opportunity to be among the first to experience his new album 4:44,\u201d Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in a statement. \n\n\nHere's the 4:44 ad pic.twitter.com/Jv0DBX6FoR\u2014 . (@BergsRB5) June 8, 2017\n\n\n\nTidal has been teasing 4:44 with billboards and videos on YouTube featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and Danny Glover for the past few weeks, hinting that the album may have an extensive visual component. \nThis will be Jay Z\u2019s first album since Magna Carta Holy Grail was released back in 2013. Jay Z has reportedly been working with producers including Swizz Beatz and Zaytoven over the past year, but there is no indication of what we\u2019ll hear on the album. We\u2019ll just have to wait until June 30th.\n\n"}
