{"title": "Sprint is killing its best 50 percent off deal", "content": " \nSprint is canceling its long-running promotion where it offered 50 percent off competitors\u2019 plans to customers who switched over to Sprint, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. \nIt\u2019s not an entirely surprising move. According to analyst Jeffrey Moore, the entire driving point of the 50 percent offer was to upsell customers to equally priced plans than competitors with more data. But in today\u2019s cellphone industry where everyone offers unlimited plans, Sprint has nothing more to offer than the rival carriers it hopes to convince customers to switch over from.\nSprint\u2019s unlimited plan starts at $50 per line \u2014 cheaper than AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile \u2014 but offering half off even the most expensive of those plans (AT&T, at $90 a month for a single line) still undercuts Sprint\u2019s own plan, which can\u2019t be a viable long-term strategy. Even the company\u2019s latest limited time promotion \u2014 $80 a month for two unlimited lines, which is by no means a bad price \u2014 isn\u2019t as cheap as what you would have been able to get if the 50 percent discount was still available. \nIt\u2019s another indication that, in a world where data is equal, companies will need to work harder to find ways for their plans to remain competitive. It\u2019s something we\u2019re already seeing from other carriers: T-Mobile offers weekly promotions for its subscribers, and AT&T just added free HBO for its highest paying unlimited customers. Ultimately, if there\u2019s any lesson to be learned here, its that free competition ultimately leads to better service for customers, which is never a bad thing. \n"}
