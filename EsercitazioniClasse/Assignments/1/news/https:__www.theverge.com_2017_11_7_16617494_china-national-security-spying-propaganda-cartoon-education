{"content": " It\u2019s National Security month in China, and the government made a cartoon to remind young children that they, too, can encourage their parents to protect national secrets and be counterspies, as first reported by Quartz.In a 10-minute video released by the state-run Chinese Society of Education, various kids, all wearing the requisite red scarves of the Chinese Young Pioneers, were asked what they think national security means. One girl says her mom often forgets to turn off the stove, but her dad reminded her enough times, removing that security problem. A boy says his dad is a rich man and can hire bodyguards to ensure his own security.The next boy, however, tells the class a story about his dad, a Chinese military engineer who was paid by a foreign magazine to send possibly sensitive photos of his factory workplace. With the money, his dad says, he can take the kid to go see pandas at the zoo. It\u2019s a cute idea, but just then, grandpa barges in, holding up a newspaper article about a man arrested and jailed for sending 500 photos of China\u2019s first aircraft carrier to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a foreign magazine. The boy\u2019s dad laughs off the idea of spies, but under grandpa\u2019s pressuring, he rejects the foreign magazine\u2019s requests and even tries to return the money. The magazine threatens legal action, and the loss of the dad\u2019s job, if he doesn\u2019t cooperate. \u201cOur national treasures aren\u2019t just pandas.\u201dLike in any good propaganda, though, the true hero of the story is the state. The dad reports the incident to his local national security bureau, and an official promises to protect his career and his family. He\u2019s encouraged to practice counterespionage, and that\u2019s the lesson his kid brings to class for show-and-tell to a round of gasps and awe from his classmates. \u201cOur national treasures aren\u2019t just pandas,\u201d the kid says, eyes burning with passion. \u201cBut technology, finance, and others are all national treasures.\u201dChina first passed its counterespionage law in 2014, which lets officials seize any property related to harmful activities and tell individuals to stop behaving in any way that endangers China\u2019s interests. Although National Security Education Day in China usually falls on April 15th, it could be that children\u2019s education on national security was an issue brought up during the Communist Party congress held at the end of October, as it\u2019s an issue embedded in Xi Jinping\u2019s presidency.
