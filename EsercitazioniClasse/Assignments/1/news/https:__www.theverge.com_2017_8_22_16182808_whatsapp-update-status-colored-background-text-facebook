It\u2019s pretty much identical to a feature on Facebook, and also allows users to add a link and choose a font for their statuses. Previously, you could only use photos and videos as a background.\nFacebook began adding the colored-background statuses in December 2016.

The statuses disappear after 24 hours and can be added to WhatsApp\u2019s stories feature \u2014 copied from Snapchat, and now available on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. \nEphemeral messages, photos, and videos are all the rage and consistently pull in users, so flagship social media apps are touting the feature for obvious reasons. But updates like this make it seem like in the future, we\u2019ll just have a bunch of different apps that all do the same thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
