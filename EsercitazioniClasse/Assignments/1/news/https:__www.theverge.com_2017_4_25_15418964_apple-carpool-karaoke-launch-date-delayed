{"title": "Apple delays its Carpool Karaoke series until 'later this year'", "content": " \nApple\u2019s first TV show, the spinoff Carpool Karaoke: The Series, has been delayed. The show, based on the popular segment from the Late Late Show with James Corden, was originally scheduled to launch on Apple Music in April. But the iPhone-maker told Reuters its debut has been postponed to an unknown date \u201clater this year.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what happened to cause the delay, but Reuters says a launch party for the show was \u201cpostponed without explanation days before it was to take place.\u201d \nCarpool Karaoke: The Series was set to be the first originally-produced show released by Apple on its music streaming service. It\u2019s set to be joined this year (again, at an unknown date) by the launch of the company\u2019s Shark Tank-style reality TV show, Planet of the Apps. The delays and the content of the shows themselves aren\u2019t that inspiring for a company that reportedly wants to have hit TV dramas that rival those made by HBO and Netflix. Apple is known for taking its time with new products, but it\u2019s a little odd when the product in question isn\u2019t even new. \n\n"}
