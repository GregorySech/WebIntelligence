{"title": "Google Home may get support for multiple user accounts", "content": " \nGoogle may be on its way to solving one of the biggest problems with smart speakers: they only work with a single account.\nAndroid Police spotted signs in the latest version of the Google Home app that suggest the company is working on multi-user support. The code also contains references to a device being able to \u201crecognize your voice\u201d and needing to be trained, which suggests that user switching could happen by Google\u2019s device identifying who\u2019s speaking.\nEvery company with a smart speaker should be working on this\nGoogle declined to comment on whether it\u2019s adding multi-user support when asked by The Verge, but it offered this brief statement: \u201cWe continue developing new experiences for Google Home, but we don\u2019t have specific updates to share at this time,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Google \u2014 and any other company with a smart speaker \u2014 isn\u2019t working on this, as it\u2019s one of these devices\u2019 biggest limitations. Having an always-on digital assistant is great, but not if your commands are going to add things to your partner, roommate, or family member\u2019s account. Right now, all the big ones only support a single user.\nCoincidentally enough, it just came out earlier this week that Amazon is working on getting Alexa to distinguish between voices, too. Time said the feature is pretty much complete, but that Amazon is working through some final implementation issues, including privacy concerns. (Alexa devices technically support multiple users already, but you have to manually switch between them.)\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Google\u2019s multi-user support could be extremely early in development, and it\u2019s entirely possible nothing will ever come of it \u2014 we\u2019re just staring at about a dozen lines of code, after all. But it certainly seems like something is in the works, which is good news for anyone with a Google Home and several people in their house.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nGoogle Home\u2019s biggest challenge will be handling accounts for the whole family\n\nUpdate March 2nd, 7:10PM ET: This story has been updated with a comment from Google.\n"}
