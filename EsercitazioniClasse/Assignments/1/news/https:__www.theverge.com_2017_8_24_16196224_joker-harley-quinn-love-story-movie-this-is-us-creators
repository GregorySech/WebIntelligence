{"title": "The Joker and Harley Quinn spin-off will be like \u2018When Harry Met Sally on benzedrine\u2019", "content": " \nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa, best known for the 2011 romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love \u2014 starring eventual La La Land leads Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling \u2014 will be directing a Suicide Squad spin-off about the love story between the Joker and Harley Quinn. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film is being described internally as \u201ca criminal love story,\u201d \u201can insane and twisted love story,\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally on benzedrine.\u201d The third statement is particularly interesting, given that When Harry Met Sally is a movie about a pair of platonic friends facing the ups and downs of life in New York in the 1980s together and eventually forging a romantic connection based on 10 years of emotional intimacy. Is that canon for the Joker and Harley Quinn love story? Wouldn\u2019t it be kind of fun if it was? Is it possible that whoever said that has not actually seen When Harry Met Sally?\nIn any case, the movie is untitled and will be released after the upcoming Suicide Squad sequel, which does not yet have a director attached. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie will reprise their roles and the film will be part of DC\u2019s cinematic universe, but so will another Joker spin-off, directed by The Hangover\u2019s Todd Phillips and starring a so-far-unknown actor. \nThe DC universe functions differently than Marvel\u2019s in this respect, as there\u2019s a core Justice League / Suicide Squad storyline, splintering side stories, and totally unrelated additional films using some of the same characters. Matt Reeves' The Batman (which won\u2019t star Ben Affleck) could be another one of those projects. \nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa are also executive producers of NBC\u2019s This is Us and worked with Margot Robbie on Focus and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. I can\u2019t wait to see their benzedrine-infused Nora Ephron fan fiction. \n\n\n"}
