{"title": "Asking Alexa \u2018who poop?\u2019 is a wild ride", "content": " \nDigital assistants like Alexa are supposed to answer all your burning questions, giving accurate responses to important queries like \u201cIs it raining?\u201d and \u201cWhere is France?\u201d But sometimes, the methods these programs use to dredge information from the web haul up some oddities. Case in point: you should really try asking Alexa \u201cwho poop?\u201d because the answer you will get is baffling. \nAs discovered by Twitter user @tagsavage, if you ask Alexa this question, you\u2019ll get in reply a long list of famous individuals \u2014 living and dead \u2014 who all, presumably, poop. \n\n\nMost, but not all, people who poop are British pic.twitter.com/SztRvInHj4\u2014 tagsavage (@tagsavage) March 10, 2017\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the poopers:\nElizabeth II, Victoria of the United Kingdom, Prince Philip, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Abraham Lincoln, Prince Charles, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Madonna, Edward VII of the United Kingdom, Prince Albert, Elizabeth I of England, Theodore Roosevelt, Diana the Princess of Wales, Princess Anne, Wayne Rooney, Prince William of Wales, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, William IV of the United Kingdom, Sean Connery, Ralph Fiennes, Margaret Thatcher, Stephen Grover Cleveland\nThe list goes on, but the majority of people mentioned fall into two camps: a) British royalty or b) American presidents. There\u2019s also a smattering of celebrities, philosophers, and generally famous people thrown in for good measure, including Steve Ballmer, Florence Nightingale, and Nietzsche. When you check Alexa\u2019s app you can see, yes, it really is answering the question \u201cwho poop?\u201d (Ask \u201cwho poops?\u201d though, and you get nothing, zip, nada.) It even throws in an illustration for good measure: a 16th-century woodcut named \u201cThe Perfumer\u201d which shows someone having an olde-timey poop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfumer, who definitely poops.\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nThe abiding question here is what in the everloving fuck is going on? A number of different Verge staff in different countries tried asking Alexa the same question, and we all got the same answer, with the app confirming the program is definitely hearing the query correctly.\nUsually when digital assistants throw up weird responses like this, it\u2019s due to Google\u2019s \u201cone true answer\u201d function \u2014 the search engine\u2019s habit of highlighting a single result instead of pointing users to other websites. This practice is mostly useful, but can easily be hijacked, leading Google to spread false information like \u201cMSG causes brain damage\u201d or \u201cBarack Obama is King of the United States.\u201d \nAlexa gets at least some of its answers via Bing, which should mean it sidesteps this issue. But if you search Bing \u201cwho poop?\u201d the list of people above is nowhere to be seen. Even if you search for the names mentioned in the order they appear you get nothing. Ask Google Assistant and it just searches the web; ask Siri and it tells you: \u201cThat\u2019s not nice.\u201d So what is going on? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoPooped.org is an advert for the Minnesota Zoo.\n\n\nWe\u2019re honestly not sure. We\u2019ve reached out to Amazon on this one (they just love hard-hitting questions like this), but if you have any suggestions of what\u2019s happening, let us know. We can, at least, answer the mystery of why someone was asking Alexa \u201cwho poop?\u201d in the first place. OG poop-questioner @tagsavage told The Verge that they had \u201cstarted with the more natural question of \u2018who farted?\u2019 and then upped the ante.\u201d \nThat, at least, makes perfect sense. \n"}
