{"title": "What if the iPhone 8 Plus is better than the iPhone X?", "content": " \nIt feels like no-one cares about the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Last week it was reported that Apple\u2019s latest iPhones are actually being outsold by their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. I can\u2019t vouch for the veracity of that analysis, but it wouldn\u2019t really surprise me if it were true. People that buy iPhones in September are early adopters. Early adopters are likely to wait for the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 isn\u2019t a transformative upgrade over the 7, and the 7 now costs $100 less than it did before. Simple enough.\nBut I\u2019m someone who buys a new iPhone every year, for my sins, and while you\u2019d think that would put me in the category of people who\u2019d be holding out for the X, I actually bought an iPhone 8 Plus last month instead. This isn\u2019t because of price \u2014 I\u2019d spend the extra on the X if I were sure I\u2019d like it better. The thing is, much as I do enjoy new, intriguing, shiny objects, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll like the 8 Plus better as a phone in the end.\nHere\u2019s why.\nDisplay\nThis is the big one, quite literally. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people assume the X will be an unambiguous slam dunk in this regard, saying the device has a bigger screen than the iPhone 8 Plus in a body close to the size of the regular iPhone 8. But this isn\u2019t really true, and I think a lot of people used to the Plus-sized iPhones will be disappointed with the X in practice.\nYes, the iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen compared to the iPhone 8 Plus\u2019 5.5-inch display. It\u2019s also true that the X\u2019s is higher resolution. But the 8 Plus\u2019 screen is actually bigger. The X uses a narrower aspect ratio, so while it\u2019s longer on the diagonal, you still get more surface area on the Plus overall \u2014 and that\u2019s before you account for the notch and the rounded corners. I know, comparing screen sizes isn't what it used to be. \nThe X won't show plus-sized app layouts\nBut the bottom line is that the Plus will display more useful content at once, even with its lower resolution. It\u2019s wider as you hold it in portrait, which is why Apple introduced a new size class for app layouts when the iPhone 6 Plus first came out. Apps, websites, and so on have 414 horizontal \u201cpoints\u201d \u2014 the unit of measurement that the screen is divided into for design purposes \u2014 to fill on the Plus, while the X has 375, the same as the regular iPhone 8. The X has more vertical points, of course, because of the taller screen, but a lot of that will be occupied by the notch and home button bar. \nWhat this means is that apps on the X will use the same basic layouts as the iPhone 8, not the Plus. You'll get more vertical content in portrait mode, but in landscape mode you'll actually see less vertical screen space than even the smaller 8 because of how developers need to avoid the virtual home button bar as well as the notch. You won't get the Plus' iPad-style multi-panel views, either. And how long will it take before all your apps get updated for the X in the first place? I'm still using several that never got updated for the iPhone 6. \n\n\niPhone X is definitely no iPhone Plus. This is gonna be a hard transition for anybody who actually cares about Plus features pic.twitter.com/gwlPjQ9FN2\u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 12, 2017\n\n\n\nThe X\u2019s screen may well be better quality \u2014 we\u2019ll have to see how Apple\u2019s first attempt at an OLED phone turns out, but I have high hopes for the panel itself. Obviously, there\u2019s also no denying that the X makes far better use of available space; the iPhone 8 Plus\u2019 chunky bezels are pretty anachronistic for a phone at this price in 2017. But I\u2019m too used to the Plus layouts, and the accompanying information density, to go back to what\u2019s often going to feel like a smaller phone in actual use.\nVideo is also a concern with the X. When watching regular 16:9 content, the notch and aspect ratio mean that you\u2019re either going to have a lot of wasted space, or things are going to look weird. (Granted, the X will possibly be better for viewing wider cinematic content, in case you do feel like watching Lawrence of Arabia on the bus.)\nThis morning I caught up on the weekend\u2019s Premier League action on my 8 Plus, for example. I wouldn\u2019t really want to do that on anything smaller, but coupled with the much-improved speakers it\u2019s a great experience on the Plus. As with TVs, it turns out that a big 1080p 16:9 rectangle is the best and most reliable way to show the majority of video content out there.\nTouch ID\nI expect Face ID to work very well on the X. I doubt Apple would launch it otherwise, considering the inevitable backlash that would follow \u2014 the company doesn\u2019t want a repeat of the Apple Maps fiasco, where it removed a critical feature of the iPhone and replaced it with something much worse.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I particularly want to use Face ID. There could be some technical issues to iron out at launch, and even if there aren\u2019t, it\u2019s just another thing to figure out and get used to without any immediate advantages. (I\u2019m not sure Animoji counts.)  Apple itself fell foul of this when it announced Face ID, as Craig Federighi couldn\u2019t log into his demo unit on stage after the authentication had been reset. The system was working as intended, but that's kind of the point \u2014 if it's able to trip up even Apple's tightly managed press events, it\u2019s going to take a minute for regular users to learn what to expect.\nMeanwhile, Touch ID works on the iPhone 8 Plus the same way it always has. It\u2019s fast, reliable, and you know what you\u2019re doing when you activate it. I\u2019m happy to continue using it while iPhone X owners work through any Face ID kinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nOkay, so Apple saying the iPhone 8 has a \u201cnew design\u201d stretches the boundaries of belief as much as it did when Apple said the same thing about the iPhone 7. This is still very much a tweaked iPhone 6. But what matters is what you think of the tweaks.\nI really like the tweaks. The glass back feels great, and while Apple is very late to wireless charging, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here now. I\u2019m also very into the new \u201cgold\u201d colorway, which is more like copper on the sides and cream on the back \u2014 it feels like something a \u201970s Bond villain would use. The grey and white versions, too, look appealingly minimalist in a way that the 6 never did. \nTo be clear, the iPhone X is the more attractive and beguiling device. I even thought as much of the knockoff models I found at a tech market in Shenzhen last month. But the 8 makes a statement of its own, giant bezels and all. That statement is \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with what most phones are like today, and I want the ultimate one of those.\u201d \nPrice\nThis isn\u2019t a huge concern to me because I split phone costs over 24 months, so the X would be less than $10 a month extra. But that adds up, of course \u2014 $200 is $200, even if you aren\u2019t paying upfront. And if you are, you'd have to really want the X.\nAvailability\nEven if you\u2019ve read all of the above and still want an iPhone X, good luck actually getting one. Supply chain reports suggest that Apple is only able to produce the device in alarmingly low quantities, meaning that you could be waiting for several months before you\u2019re able to pick one up. If you use a phone for several years, that\u2019s less of an issue. But if you buy a phone every year or two? Waiting is going to take a serious chunk out of the amount of time you\u2019ll spend with this one.\nYou can walk into an Apple store right now and buy a phone with the same software, processor, primary camera, and wireless charging support, along with a more useful screen, more familiar method of biometric authentication, and way hotter color scheme, for hundreds of dollars less than the X.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand the desire to have the cool new thing \u2014 believe me, I\u2019m usually the first to fall victim to it. But when I laid it out like this in my head, I surprised myself by finding it really hard to justify the X. Your needs and desires may differ, and that\u2019s totally fine. If you're sure your next smartphone has to be an iPhone, I would just advise you to consider the 8 Plus as the X preorder frenzy begins this week \u2014 it\u2019s not exciting, but it might be better for you.\nWhen you buy an iPhone X, you\u2019re buying into Apple\u2019s vision for the future of the smartphone. When you buy an iPhone 8, you\u2019re buying the best version of the present. The former is more exciting, but if you need a new phone today, the latter may prove to be more pragmatic. Like Nilay said: it's an iPhone.\nNext year's iPhone X-2 Plus, though? Count me in. \n\n\n    Related\n  \niPhone X review: face the future\n\n\n"}
