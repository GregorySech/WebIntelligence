{"title": "Watch a teaser trailer for Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho\u2019s new Netflix film", "content": " \nSnowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho is bringing his next film straight to Netflix. Okja, a mysterious monster movie starring Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lily Collins, and 13-year-old South Korean star Ahn Seo-hyun, will debut on the service sometime in June. \nErik-Jan de Boe, the Academy Award-winning effects supervisor for Life of Pi, was responsible for the visual effects and the script was co-written by Bong and journalist / documentarist Jon Ronson (The Men Who Stare at Goats, So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed).\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\u2018Snowpiercer\u2019 review: take a train ride to the apocalypse\n\nThe film centers on Ahn Seo-hyun\u2019s character, a young girl who lives in the woods with her best friend Okja, a genetic science experiment that you catch only a glimpse of in the trailer. It has elephant skin and nice eyes. You also catch a glimpse of Tilda Swinton\u2019s character, who looks to be a mad scientist in the vein of Silicon Valley. She has a platinum blonde bob and lots of Jurassic Park-sounding philosophies. You do not, for some reason, catch a glimpse of Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s character, but here is a photo of him from when the film shot in New York City last summer: \n\n\nOkja will premiere globally on Netflix in June and will have a limited day-and-date theatrical release in the U.S. #JakeGyllenhaal #Okja pic.twitter.com/fT5JUQzSVs\u2014 JakeGyllenhaal FF (@GyllenhaalicsFF) February 28, 2017\n\n\n\nOkja will have a limited theatrical release in the US following its online debut, mimicking the release strategy that Netflix used for its first original film, Beasts of No Nation. This project is much bigger, with a $50 million budget compared to Beasts\u2019 $6 million. Netflix probably doesn\u2019t have to worry too much about traditional box office hauls, as Beasts of No Nation made only $91,000 in ticket sales but still won a SAG Award for Idris Elba, was streamed over three million times, and apparently encouraged the platform to keep dabbling in prestigious film projects.\nIt\u2019s rumored that Okja may debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May. \n"}
