{"title": "You won\u2019t be able to use your Surface Book if you want to take the bar in Tennessee", "content": " \nIf you\u2019re planning on using your Surface Book or a laptop with the Windows 10 Creators Update on it to take the bar exam in Tennessee next month, you\u2019re out of luck. The state bar has prohibited test-takers from using the device, and anyone using a device with the new updates will have to make some adjustments. \nAccording to the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners, the directive comes from limitations with the exam software, SofTest, which doesn\u2019t support the Windows 10 Creators Update, or any Surface Book other than a Surface Pro. Users will be required to change some compatibility settings in order to take the test. The board is also recommending that users disable automatic updates for their computer, because the updates can cause the device to freeze if the user is actively using the exam software. Test-takers who are planning to use a computer with the Windows 10 Creators Update installed are asked to notify the board by July 12th, which apparently will require them to sign an additional addendum to their Laptop Agreement. Violators will be asked to leave and \u201cwill have to answer to the Board regarding their failure to follow instructions.\u201d \nFailure to comply means ejection from the exam and a summons to the board for an explanation \nUsers who don\u2019t make the change won\u2019t be allowed to use their laptop, and Surface devices or other tablets with a detachable keyboard won\u2019t be permitted at all. Violate the rule? Ejection from the exam and a summons to the board regarding their failure to follow instructions. The same goes for anyone found with a device-compatible Pen in their possession.\nMacBook users should be okay, but the board also noted that the software will disable a MacBook Pro\u2019s TouchBar, which other organizations have banned around the country, because they\u2019re \u201cnot compatible with the security features of the ExamSoft software.\u201d \nThe prohibition was first spotted by @thirdscrivener, who questioned why the detachable keyboard is specifically an issue, noting that he\u2019s \u201ctaken multiple law school exams\u201d on his own Surface Book, each without issue. While the exam software does work for Surface Pro (which must use an external keyboard) users and iPads, the Tennessee law board simply isn\u2019t permitting them. \n"}
