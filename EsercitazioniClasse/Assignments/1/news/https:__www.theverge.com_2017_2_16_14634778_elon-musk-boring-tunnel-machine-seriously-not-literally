{"title": "Elon Musk dishes more dirt on his tunneling plans", "content": " \nBloomberg has a great new feature out on Elon Musk\u2019s tunnel boring ambitions. It adds a lot of color to what we know so far about the billionaire\u2019s plans, but still leaves us with questions. Since Musk first started tweeting about his tunnel plans last December, we\u2019ve been on the fence about whether or not the SpaceX CEO is joking. And while we now know he\u2019s definitely not, what happens next is anyone\u2019s guess. \nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve got so far:\n\n\nMusk is building a test tunnel. It\u2019s in the parking lot of SpaceX headquarters in LA. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere (apart from down), and Musk will need city permits to continue. There\u2019s no word on where the tunnel might go, only that it will accommodate cars. (We\u2019ve seen pictures of this hole already.)\n\nHe has a boring machine. Its a 2015 model nicknamed \u201cNannie\u201d that\u2019s 400 feet long and weighs 1,200 tons.  \n\nThe project has a leader but \u201cno full-time employees.\u201d SpaceX engineer Steve Davis is in charge, but that seems to be about it. The company will, though, be independent of SpaceX and Musk\u2019s other ventures. \n\nMusk compares the tunneling industry to aerospace. I.e., he wants to improve upon decades of stagnant technology (making boring machines with \u201cdramatically increase[d]\u201d speeds), and offer services that are cheaper than those currently available \u2014 just as he has with rocket launches and SpaceX. \n\nEventually, he wants to build a vast network of tunnels. He suggested some could include as many as 30 levels for cars and high-speed trains.\n\nBloomberg joins together some other dots that might (or might not) shed some light on Musk\u2019s plans. As we\u2019ve noted before, it\u2019s possible that Musk\u2019s love of tunnels is connected to President Donald Trump\u2019s big infrastructure push. And while Musk and Trump don\u2019t, on paper, seem like natural allies, the SpaceX CEO has been slowly aligning himself with the new administration \u2014 attending meetings at Trump Tower and tweeting his support for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \nMusk also has a track record of getting into bed with government for his big enterprises. SpaceX, of course, has won contracts with NASA for its rocket launches; while Tesla has benefitted from tax credits for electric cars and subsidies for its Nevada-based Gigafactory. And government contracts for big infrastructure projects are often negotiated with terms that are generous to industry. \nSo: a tunneling company with improved equipment that competes for government contracts? Maybe Musk\u2019s plans are boring after all. \n"}
