{"title": "Samsung\u2019s Gear Fit 2 Pro can track your swims, thanks to better water resistance", "content": " \nA new version of Samsung\u2019s fitness-tracking wearable, the Gear Fit 2 Pro, has leaked online ahead of the company\u2019s Unpacked event with a listing on Samsung\u2019s Malaysia website, which was spotted by Evan Blass. \nThe Gear Fit 2 Pro is an upgraded version of Samsung\u2019s Gear Fit 2 fitness tracker from last year. The biggest addition is its water resistance up to 5ATM (roughly 50 meters or around 164 feet), meaning you\u2019ll be able to wear the Gear Fit 2 Pro while swimming. To that end, along with the improved water resistance, Samsung is also adding a new Speedo app to help track your swimming. There\u2019s also a new and improved buckle strap, which should keep the Gear Fit 2 Pro secure on your wrist while you\u2019re swimming laps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the swim features, the rest of the Gear Fit 2 Pro is more or less the same as last year\u2019s model. You\u2019ll be able to install the same apps and watchfaces from the Galaxy App Store, the screen is still a curved AMOLED display, there\u2019s integrated GPS for tracking runs, and Samsung is promising between three and four days of battery life. And of course, in addition to the swim tracking, the Gear Fit 2 Pro will still do the same gamut of heart rate tracking, step counting, and run tracking as last year\u2019s model.\nThe Gear Fit 2 Pro will come in two colors: an entirely black model, and a red variant. While the price and release date haven\u2019t been confirmed yet, a separate leak from Blass claims that it\u2019ll cost $199, or $20 more than the standard Gear Fit 2.   \n"}
