{"title": "The studio behind Journey is making an Apple TV game", "content": " \nThatgamecompany is a studio best known for poetic, emotional adventures like Flower and Journey \u2014 and now the team is bringing its next release to Apple TV. Creative lead and studio CEO Jenova Chen was onstage today at Apple\u2019s latest keynote to show off Sky, billed as a \u201cromantic adventure game.\u201d It looks in keeping with the studio\u2019s past work, with lush environments to explore and comparatively minimalist game elements. It\u2019s also is being designed in part with the Apple TV in mind. \u201cEverything can be done with one finger on the Siri remote,\u201d Chen says of the game.\nIn a blog post on the studio\u2019s site, thatgamecompany provided a bit more detail on just what Sky will be like.\n\nSky has been a few years in the making.  After the release of Journey, so many fans wrote to tell us how much they enjoyed playing the game with their spouse, children, or loved ones, and asked if we could create a game where they could play together. We wanted as many people to love games, and so we were encouraged to explore this idea at thatgamecompany.  Which brings our games, for the first time, to mobile \u2014 a platform that many have access to, the world over.  \nIt\u2019s hard to explain the game, but a good place would be to say that Sky is a game specially created to be played, and shared, among loved ones and family.  If you can imagine the delight of visiting a theme park where lasting memories are made, we envision Sky will sometimes feel like that.\n\nSky will be coming to both the iPhone and iPad, and is expected to launch this winter. It\u2019ll be available on other platforms later on.\n"}
