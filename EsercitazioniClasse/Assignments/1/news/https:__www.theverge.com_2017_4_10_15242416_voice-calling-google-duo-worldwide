The feature was made available in Brazil only last month, but can now be accessed anywhere in the world, according to Duo\u2019s principal engineer, Justin Uberti. Voice calling can be found simply by switching a toggle at the top of the app\u2019s interface. \n\n\n   Google Duo's new audio calling feature now available worldwide! pic.twitter.com/gFQxQTcu2S\u2014 Justin Uberti (@juberti) April 10, 2017\n\n\n\nIt may seem a bit odd for Google to integrate voice calls into an app that was originally designed to put video chat front and center, but a) why not? Popular video chat apps like Skype and FaceTime already do the same, and b) if we know one thing about Google\u2019s approach to communication apps, it\u2019s that the company loves to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. \nAnd hey, if you don\u2019t want to make calls using Duo, you can still use Hangouts or Google Voice. And probably whatever new messaging app Google releases this year. \n"}
