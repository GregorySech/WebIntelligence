{"title": "Strange Beasts is yet another cautionary tale about augmented reality", "content": " \nTech giants are already touting virtual reality and augmented reality as the next huge frontiers for digital entertainment, and it\u2019s provided plenty of fodder for science fiction creators \u2014 look no further than Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cMen Against Fire.\u201d A new short film from London filmmaker Magali Barb\u00e9 looks at how lonely this future can be. \nStrange Beasts starts off as a typical tech CEO pitch introducing viewers to an augmented reality game called Strange Beasts. The CEO, Victor, explains that nanites inserted into the eye project images for the user, allowing them to create their own creatures and pets to play with. About halfway through, the video takes a turn as Victor introduces his daughter, highlighting how her imaginary creatures can interact with his own. It\u2019s in the last couple of minutes that the film reveals its twist, and shows that his life is emptier than it seems. \nThis certainly isn\u2019t the first story about AR in which the point is that the technology is terrible for the human race and society \u2014 just look at short films like 2012\u2019s Sight, last year\u2019s Hyper-Reality, and the aforementioned episode of Black Mirror as just a couple of examples. Strange Beasts presents a technology that is a bit more benign, but it\u2019s definitely still a cautionary tale.\n"}
