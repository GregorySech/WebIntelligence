{"title": "Google Pixel 2 vs. iPhone X vs. Galaxy S8: how the phones compare", "content": " \nGoogle has officially taken the wraps off the second generation of its Pixel smartphones \u2014 the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL. If the original Pixel was a chance for Google stop standing on the sidelines and show the rest of the world how to make a great smartphone, the Pixel 2 looks like what happens when you take an already great phone and put it through a year of refinement.\nOn the hardware front, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL look like they\u2019ll stand up next to any of their contemporaries from Apple or Samsung. Google included a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 processor, better displays, and a camera that somehow improves on the already stellar one found on the original Pixel. There are, of course, a few quibbles: Google has sadly followed Apple\u2019s lead in removing the 3.5mm headphone jack, and while the Pixel 2 XL features an edge-to-edge QHD OLED display, the regular Pixel is beset by bezels that feel particularly dated when compared to other 2017 flagship phones. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nExclusive first look at the Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL\n\nBut if Google\u2019s phone meets the competition when it comes to hardware, the company is hoping that its advantages in services and software \u2014 in particular AI and machine learning for things like Google Lens and Google Assistant \u2014 will be enough to make the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL stand out among the current crop of excellent smartphones. \nWhile it\u2019s too early to say which of 2017\u2019s smartphones will reign supreme, with the announcement of the Pixel 2, it\u2019s finally possible to see how the best phones from Apple, Google, Samsung, and more stack up head-to-head. And while specs never tell the full story, we\u2019ve put together a handy chart to help you decide which smartphone will get the coveted place in your pocket or bag. \nFor an exclusive look at all the new Google devices announced, check out our interview with CEO Sundar Pichai\n\n\nGoogle Pixel 2 spec comparison\n\n\n\nSpecification\nPixel 2 XL\nPixel 2\niPhone X\niPhone 8\niPhone 8 Plus\nGalaxy Note 8\nGalaxy S8\nGalaxy S8 Plus\nEssential Phone\nLG V30\nHTC U11\nPixel\nPixel XL\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\nPixel 2 XL\nPixel 2\niPhone X\niPhone 8\niPhone 8 Plus\nGalaxy Note 8\nGalaxy S8\nGalaxy S8 Plus\nEssential Phone\nLG V30\nHTC U11\nPixel\nPixel XL\n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n6.0 inches\n5.0 inches\n5.8 inches\n4.7 inches\n5.5 inches\n6.3 inches\n5.8 inches\n6.2 inches\n5.71 inches\n6 inches\n5.5 inches\n5 inches\n5.5 inches\n\n\nResolution\n2880 x 1440\n1920 x 1080\n2436 x 1125\n1334 x 750\n1920 x 1080\n2960 x 1440\n2960 x 1440\n2960 x 1440\n2560 x 1312\n2880 x 1440\n2560 x 1440\n1920 x 1080\n2560 x 1440\n\n\nProcessor\nSnapdragon 835 (2.35GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 835 (2.35GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nA11 Bionic\nA11 Bionic\nA11 Bionic\nSnapdragon 835 (2.35GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 835 (2.35GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 835 (2.35GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 835 (2.45GHz and 1.9GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 835\nSnapdragon 835 (2.45GHz, octa-core)\nSnapdragon 821 (quad-core)\nSnapdragon 821 (quad-core)\n\n\nRAM\n4GB\n4GB\n3GB\n2GB\n3GB\n6GB\n4GB\n4GB\n4GB\n4GB\n4GB, 6GB\n4GB\n4GB\n\n\nStorage\n64GB, 128GB\n64GB, 128GB\n64GB, 256GB\n64GB, 256GB\n64GB, 256GB\n64GB, 128GB, 256GB\n64GB\n64GB\n128GB\n64GB, 128GB\n64GB, 128GB\n32GB, 128GB\n32GB, 128GB\n\n\nRear camera\n12.2 megapixel\n12.2 megapixel\n12 megapixel, 12 megapixel (wide)\n12 megapixel\n12 megapixel, 12 megapixel (wide)\n12 megapixel, 12 megapixel (wide)\n12 megapixel\n12 megapixel\n13 megapixel, 13 megapixel (monochrome)\n16 megapixel, 13 megapixel (wide)\n12 megapixel\n12.3 megapixel\n12.3 megapixel\n\n\nFront camera\n8 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n7 megapixel\n7 megapixel\n7 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n5 megapixel\n16 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n8 megapixel\n\n\nBattery\n3520mAh\n2700mAh\n2716mAh\n1821mAh\n2675mAh\n3300mAh\n3000mAh\n3500mAh\n3040mAh\n3300mAh\n3000mAh\n2770mAH\n3450mAh\n\n\nWater protection\nIP67\nIP67\nIP67\nIP67\nIP67\nIP68\nIP68\nIP68\nN/A\nIP68\nIP67\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nWeight\n0.39 pounds\n0.32 pounds\n0.38 pounds\n0.33 pounds\n0.45 pounds\n0.43 pounds\n0.34 pounds\n0.38 pounds\n0.41 pounds\n0.35 pounds\n0.37 pounds\n0.31 pounds\n0.37 pounds\n\n\nDimensions (in.)\n6.20 x 3.00 x 0.30\n5.70 x 2.70 x 0.30\n5.65 x 2.79 x 0.30\n5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29\n6.24 x 3.07 x 0.30\n6.40 x 2.94 x 0.34\n5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31\n6.28 x 2.88 x 0.31\n5.57 x 2.80 x 0.31\n5.97 x 2.97 x 0.29\n6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31\n5.66 x 2.74 x 0.29\n6.09 x 2.98 x 0.29\n\n\nStarting price\n$849.00\n$649.00\n$999.00\n$699.00\n$799.00\n$930\n$749.00\n$849.00\n$699.00\nTBA (rumored $749.99)\n$649.00\n$649.00\n$769.00\n\n\nMisc.\nSqueezable sides, no headphone jack\nSqueezable sides, no headphone jack\nFace ID scanner, no headphone jack\nWireless charging, no headphone jack\nWireless charging, no headphone jack\nS Pen, Iris scanner, USB-C, wireless charging\nIris scanner, USB-C, wireless charging\nIris scanner, USB-C, wireless charging\nModular attachement system\nQuad DAC for Hi-Fi audio\nSqueezable side function\nGoogle Assistant, fast charging\nGoogle Assistant,  fast charging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection: Swapped Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 2 prices, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus RAM. \n"}
