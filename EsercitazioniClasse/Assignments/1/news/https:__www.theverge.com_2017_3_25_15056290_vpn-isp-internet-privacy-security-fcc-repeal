{"title": "A VPN can stop internet companies from selling your data \u2014 but it\u2019s not a magic bullet", "content": " \nEarlier this week, Congress voted to repeal privacy measures that would stop internet service providers from sharing their users\u2019 internet activity with third parties. Those rules were passed in October, but not only does this vote undo them, it prevents the FCC from reinstating similar rules in the future. This is great for broadband companies, but if you\u2019re one of these companies\u2019 users, what are you supposed to do?\nOne popular recommendation you might have heard is to use a virtual private network, or VPN. You can find a lot of comprehensive online explanations of what VPNs are, but in the simplest terms, they create a secure, encrypted connection between your computer (or phone, tablet, &c.) and a private server somewhere else, preventing anyone else from seeing or modifying that traffic. When you browse the internet, data goes to the server, which passes it securely back to you. When you send data out, it appears to come from the server, not your computer. While it doesn\u2019t make you anonymous \u2014 the VPN can see your traffic, and law enforcement can request information from VPN companies \u2014 it obscures what you\u2019re doing online.\nThe right VPN can protect against lots of things, including government surveillance and malware. But the tool isn\u2019t a magic privacy bullet \u2014 in fact, experts can\u2019t even agree on a great VPN service, beyond one you make yourself. While a huge number of companies provide VPNs, many have potential security flaws or could put your data at risk. It\u2019s also difficult to tell how secure a VPN actually is, and what it\u2019s doing with your data. So what are you supposed to do if you want to use one? The short answer is to avoid free services, and if you consider yourself tech-savvy, look into setting up your own. Otherwise, make sure a paid VPN has a privacy policy you\u2019re okay with, and can handle the threats you\u2019re relying on it to protect you from. And on a larger scale, remember that the best solution is still policies that would tackle the problem at the source: ISPs\u2019 ability to sell your data.\nIf you want some more background on all of this, read on.\nWhat do I need out of a VPN?\nIt depends on who \u201cyou\u201d are. Here are some of the many uses for VPNs:\n\nAvoiding government surveillance or censorship\nRemotely connecting to your company\u2019s private network\nProtecting your data on public Wi-Fi\nHiding BitTorrent piracy\nWatching movies from another country\u2019s Netflix library\n\nAll of these things present different challenges and security risks, and a VPN isn\u2019t even a good choice for some of them, since it doesn\u2019t make you anonymous.\n\u201cVPNs are essentially a way of moving your trust.\u201d\nBut here, we\u2019re talking about a very specific problem: how to stop internet service providers from mass-collecting information about perfectly legal things you do online. This is actually one of the simpler scenarios. You\u2019re not worried about an oppressive government targeting you for a sophisticated hack, or the VPN giving up information to law enforcement. You\u2019re not connecting to an unfamiliar Wi-Fi network that somebody could be siphoning data from. You\u2019re just trying to make your browsing history hard enough to see that an ISP won\u2019t automatically scoop it up and sell it to advertisers.\nFor this particular use, the central question is who will keep your data safer: an internet service provider, or a VPN company. \u201cVPNs are essentially a way of moving your trust,\u201d says Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, senior staff technologist at EFF. \u201cNormally, you trust your ISP not to snoop on you, but if you can't trust your ISP anymore, you can pay somebody else.\u201d An untrustworthy VPN could turn around and sell your data, just like an ISP. In fact, it could do much worse things, like use your bandwidth as part of a botnet. Many of them don\u2019t have a reputation to protect the way that ISPs do, and they\u2019re under significantly less scrutiny.\nWhich VPNs can I trust?\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to make recommendations about VPNs,\u201d says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Journalist Yael Grauer has a great, detailed rundown of the problems at Ars Technica, but one of the biggest issues is simply that VPN companies can be vague and non-transparent. They might oversell what their service does, obscure how their security works, or hide nefarious caveats in the terms of service. In the Ars Technica piece, security expert Kenneth White calls it \u201cPinky-Promise-as-a-Service,\u201d because there\u2019s often no outside evaluation. \u201cIt's really hard to know how to trust a given VPN provider,\u201d says Hoffman-Andrews. \u201cSome of them say that they don't log data or snoop on you in various ways, but it's hard for individuals to verify that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to make recommendations.\u201d\nA good VPN will also protect you from malware on public networks, but not every service is up to the task. White has also complained that many VPNs \u2014 including relatively well-known services like NordVPN, IPVanish, and PureVPN \u2014 connect their users using a single pre-shared key, which someone who controls a Wi-Fi network could use to decrypt their traffic. (NordVPN says it does not use pre-shared keys on its native apps, only for manuals setups that are being phased out.) If you\u2019re only planning to use it at home, Hall says the pre-shared key issue might be moot, since it\u2019s highly unlikely your ISP will outright try to hack you. He\u2019s a fan, for example, of the service Astrill, which appears on White\u2019s list.\nA free VPN should always raise a big red flag. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t cost you anything, wow, how are they making money off of routing your bandwidth?\u201d asks Hall. Evidence of external audits is also a good sign, although that\u2019s rare. VPN service Cloak \u2014 which costs around $10 a month for one person \u2014 is one of the rare examples of this. It announced an audit in early 2016, although the results weren\u2019t publicly released. Co-founder Dave Peck says that\u2019s because the audit applied to system architecture that has since been rewritten, and that it found the old system safe from their highest-priority threats, like the theft of customer data. He says a new audit will be conducted in the future.\nThe safest option is to set up your own VPN server and connect to it. \u201cWe recommend that if you have any technical capability whatsoever, you look into like Streisand and Algo,\u201d says Hall, listing two systems that let you \u201croll your own\u201d VPN. You\u2019ll pay for the nominal cost of a server, and have complete control over what happens to your data. But that\u2019s still a lot more trouble than just paying a monthly fee.\n\n\n\n\nWhat else can I do?\nIf you\u2019re really committed to total privacy but don\u2019t want to set up a server, you could always use something like Tor, which has the added benefit of anonymizing you. But it can be a much slower, less convenient browsing experience than most people are used to. Much more conveniently, you can make sure to use encrypted apps for individual services like chat \u2014 which is good practice for preventing all kinds of surveillance.\nWhile it isn\u2019t a perfect solution, sites that use HTTPS also limit the amount of information that ISPs can see \u2014 they can collect the general domain name and when you\u2019re visiting it, but not which individual pages you\u2019re on or what information you\u2019re sending. Additionally, if you\u2019re worried about ISPs gathering data, you should also take steps to minimize what actual websites and advertising platforms can track.\nBut there\u2019s no totally safe and super-simple technical way to have the same internet service you\u2019re used to while keeping ISPs in the dark. \u201cWe shouldn't have to buy trust as an add-on service,\u201d says Hoffman-Andrews. \u201cThat should be a default part of internet service just as it's a default part of phone service.\u201d\nUpdate March 27th 8:30AM ET: Added comment from NordVPN.\nUpdate March 30th 2:00PM ET: Updated with House vote.\n"}
