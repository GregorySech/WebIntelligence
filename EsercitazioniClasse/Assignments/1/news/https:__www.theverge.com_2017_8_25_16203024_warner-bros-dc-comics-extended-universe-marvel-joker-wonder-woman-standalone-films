{"title": "Following Wonder Woman, not Marvel, is the key to DC\u2019s cinematic survival", "content": " \nEarlier this week, news broke that Martin Scorsese would reportedly be producing a Joker origin-story film for Warner Bros. But the most interesting part of the announcement wasn\u2019t Scorsese\u2019s involvement, or the idea of digging into the Joker\u2019s history again \u2014 it was the fact that the planned prequel wouldn\u2019t be set in the existing DC Extended Universe film franchise, alongside Suicide Squad and Justice League. Instead, it\u2019d be part of a new sub-series of DC movies focused on unconnected original stories. Just after that, recent comments from The Batman director Matt Reeves resurfaced specifying that his upcoming Caped Crusader film would also be \u201cstandalone, it\u2019s not part of the extended universe.\u201d\nStandalone stories might be the studio\u2019s last chance at redeeming its flailing cinematic canon\nReeves has since tried to walk those comments back, but according to The Hollywood Reporter, it\u2019s still unclear where exactly the standalone Batman film will eventually land. That abrupt contradiction is strange, and suggests a studio without a fixed strategy in place for its biggest, most audience-friendly properties. The idea of standalone DC films even suggests that Warner Bros. might finally be throwing in the towel and admitting it can\u2019t play Marvel\u2019s game of building a vast saga out of popular, interconnected blockbusters. Given the current state of the DC Extended Universe, standalone stories might be the studio\u2019s last chance at redeeming its flailing cinematic canon.\nWarner Bros. wouldn\u2019t be the first studio to fail at copying Disney and Marvel\u2019s formula. Sony\u2019s Amazing Spider-Man films underperformed, to the point where it called in Marvel Studios to reboot the character again with this year\u2019s Spider-Man: Homecoming. Universal\u2019s misbegotten Dark Universe has already been rebooted once, and its relaunch with The Mummy was met with critical jeers and widespread indifference. The nascent Transformers cinematic universe is already off to an odd start, with Transformers: The Last Knight\u2019s attempts to build out the canon of the franchise backfiring into a slog of a film. And while the Godzilla / King Kong \u201cMonsterverse\u201d is still in the early stages, it looks like it\u2019ll have an uphill battle to mainstream success. It turns out that building an intricately plotted, fiscally successful series like the Marvel Cinematic Universe is harder than it looks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent history makes it clear why Warner Bros. might want to give up on the DCEU. While none of DC\u2019s films have done poorly at the box office, the four franchise installments to date have resulted in one outstanding feature with widespread critical acclaim (Wonder Woman), one with middling reviews (Man of Steel), and two that were widely crucified as awful. (Looking at you, Suicide Squad and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.) And while franchises like Transformers and Fast and Furious have proven that movies don\u2019t need to be intelligent, nuanced, or even coherent to be successful, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt, especially with comic-book films that rely on fan goodwill as such a big part of their audiences. \nDC films aren\u2019t competing at the same level as most other major blockbusters\nAnd like it or not, Warner Bros. does have to do something, because right now its DC films aren\u2019t competing at the same level as most other major blockbusters. Batman v Superman should have been an easy win. It combines two of the best-known superheroes of all time in a single film, and pits them against each other in a city-shaking grudge match. It was the most anticipated of the DCEU movies, but it failed to crack $1 billion worldwide. In contrast, Disney's flagship films regularly cross the $1B mark globally \u2014 The Avengers, The Force Awakens, Rogue One, Captain America: Civil War, Beauty and the Beast, and Zootopia are just a few to have hit the mark. And Universal has pulled it off with the last two Fast and Furious movies and Jurassic World. A movie that brings in $850 million is definitely successful, but BvS was projected to make so much more that it was considered a financial disappointment, to the point where Greg Silverman \u2014 the Warner Bros. executive in charge of the DCEU \u2014 was fired and the entire DC arm of the company was restructured. At the end of the day, Warner Bros has to answer investors asking \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this making Avengers money?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movie that may have shown the new path forward was Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins\u2019 film reaped the biggest box-office returns of the DCEU films, and was also the cheapest to produce. But Wonder Woman wasn\u2019t a hit because fans caught a glimpse of her in Batman v. Superman and were dying to see her origin story. It was a success because it told a compelling story about a beloved character, as seen through the eyes of director Patty Jenkins, a talented filmmaker with a strong, vibrant vision for the film.\nStart by making more films in the mold of Wonder Woman\nIt\u2019s wartime period-piece setting placed it apart from the rest of the films as a standalone story, in spite of the bookends tying it back to Justice League. By moving the story so far away from everything else in the DCEU aesthetically, chronologically, and thematically, Wonder Woman was able to leave behind the baggage of previous entries in the franchise and succeed like no other recent DCEU film has. If DC is looking for a pattern of success to emulate, it should stop looking at Marvel\u2019s seemingly impossible-to-replicate strategy, and start by making more films in the mold of Wonder Woman.\nAnd we\u2019ve already seen that shifting to a individual-movie approach can work on a critical, financial, and creative level. 20th Century Fox\u2019s attempts at big-budget, Avengers-style X-Men movies fizzled out with X-Men: Apocalypse, which grossed less than any other X-Men film besides First Class and The Wolverine. But on the flip side, the studio has found great success with Logan and Deadpool \u2014 movies that took strikingly different angles on the expected superhero tropes, and found great success with audiences and critics alike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a standalone approach, the 1980s hard-boiled crime film Deadline described as the plan for the Joker film would would work on a similar level as the World War I setting in Wonder Woman, or the gritty post-apocalyptic world in Logan. Instead of offering the same grey-and-grim style of most of DC\u2019s other films, standalone settings would let Warner Bros. change up genres, characters, settings, and even actors without having to worry about maintaining continuity across a dozen films, or asking audiences to do hours of homework to understand what\u2019s going on in the next big team-up. A gritty Joker origin story may be a terrible idea for many other reasons, but from a conceptual angle, at least it\u2019s something new.\nWhat\u2019s more, if DC does shift to more varied, one-off films that draw on directorial vision and a variety of genres, it could give the company a big one-up on Marvel, which historically has struggled with ceding control to a director. At this point, Marvel Studios makes a certain type of film, and anyone who doesn\u2019t gel with that mandate doesn\u2019t end up working with the studio. Consider Edgar Wright\u2019s departure from Ant-Man, or Joss Whedon\u2019s well-publicized Age of Ultron fatigue. Before Patty Jenkins went to DC to direct Wonder Woman, Marvel had her set to direct Thor 2. But the company let her slip through its fingers over creative differences \u2014 leaving us with the mediocre Thor: The Dark World instead. More recently, acclaimed Selma director Ava DuVernay passed on Black Panther out of concerns that creative compromises would keep the movie from being \u201can Ava DuVernay film.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit of Marvel\u2019s control is that its films are comparatively consistent in quality, tone, and vision, because there\u2019s a single person guiding the entire process like a showrunner. Warner Bros. and DC simply just doesn\u2019t have a Kevin Feige. Instead of one vision, DC has a conflicting mess of too many cooks, with studio execs, Geoff Johns, Zack Snyder, Ben Affleck and more all running different parts of the show at different times. Warner Bros. can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 you can\u2019t have a single, unified, overarching universe with dozens of people pulling it in a dozen directions. Unless the studio is willing to cede creative control to a Kevin Feige of its own (and reports of heavy-handed oversight on films like Suicide Squad suggest it isn\u2019t) standalone films may just be the best fit for Warner Bros.\u2019 culture.\nAnd they would also give Warner more of a chance at bringing audiences a diverse, memorable slate of films to contrast with Marvel\u2019s slate. After almost 10 years and 16 films, MCU installments are run by formula. Audiences walking into Doctor Strange or Ant-Man pretty much knew what they\u2019ll be getting \u2014 Marvel\u2019s signature blend of action, humor, and world-ending stakes, neatly wrapped up in the third act with enough room for a sequel and a reference or two to an Infinity Stone. More recent efforts, like James Gunn\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy films or Taika Waititi\u2019s reportedly mold-breaking Thor: Ragnarok, are trying to edge further from the formula. But Marvel still has a way to go before any MCU films feel like directorial projects, rather than studio projects.\nIf Warner Bros. wants to compete, its leadership might consider Wonder Woman\u2019s lessons\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that DC\u2019s pivot away from its Extended Universe plan won\u2019t actually play out at the theaters. The Joker prequel is still in its extremely early stages, and Reeves backed down on his claims of independence. (That\u2019s reminiscent of the way Sony announced its Spider-Man spinoff films would be set in the MCU, until Kevin Feige publicly shot down the idea.) Given that DC already has far more movies on its slate than it has directors, scripts, or even release dates, let alone any active production, all these plans are still up in the air.\nBut if the last 10 years of genre films have taught us anything, it\u2019s that beating Marvel at its game is difficult \u2014 and maybe impossible, given how firmly the MCU is based in the specific visions of talented people trying to forge something new, rather than imitating an industry leader. If Warner Bros. wants to compete, its leadership might consider Wonder Woman\u2019s lessons, and try a different approach, rather than sticking with the one that isn\u2019t working.\n\n"}
