{"title": "Google Maps is testing video reviews with Local Guides", "content": " \nGoogle has launched a new feature for its Local Guides program that allows users to submit videos up to 30 seconds in length. As spotted by TechCrunch, Google made the feature available a couple weeks ago without much fanfare, but it\u2019s now notifying users via email.\nUp until this point, only photos could be attached to locations on Google Maps. People are already used to a short video format on personal networks to share glimpses into restaurants, hotels, or landmark destinations. It makes sense that now, you\u2019d also be able to highlight, say, a restaurant\u2019s trademark table side dish being prepped with a short clip on Google Maps.\nAs TechCrunch notes, up to 10 seconds of video can be recorded directly through the Google Maps app, and up to 30 seconds of video can be uploaded from your camera roll. To record or upload a video, search for and choose a place in Google Maps, tap \u201cadd a photo,\u201d then the camera icon. A bubble then appears that says \u201cNew! Hold for video.\u201d\nThe videos can also be used for personal reviews on Google Maps and TechCrunch says Google is testing the video with some businesses, as well. This is the latest expansion to Google\u2019s Local Guides program, which introduced a rewards system for regular users in late 2015.\n"}
