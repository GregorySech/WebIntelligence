{"title": "Gene-editing tool CRISPR can now manipulate more types of genetic material", "content": " \nThe powerful gene-editing tool CRISPR has been making headlines for its ability to edit DNA, which could one day transform how we fight cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Now, scientists have created a new version of CRISPR that can target and edit a different genetic building block: RNA.\nThe new tool, described in a study published today in Science, offers several advantages: its edits, for instance, aren\u2019t permanent, which makes gene editing much safer. Researchers showed that the new system, called REPAIR, can work relatively efficiently in human cells. In the future, it could be used to treat diseases, as well as better understand the role that RNA plays in causing those diseases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another tool in the toolbox.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s another tool in the toolbox that we didn\u2019t have access to before,\u201d says Mitchell O'Connell, assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Rochester, who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s like developing new technology that makes you see things that you couldn't see before, or tweak things that you couldn't tweak.\u201d\nThe gene-editing tool CRISPR is based on a defense mechanism bacteria use to ward off viruses by cutting off bits of their DNA and pasting them elsewhere. Scientists have engineered that mechanism to tweak DNA, creating unusually muscular beagles, for instance, and mosquitoes that don\u2019t transmit malaria. But there are different types of CRISPR, with different types of molecular scissors. The gene-editing tool that\u2019s been making lots of headlines is called CRISPR-Cas9. The CRISPR used in today\u2019s study is called CRISPR-Cas13.\nInstead of snipping DNA, this type of CRISPR targets another of the major biological molecules found in all forms of life, RNA. Most of the time, RNA is used inside the body to help DNA build proteins. And proteins play an important role in causing diseases. There are some advantages to editing RNA instead of DNA, says study co-author David Cox, a PhD student in the Zhang Lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which has been doing pioneering work on CRISPR. RNA is constantly being made and recycled inside cells, so an RNA edit is not permanent. (The edits could still be effective, though: the CRISPR system could be kept in cells for, say, months, allowing the scissors to keep editing RNA as it forms.) That makes the whole process safer. If you edit RNA and make a mistake, for instance, the faulty RNA will be degraded likely within 24 hours. Instead, if you edit DNA and make a mistake, that mistake is irreversible and could possible lead to cancer. Certain changes to DNA could also be passed on to future generations, while changes to RNA generally aren\u2019t passed on. \n\u201cthere are still big risks involved.\u201d\nGene editing \u201cis very exciting, but there are still big risks involved,\u201d O'Connell tells The Verge. Targeting RNA rather than DNA is \u201ca safer strategy, particularly for things where you might not want to make permanent change.\u201d\nTo create the new editing tool, called REPAIR, the researchers combined CRISPR-Cas13 with a protein called ADAR. It works this way: the Cas13 enzyme is programmed to target a specific RNA sequence that might correspond to a disease mutation; the ADAR protein then makes the edit. In the study, the researchers showed that the system can edit specific RNA bases with 20 to 40 percent efficiency \u2014 and up to 90 percent in some instances, says Cox. And the system made few mistakes: even though gene-editing tools are very precise, sometimes they snip pieces of genetic code they weren\u2019t programmed to cut. These off-target cuts can be dangerous, and scientists want to make sure there are as few of them as possible. \nA first version of REPAIR caused nearly 20,000 off-target cuts, says study co-author Omar Abudayyeh, also a PhD student in the Zhang Lab. \u201cThat was a pretty disappointing moment,\u201d he tells The Verge. But then, the team tweaked the system in a way that reduced the number of off-target cuts to 10 to 20 per target site, making it much more precise \u2014 and safe. \nO'Connell says he was surprised by how well the system works. RNA has been targeted before in an effort to make drugs to treat disease, O'Connell says. But this CRISPR system makes the whole editing process much easier. In the future, this editing tool could be used to treat life-threatening diseases like hemophilia, as well as a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can lead to sudden death, Cox tells The Verge. Before that happens, the system needs to be optimized, and made much more precise. Researchers also need to show that it works in mice, other animals, and eventually in people. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road to translate this into any sort of therapy,\u201d says study co-author Jonathan Gootenberg, another PhD student in the Zhang Lab.\n\u201cYou feel so empowered where you\u2019re in the lab.\u201d\nTogether with CRISPR-Cas9, this system really has the potential to revolutionize how we treat diseases. And that\u2019s the motivation that keeps Gootenberg, Cox, and Abudayyeh working hard in their lab. Abudayyeh says that when he was in med school, he met a woman with terminal lung cancer, who had maybe a few more months to live. \u201cYou feel pretty hopeless in that situation because there\u2019s nothing you can do even as a doctor,\u201d he says. But that\u2019s also what inspired him to get into biotechnology.\n\u201cYou feel so empowered where you\u2019re in the lab, just thinking about new ways to make new technologies with the potential to hopefully actually help patients like that,\u201d Abudayyeh says. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n"}
