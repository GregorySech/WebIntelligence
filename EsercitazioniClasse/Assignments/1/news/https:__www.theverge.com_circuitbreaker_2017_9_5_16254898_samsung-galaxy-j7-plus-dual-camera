{"title": "Samsung\u2019s second dual-camera smartphone is the Galaxy J7 Plus", "content": " \nSamsung has announced its next phone with a dual-camera setup, the Galaxy J7 Plus. Unlike the Note 8, which comes with two 12-megapixel cameras, the J7 Plus features a 13-megapixel shooter alongside a 5-megapixel lens that will allow you to readjust the focus on your shots after you take them. \nThe rest of the phone shouldn\u2019t be looked over, either. It includes a 2.39GHz octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and the ability to be logged into two accounts in apps like Instagram and WhatsApp at the same time. \nWith a 5.5-inch FHD super AMOLED display, all-metal design, 3,000mAh battery, and a sub-$400 price tag, the J7 Plus is one of the better midrange smartphone options available today. But given that it\u2019s currently only available in Thailand, most people won\u2019t be able to get their hands on it for a while. The Galaxy J7 Plus will be available on September 22nd. \n"}
