{"title": "Young Mars warmed by methane bursts might have flowed with water", "content": " \nBillions of years ago, when Mars was a frozen ball of ice, massive plumes of methane might have caused mysterious warm spells that let liquid water flow, a new study says. The research could help scientists understand how and when conditions on Mars were suitable for life. \nThese transient bouts of global warming may be connected to Mars\u2019 wobbly axis, according to a new model of young Mars\u2019 climate published today in the journal Nature Geoscience. The planet\u2019s shifting tilt exposed more of its surface to the Sun\u2019s rays, thawing subsurface reservoirs of frozen methane, the study suggests. The methane gas then escaped into the atmosphere and mixed with carbon dioxide, another powerful heat-trapping greenhouse gas \u2014 triggering spurts of widespread warming lasting several hundred thousand years. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox, an unresolved paradox of Mars.\u201d\nToday, Mars is a cold and barren place, but the planet started out relatively warmer and wetter. NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover and Mars orbiters, in fact, have spotted creases and valleys of river deltas that were likely carved over thousands of years by liquid water. Some of these features, however, date to about 3.6 to 3 billion years ago, when Mars was thought to be completely frozen. This evidence of liquid water suggests that Mars might have experienced periodic warm spells during an otherwise icy period \u2014 but so far, no one has been able to figure out exactly how. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox, an unresolved paradox of Mars,\u201d says Kevin Zahnle, a NASA scientist who was not involved in the study. \u201cOn the one hand, some people say that it looked warmish and wettish, at least occasionally. On another hand, nobody can figure out how it could have been warmish and wettish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSediment deposited into ancient lakes on Mars.\nImage: NASA/Caltech/JPL/MSSS\n\n\nOne explanation was that volcanoes might have spewed out enough greenhouse gases to warm the planet and melt the ice. But volcanoes couldn\u2019t have produced global warming lasting thousands of years, the study says. Asteroid impacts would have warmed the planet for even less time. \nThere is another possibility: global warming produced by massive quantities of methane in the atmosphere, says Edwin Kite, a planetary scientist at the University of Chicago and lead author of today\u2019s study. Earlier this year, research led by Robin Wordsworth at Harvard University revealed that methane \u2014 when mixed with carbon dioxide \u2014 could have been a much stronger greenhouse gas on Mars than previously thought. That strengthened the case Kite and planetary scientist Peter Gao were building for methane\u2019s role in warming up the Red Planet. \n\u201cNobody can figure out how it could have been warmish and wettish.\u201d\nMethane on Mars is the subject of a decades-old debate with exceptionally high stakes: if there\u2019s methane on Mars, it could be a sign of life there, too. Here on Earth, most of the methane in the atmosphere is produced when living things die and decay. But the methane that Kite was interested in is different: it wouldn\u2019t have been created by living things, but by chemical reactions between rocks and water deep beneath the planet\u2019s crust. Methane produced by these reactions may have traveled towards the surface, where it became trapped in a layer of ice.\nFor this methane to be released into the atmosphere, the ice had to thaw. That could have happened when Mars wobbled on its axis, according to Kite\u2019s models \u2014 tilting so that the Sun hit more of the planet\u2019s surface. Just like the Earth, Mars spins around a tilted axis as it orbits the Sun. That tilt is the reason for our seasons: the northern hemisphere experiences summer, for example, when the Earth\u2019s tilt exposes the globe\u2019s northern half to more of the Sun\u2019s energy. \nOur planet\u2019s tilt is more or less stabilized by our massive, orbiting Moon \u2014 which acts like an anchor. But Mars\u2019 two small and misshapen moons aren\u2019t as effective. So sometimes, Mars wobbles wildly. Kite\u2019s calculations suggest that these wobbles could have triggered enough warming to thaw some of the ice beneath the surface. That in turn released the methane trapped inside \u2014 kicking off a bout of global warming that could last hundreds of thousands of years. These warm spells would end when the Sun\u2019s light broke down the methane molecules.\n\u201cHabitable doesn't mean inhabited!\u201d\nSince water is key for life here on Earth, these warm spells could have created a habitable environment on Mars. Of course, \u201chabitable doesn't mean inhabited!\u201d Kite writes in an email to The Verge, but it helps explain the conditions in which life might have existed. \nThe study is pretty solid, Alberto Fair\u00e9n, an astrobiologist and visiting scientist at Cornell University, says in an email to The Verge. These methane bursts may have been one piece of a complicated combination of factors that allowed liquid water to flow, he wrote in a commentary published alongside the study. However, Kite points out there are no direct observations that this methane reservoir actually existed. The study is primarily based on computer modeling. \u201cThat is probably the biggest weakness of our model,\u201d Kite says. \u201cAll our evidence is indirect.\u201d\nZahnle doesn\u2019t think that the paradox of Mars\u2019 warm wet spells has been resolved yet. The problem is that to explain them, the planet\u2019s atmosphere would need to contain a substantial amount of CO2 that isn\u2019t present on Mars today. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem because nobody knows where all that CO2 has gone to,\u201d Zahnle says. \nStill, Zahnle says, \u201cThey\u2019re very clever, this is a good effort.\u201d And the model will be put to the test soon enough. The European Space Agency\u2019s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which is currently looping around Mars, is equipped with a methane sniffer. The probe is due to settle into a closer, circular orbit around the planet in March 2018. If its instruments don\u2019t detect any methane in Mars\u2019s atmosphere, then \u201cour model is very unlikely to be correct,\u201d says Kite. \u201cIf there is a quick way to prove our model, I don\u2019t know what it is \u2014 but there is a quick way to disprove it.\u201d\n"}
