{"title": "Are \u2018safer\u2019 hurricanes more damaging?", "content": " \nAfter Irma and Harvey and Maria, there\u2019s another hurricane on the horizon: Hurricane Nate, which is expected to make landfall this weekend. \nCompared to the others, Nate doesn\u2019t seem as powerful: Irma sustained speeds of 185 mph, while Nate\u2019s force is estimated at 80 mph (a Category 1 hurricane instead of Category 5). But don\u2019t be fooled by the seemingly low number.\nFirst of all, though winds are frightening, it\u2019s the water that really causes the damage, and the potential deaths. The winds last a few days, but the flooding and the storm surges can last for much longer. According to the National Hurricane Center, about 88 percent of hurricane deaths from 1963 to 2012 in the US were caused by the water, not the winds. This is already the case with Nate, which has caused 22 deaths in Central America already, mostly from flooding. \nInterestingly, \u201csafer\u201d hurricanes in general tend to lead to more damage, according to a 2005 study from the Southern Economic Journal. The researchers note that though hurricanes have become less deadly, the cost of damages have increased over time. By 1995, for example, there was already more hurricane damage in the five years of the \u201890s than in the two previous decades combined. Why?\nThe scientists conclude that precisely because forecasting and other scientific advances have made hurricanes less deadly, the cost of living along these coasts is lower \u2014 which means more people live there, which means more property to damage. \n"}
