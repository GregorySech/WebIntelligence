In between talk of what all these choices mean and why they\u2019re important, the company gave us previews of how we can expect to see it executed. From the looks of it, Microsoft is experimenting with the design of a new email client, file system, and desktop, among other things. We took screenshots of everything we could find that looked new and clearly spoke to the company\u2019s design choices. The desktop is particularly whoa.
