{"title": "How Facebook fought to keep political ads in the shadows", "content": " \nFacing mounting criticism, Mark Zuckerberg announced last week that Facebook will overhaul its approach to political ads, bringing more transparency to the process. Facebook users will soon be able to see who paid for an ad, Zuckerberg said, and when users visit an advertiser\u2019s page, they will be able to see all of the ads that those advertisers are running. The changes were announced as lawmakers were considering similar regulatory measures. \nOnline political ads have long been given less scrutiny\nThose may seem like minor changes compared to the requirements long placed on political ads in other mediums, like TV and print, which must include disclaimers on their ads. Online political ads, however, have historically been far more opaque. \u201cThe inadequacy of the FEC\u2019s current regulations makes it practically impossible for both regulators and citizens to determine if the funding for a political advertisement online came from a domestic source or an enemy abroad,\u201d former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel wrote in a column for Politico before the announcement. \nFacebook\u2019s policy changes and lawmakers\u2019 calls for new rules illustrate just how much has changed in a decade \u2014 for both Facebook and government regulators. When the FEC instituted rules in 2006 governing political advertising on the internet, it took a light-touch approach, and was even hailed for it. Many feared that government overreach would put internet users like political bloggers into legal jeopardy. Instead, the agency\u2019s rules forced campaigns to disclose when they bought ads, but imposed few special restrictions. The Washington Post wrote that \u201cthe vote drew praise from most ideological quarters, as well as from several watchdog groups.\u201d \nFacebook was at an infantile phase in 2006\nFacebook was still at an infantile phase of development in 2006. That September, the company started making accounts available to anyone older than 13 with a valid email address, after previously supporting only certain addresses. Even as the company rapidly expanded, it argued that it could not find a workable way to make its ads more transparent. In 2011, attorneys for the company wrote to the FEC to request that the agency formally allow political ads to continue being displayed without disclaimers. The company\u2019s filing argued that \u201ca disclaimer on Facebook ads would be inconvenient and impracticable.\u201d Earlier, Google had made a similar argument about search ads, although it included URLs to more information, and the FEC did not stop either from continuing as they had before. The companies argued, mostly successfully, that their ads should be regulated in ways \u201cmore akin to skywriting\u201d than TV commercials, says Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation. \nBut as online platforms grew, controversy began to arise over the exact borders of those rules. In 2012, a pro-coal group ran ads on YouTube that were critical of Democrats, raising questions over whether the videos needed a disclaimer, since they appeared only on the internet and were posted for free. The FEC was ultimately deadlocked in a partisan 3-3 decision, leaving the door open for similar ads. \u201cThey were essentially told, \u2018it\u2019s all good,\u2019\u201d Ravel says. \nIn 2014, after some updates were proposed, Republicans came out to oppose any changes, as did some civil liberties groups, which again argued that changes would come dangerously close to infringing on free speech. \u201cThis could have a huge impact on free and low-cost online political speech, especially if new regulations place complicated and burdensome record-keeping and disclosure requirements on bloggers, YouTube posters, or other online speakers, including those who post anonymously,\u201d the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote. \nAnother overhaul may be on the table\nNow, it seems, some sort of overhaul may again be on the table. FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub recently looked to reopen the process for creating new rules. \u201cIt has been more than a decade since the commission has fully examined how best to regulate political spending on the Internet \u2014 an eternity in online years,\u201d she wrote in an accompanying Washington Post op-ed. Still, Ravel says she\u2019s skeptical that it will amount to anything more than an extremely narrow change. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says. \nA group of Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, wrote to the FEC last week requesting new guidelines for political ads. Some lawmakers may go even further: The Washington Post reports that new legislation being considered would regulate political ads online. \nIn that context, it\u2019s easy to see Facebook\u2019s changes to political ads as an attempt to self-impose regulations before the government can force its hand. The change may be a belated one, considering how Facebook has argued for so long that restrictions like disclaimers are impractical. \u201cFor political committees, the Internet has become \u2018the most accessible marketplace of ideas in history,\u2019\u201d Facebook wrote in its 2011 FEC filing. In light of the news about Russian advertisements, it seems Facebook underestimated just how accessible their platform has become. \n"}
