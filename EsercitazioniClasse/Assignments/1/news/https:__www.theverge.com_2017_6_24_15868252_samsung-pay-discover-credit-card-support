{"title": "Samsung Pay now supports Discover cards", "content": " \nDiscover card shoppers can finally use their credit card with Samsung Pay on their phones \u2014 two years after the credit card company announced that the card would come to the system. \nA customer service representative for Discover confirmed that customers can now add their cards to Samsung Pay. Samsung unveiled its mobile payment system in 2015, and Discover announced at the time that support for the card would come in early 2016. However, that functionality was delayed until now, prompting some complaints from users.\nLike Android Pay, Apple Pay, or Google Wallet, Samsung Pay use Near Field Communications to securely transmit the card information to a retailer. However, not all retailers have activated their NFC systems, which can leave customers guessing. To get around this, Samsung Pay also uses something called Magnetic Secure Transmission, which works with a regular credit card terminal.\n"}
