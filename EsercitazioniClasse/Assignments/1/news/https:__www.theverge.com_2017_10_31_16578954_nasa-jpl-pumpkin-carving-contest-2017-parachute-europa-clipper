{"title": "NASA engineers create a parachuting pumpkin for their annual Halloween contest", "content": " \nIt\u2019s that time of year again when NASA scientists compete to make the most creative, the most technologically challenging, and the most impressive pumpkin display of them all. This year, pumpkins spun, floated, and sailed like ships in the seventh annual (unofficial) pumpkin carving contest at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \nThe rules of the pumpkin carving contest are simple, says Pete Waydo, deputy section manager of spacecraft mechanical engineering at JPL and a judge of the contest. Contestants can pick up their pumpkins a week before the competition and start assembling their displays, but only on the day of the contest can they actually work on their pumpkins \u2014 in just one hour. Other than that, Waydo says, \u201cThere are no rules.\u201d\n\n\nAttention all nerds: the @NASAJPL Mechanical Engineering Sections Annual Pumpkin Carving Contest is TODAY! Stay tuned for some #NASAPumpkin! pic.twitter.com/iccEGQKlHn\u2014 Aaron Yazzie (@YazzieSays) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nThe competition is a way for scientists to let off steam \u2014 by doing more science, Waydo says. \u201cIf you look at the entries over the years, you'll see a lot of creative use of the kind of technologies that we use in research for spaceflight \u2014 applied to the pumpkins,\u201d he says. And over the past few years, the competition has only gotten steeper. \u201cIt has also forced people to really up their games, so we get some really intense, crazy, off-the-hook creations,\u201d he says. \nThe winner this year is a pirate pumpkin ship floating on a sea of dry ice meant to represent Europa, Jupiter\u2019s icy ocean moon. The ship represents a 19th century trading vessel called a clipper ship, a play on the name for NASA\u2019s mission to investigate whether Europa is capable of sustaining life: Europa Clipper.\n\n\nI am so loving this @NASAEuropa pumpkin at @NASAJPL #pumpkincarving #Halloween pic.twitter.com/sa9FWxRBZ8\u2014 Elizabeth Landau (@lizlandau) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nAnother pumpkin in the contest spoke to the fears of many at JPL\u2019s Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group. That\u2019s the team of people tasked with ensuring that Earth\u2019s microbes don\u2019t travel to other worlds and that alien microbes don\u2019t find their way here. Their pumpkin display is meant to resemble the NASA InSight lander, which is scheduled to launch next year. But here, it\u2019s covered in terrifying, gourd-like spores from Earth. \n\n\n.Spore-covered @NASAInSight #NASAPumpkin pic.twitter.com/lmWxft6ADf\u2014 Aaron Yazzie (@YazzieSays) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nThis flower-shaped pumpkin is an homage to NASA\u2019s starshade, a space-based device intended to make taking photos of exoplanets easier. It\u2019s just a concept right now, but it\u2019s designed to work with space telescopes to shut out distracting starlight and let the dim light of an exoplanet shine through. \n\n\n.Starshade Petal Unfurling #NASAPumpkin pic.twitter.com/IJcHSuEaBu\u2014 Aaron Yazzie (@YazzieSays) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nIf Martians were to collect the wreckage left behind by human explorations of Mars, it would look something like this pumpkin: sticking out is the wheel from the 1997 Sojourner Rover, gadgets from previous missions like the Mars Phoenix lander, \u201cand a bunch of other odds and ends,\u201d Waydo says. There are also models of sample tubes planned for the upcoming Mars2020 mission, to investigate whether microbes ever lived on Mars. \n\n\n.Mars Waste Management #NASAPumpkin. Mars\u2019 way of cleaning up all the junk we send there! pic.twitter.com/zBlAVm0MeC\u2014 Aaron Yazzie (@YazzieSays) October 30, 2017\n\n\n\nOne of Waydo\u2019s favorite pumpkins was created by a team of scientists specializing in entry, descent, and landing of spacecraft. These are the experts on entering Mars\u2019 atmosphere, and landing safely on its surface, Waydo says. The team attached a parachute to their pumpkin, and hovered it over a blower. \u201cIt was like one of those indoor skydiving places,\u201d Waydo says. \u201cYou could hang the pumpkin there on the parachute and it would free-fly indefinitely there.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo courtesy of Peter Waydo, NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n\nOf course, these are professional scientists and engineers, so don\u2019t be discouraged by your own orange, snaggle-toothed creation. But, if you want to start prepping for a more impressive pumpkin next year, NASA has some tips. \n\n"}
