{"title": "The Razer Phone might have 120Hz refresh rate, like the iPad Pro", "content": " Razer will likely announce its first smartphone tomorrow, November 1st, but last-minute leaks keep coming. Phandroid spotted that UK phone dealer 3G leaked the phone's specs early, and apparently, the device will feature a display with a relatively unprecedented 120Hz refresh rate. This is the same rate as the iPad Pro 10.5, which people loved, and a new phone from Sharp called the Aquos R Compact, which will be released in December in Japan. A high refresh rate is valuable for gaming and reducing lag, so it makes sense that Razer would prioritize the display. The spec listing also suggests the phone will include support for Dolby Atmos sound through front-facing stereo speakers and amplifiers certified by THX. Again, this will likely be useful for a more intense gaming experience and movie watching. We previously thought the phone would have a single rear-facing camera, but it now seems like it'll include a dual-camera system with a 12-megapixel wide angle lens and a 13-megapixel zoom sensor. Overall, we're expecting the phone to feature 8GB of RAM \u2014 as much as a MacBook Pro \u2014 a Snapdragon 835 processor, a 5.7-inch display, a 4,000mAh battery, 64GB of internal storage, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. It'll resemble a Nextbit Robin, which isn't surprising given that Razer acquired the company earlier this year. We'll hopefully have all the official specs and images tomorrow."}
