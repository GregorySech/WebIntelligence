{"title": "This Discord bot turns Pok\u00e9mon into a text-based adventure", "content": " \nIf you\u2019re looking to sneak in a little Pok\u00e9mon time without busting out a handheld device or phone, there\u2019s a Discord bot for that. Pok\u00e9World offers a stripped-down version of the classic catch \u2018em all RPG, a text-only version that can be enjoyed at your own leisure. \nTo play, Discord users can either log onto the main Pok\u00e9World server, or invite the bot onto a server of their own. It plays like a simplified, word-based version of the games. Users input text commands, which the bot dutifully communicates often, to explore the game\u2019s world, battle, and of course capture pok\u00e9mon. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA California-based programmer who goes by \u201cBioblaze Payne\u201d created the bot; they started the project in late July and had a prototype completed with all 151 original pok\u00e9mon in less than 24 hours. \u201cIt was a proof of concept,\u201d Bioblaze tells The Verge via email. The next day, about 60 people were playing it. From there, Bioblaze says it was another week or so to upgrade the bot from a proof-of-concept to an actual alpha. \n\u201cCurrently on Discord, the concept of a game is more or less something with a random number generator, or randomly pulling from a list,\u201d Bioblaze says. \u201cSome do store stats, and information. But none of them are really what you would call a Fully Functional Game.\u201d Pok\u00e9World is a game in the old-fashioned sense, one that relies on your own imagination and input more than visuals. But it\u2019s an engaging project, and it makes it easy to pass time via Discord while surfing the web or working from an office. \nCurrently, it supports seven regions from the series, and Bioblaze says it\u2019s drawn the attention of more than 22,000 players. Bioblaze says they\u2019ll continue improving the game, including revamping command structures and focusing more on an MMO aspect. \u201cIRC seems to have died out. Ventrillo, Teamspeak, Skype, Slack, Raidcall all seem to have no real focus for gamers anymore,\u201d Bioblaze says. \n\u201cSince Discord is more or less made for gamers, and the servers are aplenty, I felt like Discord is the new IRC. I wanted to bring a part of my childhood, of my history, back into the world, and rekindle that feeling I had back on IRC, with everyone I knew.\u201d \n"}
