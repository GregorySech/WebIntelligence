{"title": "Did you miss yesterday\u2019s total solar eclipse? Here\u2019s your next chance", "content": " \nYesterday, the US experienced one of the biggest astronomical events of the decade: a total solar eclipse that crossed the country from coast to coast for the first time since 1918. If you\u2019re heartbroken you missed it, don\u2019t worry. You ought to get a few other chances over your lifetime. \nTotal solar eclipses happen every 18 months or so, when the Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun on its orbit around our planet. If you\u2019re in the direct path of the Moon\u2019s shadow \u2014 called the path of totality \u2014 you will see the Sun go dark. Often, however, the path of totality goes over the ocean or Antarctica. So that\u2019s why whenever a total solar eclipse crosses easily reachable areas, it\u2019s such a big deal. And one that shouldn\u2019t be missed. \nSo if you didn\u2019t catch totality yesterday, here are the next total solar eclipses that will cross at least part of the continental US. \nApril 8th, 2024\nThe next total solar eclipse to cross the United States will take place in fewer than seven years. This eclipse will also be visible from Mexico and a tiny slice of Canada. Seven years isn\u2019t too far ahead to start planning for it. And remember: last-minute travel plans aren\u2019t a great idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path of totality for the April 8th, 2024 solar eclipse.\nMap: Eclipsewise\n\n\nAugust 12th, 2045\nThe next big total solar eclipse to cross the continental US from coast to coast again is a little more far off into the future. The path of totality for this one is pretty similar to yesterday\u2019s eclipse, but a bit more to the South. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path of totality for the August 12th, 2045 solar eclipse.\nMap: Eclipsewise\n\n\nMarch 30th, 2052\nOkay, this is really far off into the future, but maybe you\u2019ll still be around? Totality will barely touch the US, but you could get a glimpse of it in southern Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path of totality for the March 30th, 2052 solar eclipse.\nMap: Eclipsewise\n\n\nMore total eclipses will cross just a few states in 2078 and 2079 as well. It\u2019ll be a treat if you\u2019ve got really good genes and are still roaming the planet then. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap: GretAmericanEclipse.com\n\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to wait for eclipses to cross the US. In fact, a total solar eclipse will cross Chile and Argentina on July 2nd, 2019. Then another one will pass over Chile and Argentina again on December 14th, 2020. Talk about luck. \nSo if you suffered from eclipse FOMO yesterday, start planning now for the future. I was in New York and only saw a partial eclipse. Now I know where I\u2019ll be on April 8th, 2024. \n"}
