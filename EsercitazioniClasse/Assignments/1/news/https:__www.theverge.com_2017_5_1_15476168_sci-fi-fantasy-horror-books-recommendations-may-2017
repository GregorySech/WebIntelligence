{"title": "31 science fiction, fantasy, and horror books to read this May", "content": " \nIt\u2019s May. The temperatures have risen nicely here, which means that I get to take my stack of books outdoors and enjoy the sunshine while I\u2019m tearing through my to-read list. \nI\u2019ve recently begun to reread an older book that\u2019s been all the rage lately, American Gods by Neil Gaiman. I\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve seen of the Starz show, but because it\u2019s been years since I\u2019d picked up the book, I wanted to familiarize myself. It\u2019s always a bit tricky, going back to a book you have fond memories of. Sometimes, those memories just don\u2019t hold up for you. Fortunately, Gaiman\u2019s novel is just as interesting and engrossing as it was all those years ago when I first picked it up. \nHere are 31 novels that are hitting bookstores this month.   \nMay 2nd\nCity of Miracles by Robert Jackson Bennett\nRobert Jackson Bennett has earned a considerable amount of acclaim for his Divine Cities novels (City of Stairs and City of Blades), and he\u2019s bringing his trilogy to a close with City of Miracles.
