{"title": "Samus Returns is a confident throwback to Metroid\u2019s roots", "content": " \nAfter years of neglect, Metroid is back: yesterday Nintendo revealed two new entries in the iconic sci-fi exploration series. One, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch, isn\u2019t due for some time. But the Nintendo 3DS title Samus Returns is launching on September 15th, and it\u2019s not just the first proper Metroid game since 2010 \u2014 it\u2019s also a return to the series\u2019s roots. Samus Returns is a remake of Metroid II on the original Game Boy, and it\u2019s the first traditional 2D Metroid release in over a decade. The announcement may have come as a surprise to many, but it\u2019s far from a new idea for series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to create a 2D Metroid for a while,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to create a 2D Metroid for a while.\u201d\nI had a chance to play through a 20-minute demo that represented the opening sequence of the game. Just like in the original Metroid II, Samus Returns opens with the titular bounty landing on the desolate planet SR388, and then exploring hostile caves home to angry aliens, including energy-sucking metroids. As in most Metroid games, you start pretty powerless; you need to seek out abilities like the morph ball and charge shot, which in turn help you open up new areas to explore. Samus Returns is a 2D game that features three-dimensional graphics, but the more detailed visuals don\u2019t slow down the pace at all. In fact, Samus Returns is a much tighter action experience compared to the now-ancient Metroid II. Samus can now aim in any direction, and chain together attacks; if you time it right you can bat away an enemy and then immediately blast it with a critical laser shot. It feels fast and fluid, with a sense of immediacy that fits well with the series.\nOutside of its tighter action and more detailed visuals, Samus Returns also includes a number of enhancements based around the 3DS hardware. For one thing, it\u2019s the rare game that actually makes great use of the handheld\u2019s glasses-free 3D effect, lending a sense of depth to the world. I found myself stopping to catch details in the background, like the corpses of unlucky cave explorers, and \u2014 unlike almost every other 3DS game I\u2019ve played \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to turn the 3D effect off. Meanwhile, the second screen is also put to use by displaying the in-game map at all times, making exploration a little easier. You can even place pins on the map, just like in Breath of the Wild, to remember areas you might want to explore later. (Sakamoto says he \u201cwasn\u2019t actually aware\u201d of that feature being in the latest Legend of Zelda game.)\n\nSakamoto served as the designer on the original Metroid, and he directed its successor, Super Metroid. But he didn\u2019t actually work on Metroid II. That said, he believes the portable game has an important place within the series \u2014 which is one of the main reasons he wanted to remake it. \u201cIn terms of Metroid II, that was a Game Boy game. It was quite a while back, and it hadn\u2019t been revisited,\u201d he explains. \u201cMetroid II I feel has a really important place in the Metroid franchise\u2019s history. It introduces us to baby metroid for the first time, and there are a lot of important elements in that title.\u201d While Sakamoto is helming the production, the game is actually being developed as a collaboration between Nintendo and Spanish studio Mercury Steam, whose best-known work is arguably the Castlevania reboot Lords of Shadow in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s this really nice meld of each company\u2019s experience and ideas, and the flavors that we bring to the series,\u201d Sakamoto says of the collaborative process between the two developers.\n\u201cWhat do we do to preserve some of that originality yet add to it?\u201d\nOf course, as with any reimagining, there\u2019s always the potential that any new features in Samus Returns could dilute the essence of the original experience. Metroid is known for its challenging gameplay and moody atmosphere, and with better aiming, faster action, and a more useful map, it\u2019s possible that some of that feeling will be lost in Samus Returns. It\u2019s a question the development team struggled with when they started working on the game two years ago. \u201cWhat do we do to preserve some of that originality yet add to it?\u201d asks Sakamoto. \u201cI think the key is that you\u2019re only adding things that improve upon that core concept. You\u2019re not changing things just to change things. It\u2019s really not that different from creating a game from scratch \u2014 you\u2019re just looking to build something fun and enjoyable.\u201d\nMetroid: Samus Returns is a game that fans have been asking for for quite some time. And for Sakamoto, announcing the title yesterday provided a profound sense of relief \u2014 it\u2019s both a game fans were clamoring for and a game he yearned to make. \u201cI\u2019ve had this sense of anticipation,\u201d he says of the E3 reveal. \u201cI wanted to talk about it, I wanted to tell people that we\u2019re doing this.\u201d\n"}
