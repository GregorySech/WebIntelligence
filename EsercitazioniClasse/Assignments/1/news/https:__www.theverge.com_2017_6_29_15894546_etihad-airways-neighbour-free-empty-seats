{"title": "Etihad Airways\u2019 new neighbor-free concept lets you bid for empty seats", "content": " \nEtihad Airways has introduced a new \u201cNeighbour-Free Seat\u201d concept, allowing passengers to bid on up to three extra empty seats adjacent to their booked seat. If the bid is won, the extra seats will remain vacant for the duration of the passenger\u2019s journey, meaning you could have an entire row all to yourself.\nAccording to Etihad\u2019s site, the bid can be placed when buying your seat. There is a minimum and maximum bid the site will accept per seat, and priority will be given to members of the airline\u2019s frequent flyer program, Etihad Guest. If you win the bid, you will be notified 32 hours before your flight departs.\nWhile bidding for empty seats can seem a little unnecessary, many of the Abu Dhabi-based airline\u2019s most popular routes \u2014 to destinations like Kuala Lumpur and London \u2014 are long-haul flights. For trips that can last nearly 14 hours (Abu Dhabi to Sydney, for example), extra space could be a huge difference. Having this room could be an attractive option for families with young children, those traveling for business, and really, anyone who likes sleeping across an entire row of plane seats.\nYou could have an entire row all to yourself\nUnfortunately, representatives for Etihad refused to disclose specific pricing regarding the minimum and maximum bids for Neighbour-Free Seats. Without this, it\u2019s impossible to say at face value if bidding on, say, three extra seats would actually be cheaper than buying a business or first class seat (which would then come with additional class perks for the price). A sample one-way flight we looked up on the Etihad site between Abu Dhabi and Sydney was $799.10 for economy and $3,094 for business class.\nIn theory Neighbour-Free Seats is a great idea, not just for an airline to make use of unsold seats, but for passengers who want additional space. However, not being transparent about pricing makes it hard for people to consider if it\u2019s worth buying into. \u201cTrust us, it\u2019s a good deal\u201d has never been a great tool to win people over. But, people might be willing to overlook it because empty seats don\u2019t talk or snore (or smell).\nYou can view additional details on how Etihad\u2019s Neighbour-Free Seat program works on its website.\n"}
