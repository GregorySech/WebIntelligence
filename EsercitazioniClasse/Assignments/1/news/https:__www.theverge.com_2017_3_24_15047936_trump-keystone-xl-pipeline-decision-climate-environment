{"title": "Trump has approved the Keystone XL pipeline, as promised", "content": " \nThe Trump administration has issued a permit to go ahead and build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The $8 billion project has been the subject of a years-long fight between environmental advocates and those who claim the pipeline will create much-needed new jobs. Today\u2019s decision overrules the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 decision to kill the project. \nWe knew the approval was coming, since President Donald Trump signed memoranda to resurrect the stalled pipeline back in January. Still, even with today\u2019s permit, the pipeline\u2019s exact route is controversial and the company running it, TransCanada, needs to get additional building permits in several states. \nKeystone XL is supposed to carry oil from Canada to the border between Nebraska and Kansas, and then connect to the the Gulf Coast Pipeline. Because it crosses the Canadian border, the project needs to be approved by the State Department. However, two years ago the State Department conducted a review and said the pipeline should not go ahead. (Current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was the CEO of Exxon Mobil, recused himself from today\u2019s decision after protesters said his background indicated a conflict of interest.) \nThis will only create 50 jobs\nEnvironmental groups argue that pipelines are not safe because leaks are common and contribute to massive environmental damage. The leaks they fear are not exactly hypothetical. In January, for example, a Canadian pipeline spilled 200,000 liters of oil in a First Nations community. And a ProPublica report says that only 7 percent of natural gas lines and 44 percent of so-called \u201chazardous liquid lines\u201d are regularly checked. \n\u201cThe Keystone XL pipeline is a disaster for people, wildlife and the planet,\u201d Kier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \u201cDonald Trump only cares about making his special interest pals richer even though our children will inherit a world ravaged by climate change. We will use every tool we have to fight this pipeline from the courts to the streets.\u201d\nOil advocates, on the other hand, say that the \u201cpipeline will create thousands of much-needed jobs for Americans\u201d and also boost the United States\u2019 energy security. But PolitiFact has rated these jobs numbers as false. The pipeline will only create about 50 jobs in the long run, though it could create as many as 42,100 temporary jobs during construction. And Trump\u2019s goal of \u201cenergy independence\u201d is actually dangerous for our national interests. One thing is for sure: this decision is consistent with Trump\u2019s incoherent plans for the environment. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
