{"title": "Here\u2019s the Deadpool 2 teaser playing before Logan", "content": " \nThere\u2019s no end credits scene playing at the end of Logan (which is fine by us), but there is a taste of Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Deadpool 2 playing before the film. The long teaser, titled No Good Deed, is an extended bit that takes no small amount of inspiration from another notable superhero franchise. \nReynolds shared the video this morning on Twitter, and it\u2019s a fun one. Hearing an altercation, Wade Wilson runs to change into his costume, finding a nearby telephone booth. He changes to the tune of John Williams\u2019 Superman films before leaping into action, only to discover that he\u2019s a bit too late to save the day. \nThere\u2019s plenty of visual gags in the background (not to mention a Stan Lee cameo), and the bit ends with a lengthy ramble. The teaser shows that at the very least, we can expect the same irreverent humor in the sequel film, whenever it comes. \n"}
