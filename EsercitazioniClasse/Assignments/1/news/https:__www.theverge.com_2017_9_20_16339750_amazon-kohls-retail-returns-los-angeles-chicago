According to Business Insider, there will be parking spots near store entrances designated for people coming to return Amazon goods.\nOnce you hand over a return, Kohl\u2019s will then package and transport the item to Amazon\u2019s return centers, free of charge. This is slightly easier than returning through USPS or UPS, as you won\u2019t need to tape up your own cardboard box. \nThe move is Kohl\u2019s allying itself with the e-commerce giant as analysts fear that Amazon will swallow up retail stores, especially after it made a successful transition into the groceries industry with the Whole Foods acquisition. Earlier this month, Kohl\u2019s also announced that it would sell the Amazon Echo and other devices at 10 of its stores in Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\n"}
