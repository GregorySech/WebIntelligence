{"title": "Moto G5 Plus review: a new value champion", "content": " \n\nIn the US, the G5 Plus comes in two configurations (the standard G5 is not being sold here): one is the $299 model I tested with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. The other cuts both of those numbers in half and sells for a cheaper $229. You\u2019ll be able to get them from Moto\u2019s website, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Costco, and other retailers. But here\u2019s the real hook: if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime user, you get a steep discount on either version \u2014 as long as you\u2019re willing to put up with lockscreen ads. The better 64GB / 4GB model drops to $239.99, and the lesser 32GB / 2GB G5 Plus falls all the way to $184.99. That\u2019s cheap.\n\nA smartphone that feels above its cost \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\nWhen I say that the Moto G5 Plus is a \"metal\" phone, that\u2019s only partially true. The backplate taking up much of the phone\u2019s rear is aluminum, but the G5\u2019s core frame is actually plastic. It\u2019s plenty sturdy, with tactile buttons, a creak-free frame, and an internal nanocoating that can save the phone from accidental spills. My issues with the design are twofold: for one, Lenovo made some aesthetic choices that make the phone look a little cheap, like the Moto logo plastered on the front and the shiny chrome edges that surround the display. Two, it\u2019s just a little bland. Your opinion may differ, and my unfavorable take might rest partly with the gold color I reviewed. And while the G5 Plus is comfortable to hold thanks to its 5.2-inch 1080p screen \u2014 not a size considered \"Plus\" by today\u2019s standards \u2014 it can feel a little slippery thanks to that metal backplate. It\u2019s not what I\u2019d call compact though, since the large top and bottom bezels negate the reasonably-sized display. On the left side is the volume toggle and a textured power button, and up top is the SIM tray, which also holds microSD cards to supplement the 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage.\nThe display is definitely one of the best things about the G5 Plus. It\u2019s a 1080p IPS LCD panel with flawless viewing angles. No matter how or from where you look at the screen, it\u2019s excellent. Just be aware that colors are somewhat muted compared to the vivid OLED displays on the Moto Z line \u2014 even in the \"vibrant\" display mode. Below the screen is a wide, oblong fingerprint reader. You can use it in one of two ways: by default, it\u2019s just like Moto\u2019s other fingerprint scanners that will unlock your phone or lock it again when you hold your finger down a bit longer. But there\u2019s also a neat trick that turns off Android\u2019s on-screen buttons (back, home, and recents) and lets you replicate them with swiping gestures.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\nYou swipe left to trigger Android\u2019s back function, or swipe right to enter multitasking view. You can even swipe right twice quickly to do Android Nougat\u2019s quick-switching action between apps. In this configuration, the fingerprint reader acts as a home button and can trigger Google Assistant. This do-everything fingerprint reader approach gives you just that extra little bit of space on the screen for emails, Facebook, and other content. The swiping gestures worked as expected most of the time, but as a longtime user of Android\u2019s on-screen buttons, I could never fully adjust to this style of using the phone day to day. I\u2019m probably just too hard-wired to the virtual buttons; people new to Android might prefer it.\n\nGreat software, but updates aren't guaranteed \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\nBut the biggest feature that Lenovo is emphasizing with the G5 Plus is the camera inside. It\u2019s a 12-megapixel f/1.7 sensor with larger individual pixels to pull in more light. On paper, that sounds fairly similar to the camera setup in Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. I wish I could say you were getting that phenomenal camera for half the price, but unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. In daylight, the G5 Plus captures impressive dynamic range (particularly in HDR mode) and keeps pace with cameras far above its price range.\nCome nighttime, the phone\u2019s lack of optical stabilization can have a noticeable, bad impact on your shots. Everything tends to look soft. Phone cameras don\u2019t need OIS to take fantastic low-light images (see: Google Pixel), but Moto\u2019s camera app and algorithms don\u2019t have the smarts to get the image you want on the first try. There\u2019s a pro mode that lets you adjust white balance, shutter speed, and ISO, but most people buying this phone are likely to tap and shoot. Compared to other phones in this price range, the G5\u2019s camera is ahead. It\u2019s just nowhere close to today\u2019s flagships, which is probably an unrealistic expectation to have.\nJust about everywhere else, the Moto G5 Plus excels at smartphone stuff. It\u2019s got Snapdragon\u2019s 625 processor inside, and as we saw previously on the Moto Z Play, 95 percent of the time it runs just as smooth and reliably as any $800 phone. And it\u2019ll outlast several of them between charges. The G5 Plus has a 3,000mAh battery, which has been enough to make the phone last for between 4 and 6 hours of screen-on time in my experience, and fast charging that can refuel the battery quickly. Two caveats: I\u2019ve had the phone for under a week, and have noticed an outlier or two where the battery drained faster than expected. It\u2019s not the all-time battery champion that the Z Play is, but it\u2019ll comfortably get you through a day of heavy use.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\nHopefully you\u2019ve still got some Micro USB cables around, because neither version of the G5 has USB Type C for charging. But a Micro USB port isn\u2019t the most glaring example of cost-cutting with this phone. That would be the total lack of NFC, which gives you a phone that can\u2019t do tap-to-pay with Android Pay or anything else you\u2019d use NFC for. That\u2019s inexplicably only true of the US version; international models will have NFC support. Lenovo\u2019s backwards justification for this is that US consumers have been slow to embrace mobile payments. You know what might help with that? Putting the technology in every phone regardless of price.\nFor many people, this phone can do everything they need\nFor software, out of the box you\u2019re getting Android 7.0 Nougat and Google Assistant. My review unit currently remains on a January security patch, which isn\u2019t the most encouraging thing to see. Motorola\u2019s got a rather patchy history with timely software releases \u2014 both on the software and security end of things.\nNougat-specific features, such as splitscreen multitasking, worked very well on the 64GB / 4GB model I tested, though I can\u2019t speak to whether it struggles on the cheaper $229 G5 Plus with 2GB of RAM. If you can afford it, I\u2019d absolutely go for the better hardware. That\u2019ll more comfortably last you another year or two. With the G5 Plus you\u2019re getting most of Moto\u2019s excellent software customizations like Moto Display lockscreen notifications and Moto Actions, letting you twist the phone to launch the camera or chop the phone twice to turn on the flashlight, among other gestures. The only one missing is Moto Voice. But that\u2019s not much of an issue since you can still set up \"OK Google\" to control the phone with your voice and get answers from Assistant.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\nThe Moto G5 Plus is simply an outstanding phone for the money. It\u2019s cheap, comes without monthly installments or commitments, and you can take it anywhere. Sure, spending $100 or $200 more will get you a better overall package in the OnePlus 3T, or the hard-to-believe battery longevity of the Moto Z Play. But not everyone can do that. And though the Moto G5 Plus is by no means the best smartphone available today, it\u2019s hard to find a better one at this price \u2014 especially if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime subscriber.\n \n"}
