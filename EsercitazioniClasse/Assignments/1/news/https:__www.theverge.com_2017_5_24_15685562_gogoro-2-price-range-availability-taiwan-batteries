{"title": "Gogoro\u2019s colorful new electric scooter is twice as cheap but just as fast as before", "content": " \nTaiwanese company Gogoro is rolling out an all-new electric scooter called the Gogoro 2 Smartscooter. But instead of the futuristic look that turned so many heads when the company came out of stealth at CES 2015, Gogoro is trying to put a modern spin on the classic scooter look with the Gogoro 2. \nThe company will start selling the new scooter this summer in Taiwan, and it says it will be available \u201cin other markets by the end of 2017.\u201d (Though it wouldn\u2019t say whether that means it will sell the Gogoro 2 in other markets or if that means the scooter will be added to the company\u2019s scooter sharing fleets in Berlin and Paris.) It will cost NT$38,800 ($1,295 USD) and comes in six colors \u2014 white, grey, orange, blue, yellow, and red. \nComing to \u201cother markets\u201d later this year\nWhat\u2019s wild about that price tag is that the Gogoro 2 matches its predecessor almost exactly on performance, thanks to a new and more efficient 6.4 kilowatt motor. It can go 0-50 km/hr in 4.3 seconds, has a top speed of 90 km/hr (about 55 miles per hour), and a 110km range (about 68 miles) \u2014 all nearly identical to the first Smartscooter\u2019s benchmarks. (Gogoro sells a more performance-minded version of the original called the Gogoro S.) \nIn addition, the company updated just about everything else on the scooter. It\u2019s launching with a revamped version of the scooter\u2019s mobile app, supports biometric security technology (including TouchID), has a full-color LED panel between the handlebars now, and comes with a brighter LED headlamp. It also has more storage and can accommodate a passenger this time around.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new Smartscooter is powered by the same swappable batteries that helped the company stand out in the first place. But while they\u2019re more slick and convenient than plug-in charging, it also might be what\u2019s holding Gogoro back from expanding into other countries (beyond just scooter sharing). Infrastructure is expensive, and requires a lot of cooperation from local governments. Plans to sell the scooters in Amsterdam, for instance, have been on hold since 2016. \nBut there is some hope \u2014 Gogoro says it plans to add 500 more battery stations to the network of 350 that already exists in Taiwan. If it can prove out a way to rapidly build battery infrastructure, maybe Gogoro can become a new source of electric transportation around the world. It\u2019s obviously already figured out the scooter part.\n\n"}
