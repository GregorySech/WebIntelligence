{"title": "Your busted Android phone is ruining your chances at a second date", "content": " \nTo a certain type of gadget user, an Android smartphone is a symbol of defiance. These users see Google\u2019s software \u2014 its customization options, hardware affordability, and no-frills design \u2014 as the perfect refutation of the sterile, mass-marketed appeal of Apple\u2019s iPhone. Your Tinder date, however, doesn\u2019t care about any of that, according to cold, raw data. In fact, your date is judging you, and so are their friends, family, and likely everyone sitting in and around your table at dinner and then later on at the bar. \niPhone owners are far more likely to hate on Android phones\nAccording to a study conducted by Match.com and Research Now, iPhone owners are about 21 times more likely to negatively judge a date who uses an Android phone. On the flip side, Android owners are only 15 times as likely to negatively judge a date for opting for iOS. \nWhat this says about iPhone users isn\u2019t really clear. Perhaps they\u2019re haughty, condescending elitists who see technology as a badge of social status, and an $800 cellphone as a way to lord that over others. Or maybe they just really have no idea why your text messages are green and not blue. This confusing deviation from the norm could really freak them out \u2014 or in the case of this writer, get you coyly made fun of until the overwhelming shame forces you to trade in your Nexus. (We\u2019ll leave the Google Pixel, an excellent and pricey Android smartphone, out of this debate.)\nEven worse in this situation is a cracked screen. The same study found that women are 86 percent more likely to negatively judge a date for having a broken smartphone screen. So if you\u2019re an Android-toting, cracked-screen-having dude that just loves living on the edge of gadget acceptability, maybe consider a dumb phone for when you want to go out. Those are hard to break, and also experiencing a bit of a comeback these days. \n\n"}
