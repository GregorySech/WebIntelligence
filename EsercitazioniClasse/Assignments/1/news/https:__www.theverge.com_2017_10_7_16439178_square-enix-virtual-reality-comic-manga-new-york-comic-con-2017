{"title": "Square Enix shows off its vision for the future of comics with virtual reality", "content": " \nAfter a demonstration of the Oculus Dev Kit 1 in 2013, game developer and comic publisher Square Enix started work on a research project dubbed \u201cProject Hikari.\u201d The project was an attempt to adapt comics into virtual reality, by not just making something that look like it was a comic come to life, but also to explore what a VR comic means. \nThe company is demoing the project, Tales of the Wedding Rings VR \u2014  based on a Japanese comic of the same name minus \u201cVR\u201d \u2014 on the Oculus Rift at New York Comic Con this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAYBE/Square Enix\n\n\nTales of the Wedding Rings VR is a non-interactive viewing experience in a virtual space. It\u2019s not so much a virtual reality comic, but a VR 3D animated film framed as a comic. They do this by using the visual language of comics and how it conveys a narrative as a way to effectively guide the viewer.\nSquare Enix predominantly use these floating comic-like panels that the team calls \u201clive panels.\u201d While shaped and used like panels in a comic book, they allow them to frame and place shots of the scene and characters without the viewer moving at all. But inside those panels, everything is still three dimensional. Effectively the completely 360 virtual environments are only used to establish the setting of a scene, while the scene itself is played out in live panels. \nFor example, the opening scene starts by placing the viewer in the backyard of the two story apartment building where the main characters, Sato and Hime, live. The viewer is given the opportunity to freely look around the backyard as if they were standing there, until a live panel appears showing Sato and Hime walking into the backyard. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAYBE/Square Enix\n\n\nThere is then a transition as a new live panel appears, showing them walking up the stairs and then another as they walk to their apartments. As Hime walks past Sato, the scene splits to show two panels: one to the right, where we see Hime from Sato\u2019s perspective as she turns around, and a panel on the left of Sato from Hime\u2019s point of view, which gives the viewer the option to look at either while they talk.\nThe dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese, but it\u2019s also accompanied by comic speech bubbles in English. While this helps to essentially subtitle the work for non-Japanese speakers, it\u2019s also used help draw the viewer\u2019s attention as you might use them in a traditional comic to transition the reader between comic panels.\nOther VR experiences that I\u2019ve seen that attempt to adapt comics either use the dimensionality of VR to place the user into what is basically a static panel from the comic with a voiceover, or they project the comic onto the environment with very limited animation as a sort of guided view through the panels with some sound effects and music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAYBE/Square Enix\n\n\nBut by using the visual language of comics, along with fully animated 3D characters and environments, the Tales of the Wedding Rings VR demo is a very good proof-of-concept for how to effectively convey a narrative to a viewer in a virtual space. \nWhile I\u2019ll be interested to see what Square Enix is able to do in the full version when it is released in 2018, (there is no mention of price or platforms yet), what I\u2019m actually looking forward to is someone not adapting an existing comic with these techniques, but creating an original story specifically using these techniques in a native VR environment.\n"}
