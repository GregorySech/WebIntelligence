And no, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s right next to the camera. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s not centered, making it awkward for left-handers to slide their index finger over without smudging the camera lens when holding the phone in their dominant hand.\nI\u2019ve become obsessed with my left-handedness ever since my father tried to switch me when I was in the first grade (admittedly a little late, but he succeeded in getting me to at least write with my right). In instances that didn\u2019t involve writing, however, I rebelled. When school teachers in Bangkok, where I grew up, would tell me to switch my utensil hand from left to right during our lunch periods, I\u2019d wait until they walked away to swap back. When I was bored in a college lecture, I\u2019d pass time by taking notes with my left hand. It took a little longer, but I wanted to reconnect the part of me that was born this way, but was forced to change without choice.\nBeing hyper-aware of living as a left-hander in a right-handed world, I pick up on design biases daily when reviewing gadgets for my job. I\u2019m mildly annoyed with Samsung and the S8 because the company has appears to be historically unfriendly to left-handers, with the stylus on the Note always stored on the bottom right side. This means I have to move my palm or switch hands back and forth each time I need to draw out the stylus. When the first Samsung Galaxy phone with a curved edge display came out, the company completely disregarded how left-handers could use the device.\n\n\nhow 2 use galaxy note edge with your left hand pic.twitter.com/FkwYuCmtxw\u2014 dan seifert (@dcseifert) September 3, 2014\n\n\n\nOther tech leaders could do better, too; on Android, switching to a Right-To-Left layout requires digging deep into developer mode, making it seem as if that option is simply not important enough to display upfront. And why is Apple adamant on not centering the digital crown on its smartwatches? Using the Apple Watch upside down isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, but it\u2019s one of the many things that suggest left-handed design is an afterthought for most tech companies.\nto tech companies, left-handed design is just an afterthought\nMaybe we\u2019re entering into whining territory here. I\u2019m not asking tech companies to make a left-handed version of every gadget out there just to appease the 10 percent of the population \u2014 about 700 million people \u2014 that may care. But it\u2019s the thoughtfulness that counts, and it\u2019s something I wish gadget makers and developers would consider more when designing an item meant to be used by everyone. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to see the option to set up your phone as a left- or right-hander a la Nintendo DS, or just centralizing important buttons to the middle of the device. Left-handers have spent their entire lives adjusting \u2014 for once, it would be nice to see that consideration recognized in return.\n"}
