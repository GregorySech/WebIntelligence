{"title": "Netflix will lampoon the true crime resurgence it helped fuel", "content": " \nNetflix\u2019s latest original series, American Vandal, is about a high school senior named Dylan Maxwell (Jimmy Tatro), who\u2019s in a bit of a pickle. \u201cThis is just not the way I thought things were going to go. I was going to graduate high school, get my degree in engineering,\u201d he says in the trailer\u2019s eerie voiceover. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d \nHe\u2019s been accused of vandalism, or more specifically of spray-painting a bunch of dicks on the cars in the school parking lot. Only the well-meaning teen journalist Peter Maldanaldo\u200b (Tyler Alvarez) can uncover the truth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Netflix\n\n\nThe series\u2019s trailer is structured beat-for-beat like a trailer for one of Netflix\u2019s wildly popular true crime projects, like 2015\u2019s Making a Murderer, 2016\u2019s Amanda Knox documentary, or this spring\u2019s The Keepers miniseries. Netflix has been one of the biggest participants in and drivers of a true crime renaissance, spurred by HBO\u2019s The Jinx and Serial, the viral podcast that will soon be a TV show on Fox. This January, Chris DeVille wrote about this type of series for The Verge, saying, \u201climited series present a formal sweet spot between a feature film and a traditional episodic show that makes them TV's closest equivalent to a paperback novel. So police work, a subject that lends itself to pulp fiction, has proven ideal for this format.\u201d The limited, true crime series is also the perfect Netflix format, as it\u2019s short and faux-urgent enough to burn through in a single day. \nnetflix built it, now it\u2019s gonna burn it\nBut maybe the moment is over. It\u2019s been less than four months since Netflix debuted a new documentary about the JonBen\u00e9t Ramsay case, but with American Vandal, the platform / production powerhouse now seems willing to mock the movement it\u2019s at least 40 percent responsible for. \nAmerican Vandal\u2019s straight-faced satirical trailer does borrow from Making a Murderer in one way that\u2019s a little uncomfortable. Playing off that series\u2019s assertion that Steven Avery was just too stupid to have committed a complicated murder, this trailer has one student testify of the alleged dick-drawer, \u201cThey say he deleted the security footage... there\u2019s just no way. He\u2019s the dumbest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d The true crime resurgence is ripe for comedy, but I\u2019m not sure why the butt of the joke would be the original subjects. \nThe series is a collaboration between Dan Perrault, who makes ScreenJunkies\u2019 Honest Trailers series, and Tony Yacenda, who is best known for his work on CollegeHumour Originals and rapper Lil Dicky\u2019s unbearable music video for the unbearable song \u201cPillow Talking.\u201d The show was produced by Funny or Die, 3Arts, and CBS\u2019s television division, and the first season launches on Netflix on September 15th. \n"}
