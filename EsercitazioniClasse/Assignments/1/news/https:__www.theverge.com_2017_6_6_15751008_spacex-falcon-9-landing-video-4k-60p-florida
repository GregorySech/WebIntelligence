{"title": "Watch SpaceX\u2019s most recent beachside rocket landing in 4K", "content": " \nSpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket for the 11th time ever this past weekend, and the company just released the first new footage of the feat. The short clip was shot in 4K resolution, and at 60 frames per second, so it offers a stellar view of the rocket landing right near the beach at Cape Canaveral. \nThe footage, apparently shot from a drone or nearby helicopter, shows the landing in great detail. You can even see the rocket kick up debris on the landing pad as it approaches the bullseye. And speaking of that, this landing was particularly on the money thanks to some clever thinking \u2014 SpaceX painted the target with \u201cradio reflective paint,\u201d which helped the rocket split the company\u2019s trademark \u201cX\u201d down the middle, according to CEO Elon Musk.\nThis was the fifth time the company landed a rocket on solid ground. Most of its landings have come at sea, where the Falcon 9 rockets have to settle down on an autonomous barge. While SpaceX is consistently able to stick those landings, the early attempts at landing in the ocean were marked with explosions thanks to the sheer number of variables at play. But the company has stuck every single attempt to land a rocket at Cape Canaveral, dating all the way back to December 2015, when it landed its first.\nWatch a GIF of every successful \u2014 and failed \u2014 SpaceX Falcon 9 landing attempt\n"}
