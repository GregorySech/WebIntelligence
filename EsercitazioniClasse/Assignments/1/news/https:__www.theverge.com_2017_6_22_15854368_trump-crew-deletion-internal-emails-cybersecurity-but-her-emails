{"title": "President Trump is being sued for deleting official emails because we have learned nothing", "content": " \nAfter what felt like years of hammering Hillary Clinton for failing to adhere to federal email transparency policies, you might think politicians would take pains not to make the same mistake. But now, the White House has been accused of just that.\nThis morning, the nonprofit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed suit against President Donald Trump for violations of three separate federal records laws, including the automatic deletion of internal emails. In each case, the effect of the violations would be to place internal communications outside the reach of public transparency measures like the Freedom of Information Act \u2014 exactly what politicians spent an entire campaign season arguing about.\nI honestly thought we were ready to stop talking about emails\nThe complaint offers no hard evidence that the president has violated retention laws, but there has been significant third-party reporting suggesting some communications may have been deleted. In March, MSNBC reported that Trump aides were \u201cwiping their electronic devices\u201d to destroy evidence that could be used against them in the Russia probe. Other reports alleged that early executive orders on immigration were drafted to leave as little record as possible. The practice of deleting presidential tweets has also come under fire, prompting a congressional inquiry earlier this year. \nThe complaint particularly cites self-destructing messaging applications as a violation of presidential responsibilities. \u201cFrom early on in this Administration,\u201d the complaint alleges, \u201cWhite House staff have used... certain email messaging applications that destroy the contents of messages as soon as they are read, without regard to whether the messages are presidential records.\u201d\nNone of this brings up the same cybersecurity issues as maintaining a private email server, but the core of it \u2014 going outside the system so people can\u2019t catch you doing anything embarrassing \u2014 is exactly the same. It\u2019s hard to say if the lawsuit will go anywhere. With both the health care repeal and Russia investigation plowing forward, it\u2019s unlikely to be anyone\u2019s top priority. Still, there\u2019s something unbelievable about the whole scenario. I honestly thought we were ready to stop talking about emails. But maybe we\u2019ll never be done. Maybe we\u2019ll just go on and on forever.\n"}
