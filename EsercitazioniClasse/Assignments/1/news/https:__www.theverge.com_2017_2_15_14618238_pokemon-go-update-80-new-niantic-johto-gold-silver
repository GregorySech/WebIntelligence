Today developer Niantic announced that 80 new pocket monsters are coming to the mobile game later this week. The new recruits will be culled from the Johto region from Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, and will include the likes of Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. Unlike previous additions like Pichu and Togepi, players will be able to encounter the new pok\u00e9mon in the wild, instead of just hatching them from eggs.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe update will cover more than new creatures to collect. Pok\u00e9mon Go will also be getting what developer Niantic describes as \u201cnew encounter gameplay,\u201d as well as two new types of berries \u2014 including one that slows down opponents \u2014 and additional outfit options to deck out trainers. There are also new evolution items that can be used to evolve the new additions to the game.\nThis is one of the biggest updates to the game since its debut last summer, and according to Niantic CEO John Hanke, there\u2019s more to come as well. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is a live experience which we\u2019ll be continuing to support and evolve in new and interesting ways for years to come with new gameplay features, in-game and live events, more pok\u00e9mon to discover, and much more,\u201d he said in a statement.\nOver the last few months the game has seen a number of new updates, including the addition of sponsored gyms and limited time in-game events. It also made its long-awaited debut on Apple Watch and launched in new markets like South Asia in December.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go Advanced Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
