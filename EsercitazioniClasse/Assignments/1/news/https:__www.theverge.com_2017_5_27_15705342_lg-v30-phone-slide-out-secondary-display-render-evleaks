{"title": "A render of LG\u2019s V30 phone reveals a slide-out secondary display", "content": " \nLG is reportedly planning to release its premium V30 smartphone in September, and it\u2019s thought that it\u2019ll have an OLED screen instead of an LCD one. According to notable leaker Evan Blass, the original concept for the phone could also feature a slide-out secondary display. \nBlass released a series of renders, cautioning that the images are older mock-ups, and it\u2019s not clear if the phone is actually going to feature the secondary display as imagined. The renders reveal a primary screen that could slide up to reveal a second one under it, which could be used for a keyboard, search results, or additional controls that might otherwise obstruct what you\u2019re looking at. \n\n\nWeekend bonus: this is an old-ish mockup of Project Joan, a.k.a. the LG V30. Not clear if the project is still headed in this direction.

It remains to be seen just what the final version of the phone will look like, and if it\u2019ll include the slide-out display. We\u2019ll find out later this fall. \n"}
