{"title": "Halt and Catch Fire is the perfect show about tech innovation", "content": " \nMost film and TV stories about innovation suggest that technological progress is the product of isolated, great men \u2014 almost exclusively men \u2014 working on fresh ideas, undeterred by the sweep of history or their peers\u2019 small-mindedness. Consider The Social Network, The Imitation Game, or any of the world\u2019s surplus of Steve Jobs biopics, which perfected this narrative. They all focus on misunderstood geniuses, asking, \u201cAre they alienated because they\u2019re brilliant, or brilliant because they\u2019re alienated?\u201d\nHalt and Catch Fire knows this is bullshit. The AMC series, which begins its fourth and final season on August 19th, is the best depiction of technological innovation on television, because it focuses on collaboration rather than constraint, problem-solving over vision, and people instead of potential Academy Award trophies. Halt and Catch Fire fleshes out its characters, and shows how their personalities supplement their work, instead of servicing it. \n\nThe show begins in 1983, with Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace) assembling a team to reverse-engineer a new PC from a proprietary IBM design. That team, and the rest of the show\u2019s main cast, consists of genius coder Cameron Howe, played by Mackenzie Davis (the internet\u2019s girlfriend in the Black Mirror episode \u201cSan Junipero\u201d) and married engineers Gordon (Scoot McNairy) and Donna Clark (Kerry Bish\u00e9).\nThe series focuses on collaboration rather than constraint, and problem-solving over vision\nHalt and Catch Fire\u2019s first season is rocky. It\u2019s heavily indebted to Mad Men, and it relies on Joe\u2019s \u201cmysterious\u201d charms as the sort of enigmatic, brilliant figure who would be the center of a more conventional tech biopic. But beginning with the second season, the show shifts its focus to the partnership between Donna and Cameron as they become the co-stewards of Mutiny, a gaming company that later expands into other early internet ventures, like Chat and eTail. It becomes about the way its characters work together, rather than \u2014 or in addition to \u2014 the ways they butt heads.\nJoe, admittedly, assumes a largely nefarious role throughout the series, and the Steve Jobs parallels are impossible to ignore. He wears a lot of sweaters, gives cryptic speeches to the press, and spends a lot of time posing for magazine covers. He\u2019s a face, but he\u2019s also a deconstruction of the myth of the misunderstood, erratic genius that surrounds Jobs and similar types. His primary benefit is to see where the world is going, and push the other characters in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: AMC\n\n\nCameron has a propensity for vision in line with Joe\u2019s, filtered through her confidence in her own ability to code and a steadfast conviction that her ideas are always the best ones. Her chaotic energy and anarchic tendencies let her harness the frat house energy of Mutiny\u2019s younger coders, who are prone to throwing fireworks around the office, squirting each other (and their equipment) with water pistols, and lighting up at all possible opportunities. She is stymied when it comes to translating her ideas into business success.\nEach of the character permutations has its own kind of energy\nIn turn, both Joe and Cameron are constrained by the Clarks\u2019 practical nature. Gordon is a pushover with the technical skill to actualize the vision of the Camerons and Joes of the world. Donna is a born executive capable of shepherding Mutiny into being a real company. Gordon and Donna are often pushed into being parental figures for the other characters: Gordon\u2019s the doofy dad who\u2019s wiser than he seems, while Donna\u2019s the tough mom holding her rowdy coding children to account. \nEach of the permutations has its own particular energy. Joe and Gordon are an effective team, during the rare moments when they\u2019re on the same page. Joe and Cameron\u2019s connection is like a creative rocket, until their partnership implodes. Gordon and Donna\u2019s practicality makes their relationship solid, until they start struggling. And Donna and Cameron\u2019s partnership is the most powerful of all, pushing through all of the problems that would normally hinder women starting a tech company in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: AMC\n\n\nWhen the fourth and final season begins in 1994, the cast is scattered to the winds: Cameron is working remotely from Tokyo, Joe is in isolation in a basement surrounded by Post-Its, and Gordon is running an internet company himself. Donna is now the villain, having made partner at a venture capital firm and chosen fancy juices and board meetings over grimy mainframes and hastily assembled wiring. But Halt and Catch Fire is never that simple. She has to deal with workplace sexism that would make her the uncomplicated hero of any other period piece.\nAs the series heads toward the finish line, the characters begin to aggressively ask, \u201cWhat projects are worth our time? Have we chosen well?\u201d Joe, Cameron, and Gordon are set to race against Donna\u2019s firm to, essentially, invent Google (or \u201cindex\u201d the web, as they put it), a project with nebulous practical applications in the moment. Joe and Gordon butt heads over the project, while Cameron is apathetic at best. Gordon makes an extended analogy to Thomas Edison in which he describes their safer, more utilitarian work as running a power company. \nTo its credit, Halt and Catch Fire refuses to take seriously the argument that \u201cnon-creatives\u201d exist solely to stifle the visionary inventors. When Cameron makes the game of her dreams, no one wants to play it \u2014 and the show suggests that it\u2019s fairly obtuse. Joe\u2019s manipulative tendencies are, if not necessary for his big-picture obsessions with new, open forms of communication, at least an unfortunate side effect. Donna\u2019s talent for micromanaging is extraordinarily useful when it comes to running a company and keeping Cameron on track, but it also accelerates the breakdown of her partnership with Cameron and her marriage to Gordon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: AMC\n\n\nThe cast of Halt and Catch Fire is truly formidable when they work together as a team, which only strengthens the show\u2019s unintentional, central dramatic irony: no matter how successful they are, the characters will never manage to accomplish anything truly innovative. Because the series is ostensibly set in the \u201creal\u201d world, the former Mutiny team is constantly circling around actually getting to be the people who come to the big conclusions, and make the big bucks. They will never accomplish their professional goals, at least not in the ways they expect.\nBut success on those terms isn\u2019t really the point, Halt and Catch Fire suggests. The show has always focused more on the process. Its visual style manages to charge meetings, coding sessions, or a group of people standing in front of a whiteboard with creative potential. The opening shot of the season premiere is quieter than True Detective\u2019s much-lauded tracking shot, but it manages to use sustained camera movement to follow not a physical space, but the passage of time. The team\u2019s warehouse office goes from an empty room full of pencils and coding books to a bustling hive of activity, even as Joe has clearly remained in stasis. \nRather than just doing one innovation-drama story \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs \u2014 Halt and Catch Fire has done all of them, and, most impressively, suggested that they aren\u2019t over. One focus of the season appears to be Donna and Gordon\u2019s children, now rowdy, rebellious teenagers capable of engaging in their own coding projects. Will they learn from their parents, whose greatest accomplishments come in moments of collaboration and openness to other perspectives? Handing down a point of view, rather than an idol \u2014 a work in progress, rather than an eternally finished project \u2014 might be a start.\n\n"}
