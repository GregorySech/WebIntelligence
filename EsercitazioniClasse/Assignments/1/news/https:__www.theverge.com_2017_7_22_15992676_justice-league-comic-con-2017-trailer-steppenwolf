{"title": "The Comic-Con trailer for Justice League reveals their true enemy", "content": " \nWarner Bros.\u2019s Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con is pulling out all the stops for the DC Extended Universe. For the latest trailer for Justice League, the world is still in mourning after the death of Superman. Now, it\u2019s up to the newly formed League to face Steppenwolf (Game of Thrones alum Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) and his armies of Parademons.\nWhere\u2019s a Kryptonian when you need him?\nJustice League is the superhero team-up Warner Bros. has been promising since the inception of the DCEU. After Superman (Henry Cavill) sacrificed himself in the fight against Doomsday in last year\u2019s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Batman (Ben Affleck) takes it upon himself to find other superheroes to fight otherworldly threats. That means teaming up with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). There\u2019s even a mention of both Kryptonians and the Green Lantern Corp, even though they\u2019re nowhere in sight. Clearly, the heroes have their work cut out for them.\nWarner Bros. celebrating Justice League comes after Wonder Woman\u2019s outsized success at the box office. This trailer also makes the movie look like a whole lot of fun, with plenty of action and humor (especially from Alfred (Jeremy Irons) and The Flash). But that doesn\u2019t mean the film will necessarily be another feather in the studio\u2019s cap. There\u2019s still skepticism as to whether or not it will be a Avengers-style landmark and if it will be yet another black mark on Warner\u2019s slate. At least there\u2019s enough here to keep fans more than invested.\nJustice League will hit theaters on November 17th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
