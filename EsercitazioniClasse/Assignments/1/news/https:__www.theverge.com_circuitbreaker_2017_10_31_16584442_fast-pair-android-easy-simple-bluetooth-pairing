{"title": "Fast Pair is Android's answer to Apple's effortless AirPods pairing", "content": " \nApple users are quickly growing accustomed to effortless wireless pairing between the iPhone (or Mac computers) and AirPods, but Google has been working on something that should remove at least some frustration from connecting Bluetooth gadgets to Android phones. Some speakers and headphones let you speed up the pairing process with NFC, which is pretty convenient, but now devices running Android 6.0 and above will get yet another, even better option: Fast Pair. \nThis new approach uses Bluetooth Low Energy and your Android phone\u2019s location to automatically discover Bluetooth accessories in close proximity and then automatically connect with a tap. It even shows a picture of the product you\u2019re using. Sound familiar? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got a Fast Pair-enabled device nearby (and there are less than a handful of them to start), your Android smartphone will fetch the device's product image, product name, and companion app \u2014 if one exists \u2014 from Google\u2019s servers. Once you hit connect, you should see a confirmation when pairing is successful. Then, Android will offer to download the accessory\u2019s companion app. (Noise-cancelling headphones often have apps to configure , as do some speakers.) \nThe actual pairing process still uses \u201cclassic Bluetooth,\u201d so Google isn\u2019t making any claims about improved connection reliability. But Bluetooth 5 should help in that regard as more phones and headphones, speakers, etc. are released with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is definitely the way things should be \u2014 especially as more and more Android phones lose the headphone jack. Bravo, Google. And it\u2019s great to see that support extends back to Android Marshmallow. But for Fast Pair to become a widespread Android convenience, accessory makers will need to adopt the feature. It\u2019s not a thing that will just work immediately for all of your existing Bluetooth gadgets. To do that, they can register with Google here. \nSupported headphones at launch include Google\u2019s Pixel Buds, Libratone's Q Adapt On-Ear, and Plantronics Voyager 8200-series wireless headsets. The only thing users need to do is have the latest version of Google Play Services (11.7) installed, which is rolling out over the coming days and weeks. \n"}
