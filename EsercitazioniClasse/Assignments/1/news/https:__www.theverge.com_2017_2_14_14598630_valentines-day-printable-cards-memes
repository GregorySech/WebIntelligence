{"title": "This Valentine\u2019s Day, give your love in memes", "content": " \nToday is Valentine\u2019s Day. \nThis is our annual opportunity to bungle the things we say and fail to make clear the ways we feel. Love is ugly, strange, and inarticulable. It is not nice or fair, but it is the main thing anyone cares about, and it\u2019s good to have a holiday where we say that out loud as a group. But what is the best way to do it?\nEvery year, we\u2019re stuck with the same handful of options for expressing our most embarrassing inner monologues about the people in our lives. Those choices, as dictated by the forces of capitalism, are chocolate, flowers, Hallmark cards, songs written and performed by Phil Collins, framed photographs of key life moments, songs written and performed by Sting, or tickets to a romantic comedy starring a TV personality and a former action hero. \nlove isn\u2019t fair or nice, but today is the day!\nFor a lot of people (including me, I am very suggestible!) these options are fine. But for some members of our generation, raised to eschew sincerity at every turn and converse solely through the prism of memes, none of these gifts are acceptable. These youths (and former youths) need something else, or they are not going to get anywhere with this whole \u201cfinding someone to hold hands with while Nero plays the fiddle\u201d thing.\nTo that end, The Verge\u2019s premiere cartoonist Dami Lee has created a series of printable, shareable, romantic memes. \nWe\u2019ve done our best to make them say what\u2019s in your heart. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Dami Lee\n\n\n\n"}
