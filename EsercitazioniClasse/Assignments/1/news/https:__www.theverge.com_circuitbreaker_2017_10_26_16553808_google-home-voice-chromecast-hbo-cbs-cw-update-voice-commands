{"title": "You can now use Google Home voice commands to watch HBO, CBS, and The CW on a Chromecast", "content": " \nGoogle has added three new services that support Google Home voice commands with Chromecast devices: HBO Now, CBS All Access, and The CW. \nFor HBO and CBS, you\u2019ll need to first link those respective accounts in the Google Home app (The CW is free, so that should just work), after which you\u2019ll be able to simply ask Google Home to control playback. Google\u2019s smart assistant will even recognize specific shows on those networks, so you\u2019ll be able to directly ask it to play, say, Riverdale or Star Trek: Discovery. \nThe three new networks join the already supported list of YouTube, YouTube TV, Google Photos, and Netflix, which already work with Google Home and Chromecast for voice commands. The update should be available today.  \n"}
