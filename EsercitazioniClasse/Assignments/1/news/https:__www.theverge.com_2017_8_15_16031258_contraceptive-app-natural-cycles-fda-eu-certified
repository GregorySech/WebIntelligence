{"title": "This app is certified in the EU as a form of birth control. Is the US next?", "content": " \nSmartphone app Natural Cycles, the first app certified as a form of contraception in Europe, is setting its sights on the US next. \nThough plenty of cycle-tracking apps exist, most of them don\u2019t get the fertility window right. Natural Cycles uses a specially developed algorithm and other factors, including temperature, to determine which days a woman might be fertile. The certification is a \u201chuge milestone,\u201d says Natural Cycles co-founder Raoul Scherwitzl in an email. \nThe mobile health space is growing: about half of the 3.4 billion smartphone and tablet users will have downloaded mobile health apps by 2018, according to some estimates. And there\u2019s no shortage of apps: there were 165,000 health apps available in 2015, according to reports. That number has almost certainly grown since, but very few health apps have been approved for medical purposes by the FDA; FDA approval requires clinical evidence and that\u2019s expensive. New drugs cost about $1 billion to develop, but apps qualify as devices, so approval for them is cheaper at just $31 million to $350 million.\n3.4 billion people are predicted to use mobile health apps by 2018\nThe European inspection and certification company T\u00fcv S\u00fcd gave Natural Cycles a CE certification in February, which means the app is now considered a medical device for contraception in Europe. To get the CE certification, Scherwitzl says the app has repeatedly demonstrated in a series of clinical studies that it improves the effectiveness of traditional planning methods. Notified bodies are companies like T\u00fcv, which certify high-risk medical devices, whereas the European Medicines Agency gives certification for pharmaceuticals. EU member states pick the notified bodies, which are organizations that assess whether medical devices meet requirements set out in legislation. Scherwitzl says Natural Cycles followed the same approval path as the Durex Condom.\n\u201cAt the core of any regulatory certification is strong, clinical evidence that the product works as intended,\u201d Scherwitzl says. \u201cOur ambition is to have Natural Cycles certified in every country of the world.\u201d He and his wife, particle physicist Elina Berglund \u2014 part of the Nobel Prize-winning team that discovered the Higgs boson \u2014 founded the company together. Though she\u2019d used a hormonal implant as birth control for years, they wanted to switch to the rhythm method to avoid pregnancy, just in case Berglund did want to get pregnant later.  \nAs for plans for US approval, Scherwitzl says the process is similar to the one in Europe. \u201cYou submit your dossier, including all your clinical data, to the FDA and they review it and approve it if it meets their standards,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders Elina Berglund and Raoul Scherwitzl.\nPhoto: Natural Cycles\n\n\nThe app works like this: each morning, users measure their temperature, logging it into the app. Natural Cycles then uses an algorithm to calculate if the day is green, meaning not fertile, or red, when fertility is likely and using protection is recommended. The Swedish-based company charges \u00a339.99 ($52) for a yearly plan, which includes a thermometer, or \u00a35.99 ($7.80) per month. The company says its clinical studies have shown that the app is effective for contraception, \u201ccomparable to the contraceptive pill,\u201d and it has over 300,000 users in 161 countries. \nThere are obvious limitations, namely that the app doesn\u2019t prevent STDs. And it doesn\u2019t stop users from having unprotected sex during their fertile period, either. In fact, about half the women in a study of Natural Cycles got pregnant because they had unprotected sex while the app said they were fertile. A condom could have prevented that.\nIf apps like Natural Cycles are to be regulated, they would require evidence from rigorous study, says Victoria Jennings, director of the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University, in an email. \nThe FDA has yet to approve a fertility app\n\u201cThe published research (to date) does not meet contraceptive efficacy standards,\u201d Jennings says. \u201cIt may well be that such a study has been done, but it is not available in the published literature.\u201d\nThe studies involved women who were using the app without \u201cany interactions with health care professionals,\u201d says Scherwitzl. He claims the entire pharmaceutical industry is headed toward this model, \u201cbecause regulators demand it.\u201d \nReal-world data \u2014 which is collected from sources away from normal clinical trials \u2014 can \u201cprovide powerful insight into the benefits and risks of medical devices, including how they are used by health care providers and patients,\u201d says Deborah Kotz, an FDA spokeswoman, in an email. The FDA is \u201cworking to implement\u201d a national evaluation system for health technologies to make sure that data is high quality and reliable. \n\u201cIf a fertility app meets the definition of a medical device and is intended to aid in becoming pregnant or preventing pregnancy, then it would be subject to FDA premarket review,\u201d Kotz says.\nShe noted that the FDA has not yet cleared, granted, or approved any fertility apps for marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Natural Cycles\n\n\nNatural Cycles\u2019 certification in the UK is a \u201cbig step in the right direction,\u201d Jennings says. It means that users can be sure that the app and the accompanying thermometer work well, she says. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is its efficacy if it is studied under rigorous research,\u201d Jennings says. \u201cI hope that will be forthcoming.\u201d\n\n\n"}
