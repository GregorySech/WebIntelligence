{"title": "Thor: Ragnarok\u2019s extravagant costuming recaptures the joy of '80s superheroes", "content": " \nDirector Taika Waititi has promised a bright and \u201cout there\u201d take on the Thor mythology with his next feature, Thor: Ragnarok. Thanks to Entertainment Weekly, we have our first look at the actors in their roles. Waititi appears to be delivering on his promise. The film already looks like an homage to the weird worlds of Buckaroo Banzai, Flash Gordon, and other classic examples of \u201880s sci-fi.\nWaititi has said Ragnarok will strike a more comedic tone than previous entries in the Thor franchise. It\u2019s tough to tell without footage, but the wild photos suggest the characters will be having way more fun than anyone had in the comparatively drab Captain America: Civil War or the appropriately titled Thor: The Dark World. I mean, just look at Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s Cate Blanchett as Hela, the Asgardian goddess of death, looking like she\u2019s ready to join a The Cure cover band and eat someone\u2019s face live on stage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, hanging out with a few extras from Kamen Rider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very least, Ragnarok appears to be more visually striking and, dare I say it, fun than just about any other Marvel movie before it. Maybe the costuming and make-up will win the film an Oscar. I mean, Suicide Squad won one. Stranger things have happened.\n"}
