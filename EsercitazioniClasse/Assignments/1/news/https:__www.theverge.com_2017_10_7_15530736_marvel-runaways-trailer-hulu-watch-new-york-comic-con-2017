{"title": "Watch the first trailer for Hulu\u2019s Marvel\u2019s Runaways", "content": " \nAt New York City Comic Con yesterday, Hulu unveiled the first trailer for its upcoming Marvel Universe show, Runaways, as well as a release date: November 21st, 2017. \nThe show is based off of the 2003 Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona comic book series The Runaways, and this trailer introduces us to six teenagers who discover that their parent are members of The Pride, group of supervillains. After witnessing some sort of ritual, they\u2019re shocked at what they see, and begin to work out what their next steps are, while they contend with superpowers of their own. \nHulu announced that it would adapt the show in August 2016, and ordered the show to a series in May. It joins other Marvel television properties such as Cloak & Dagger (on Freeform), ABC\u2019s Agents of SHIELD, and the entire array of Defenders shows on Netflix. Like Cloak & Dagger, this show definitely looks like it\u2019s angling in on the young adult story, which isn\u2019t a surprise, given that it\u2019s been created by OC creator Josh Schwartz and Gossip Girl co-creator Stephanie Savage.\n \n"}
