{"title": "ZTE\u2019s rumored dual-screen folding smartphone seems to be real", "content": " \nZTE is apparently working on a new flagship smartphone called the Axon M, with the unique headline feature of dual screens that can unfold into a combined 6.8-inch display, according to Android Authority. \nThe new phone was rumored early in September by Evan Blass over at VentureBeat, who provided the additional details that the new device would feature a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 3,120mAh battery, and a single 20-megapixel camera. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Android Authority\n\n\nBut the biggest feature is still the form factor: two 1080p displays that make up the front and back of the device, which can unfold with a centrally located hinge to create one tablet-sized screen that\u2019s twice as wide. According to Android Authority, the two screens will also be able to run two different apps at once, for expanded multitasking beyond what\u2019s currently capable even in Android Oreo. \nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the Axon M isn\u2019t the first Android smartphone to try to make the dual-screen concept work in this form factor. That honor goes to the ill-fated Kyocera Echo, a Sprint-exclusive device from 2011 that tried and failed to make the concept work, due to a host of technical issues that held back the concept. But maybe with the benefit of time and more powerful hardware, ZTE can get it right. And at the very least, it\u2019s certainly something different than the slew of similar-looking flagship phones that we\u2019ve seen this year.   \n"}
