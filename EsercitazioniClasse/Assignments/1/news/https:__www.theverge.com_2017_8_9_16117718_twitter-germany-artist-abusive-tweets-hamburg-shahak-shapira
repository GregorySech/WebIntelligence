{"title": "Artist spray-paints abusive tweets in front of Twitter\u2019s German office", "content": " \nA German-Israeli satirist has painted abusive tweets in front of Twitter\u2019s office in Hamburg in an effort to draw attention to what he says is the company\u2019s failure in combating hate speech. The BBC reports that Shahak Shapira reported 300 incidents of abuse over six months, but Twitter responded to just nine, claiming those instances did not violate the social-network\u2019s terms of use. \n\u201cThe statements I reported weren\u2019t just plain insults or jokes, but absolutely serious threats of violence, homophobia, xenophobia, or Holocaust denial,\u201d Shapira says, in a YouTube video. Shapira, who is Jewish, said he also reported 150 comments to Facebook, and 80 percent of those were removed within a few days.\n30 tweets have been painted outside Twitter\u2019s office in Germany\nIn the video Shapira can be seen stenciling tweets with chalk paint in front of Twitter\u2019s German office. He chose 30 tweets in total, creating stencils from them, and traveled to Hamburg for the project. The tweets include \u201cRetweet if you hate Muslims,\u201d and other offensive material. \u201cIf Twitter forces me to see those things, then they\u2019ll have to see them too,\u201d says Shapira.\nTwitter has been struggling to tackle a bullying and abuse culture it is trying desperately to diminish. The company noted last month in a shareholder letter that there\u2019s been a 25 percent reduction in reports of abuse at the same time the number of abusive accounts it takes action on has increased by tenfold.\n\n\n"}
