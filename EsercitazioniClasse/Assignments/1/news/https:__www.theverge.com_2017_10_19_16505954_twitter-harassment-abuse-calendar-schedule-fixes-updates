{"title": "Twitter releases its calendar of upcoming measures to combat harassment and abuse", "content": " \nTwitter this afternoon publicly posted its schedule for instituting fixes and changes to longstanding abuse and harassment issues that have plagued the social network for years. The calendar, first disclosed earlier this week in an internal Twitter email obtained by Wired, details nearly two dozen changes stretching from October 27th to January 10th. They focus on a broad range of topics, from non-consensual nudity to hateful imagery and violent rhetoric to more transparency around account suspensions. \nSome measures include more proactively banning content on the platform that glorifies or condones violence, instead of simply drawing the line at actual threats of violence. The company will also suspend accounts of organizations that promote violence. Twitter says that on October 27th, its first change will involve expanding its definition of \u201cnon-consensual nudity\u201d to include \u201ccreep shots\u201d and hidden camera footage. It will also immediately suspend accounts that post this material, choosing to \u201cerror on the side of protecting victims and removing this type of content when we become aware of it,\u201d as the company detailed in its initial leaked email published by Wired. Twitter is also cracking down on abusive display names. \nTwitter is cracking down on hateful and violent rhetoric and trying to be more transparent and responsive\nTwitter says it wants to be more transparent with account suspensions too, especially following the controversy generated when it suspended actress Rose McGowan last week for what the public assumed was speaking out about sexual abuse at the hands of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. Twitter revealed later on that it was because McGowan had violated an arcane rule around the posting of personal contact information; one of her tweets included a phone number. Twitter\u2019s dedicated support team had to issue a series of tweets clarifying the situation, and it was yet another, albeit more high profile, example of how Twitter uses tone-deaf messaging to inconsistently enforce an already-opaque rule set. The company says it plans to respond to reports faster, provide more reasoning behind its rule enforcement, and provide more detailed information about account suspensions in the appeals process. \n\u201cThis won\u2019t be a quick or easy fix, but we\u2019re committed to getting it right. Far too often in the past we\u2019ve said we\u2019d do better and promised transparency but have fallen short in our efforts,\u201d the company writes in a statement. \u201cStarting today, you can expect regular, real-time updates about our progress. Sometimes, this may be insight into the difficult questions we\u2019re asking ourselves, even before we have the answers. This is the first time we\u2019ve shared this level of visibility into our work, and we hope it helps build trust along the way.\u201d\n\n\nWe just decided to share our internal safety work streams & shipping calendar tomorrow (10/19). This makes us feel uncomfortable because it\u2019s a work in progress & rough, but it\u2019s the right thing to do: we believe showing our thinking and work in real-time will help build trust.\u2014 jack (@jack) October 18, 2017\n\n\n\nTwitter has come under intense scrutiny this past year, more so than any time in its more than decade-long history, for its continuous technical, structural, and cultural failures with regards to addressing harassment and abuse on its platform. Starting in the lead up to the US election, and made only worse by the rise of the alt-right and other fringe political movements before and during President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure, Twitter has become a hotbed for vile speech, threats, and the proliferation of racism, sexism, and regressive behaviors. \nTwitter has failed to address these issues time and again, seemingly taking measures only when its back was against the wall. CEO Jack Dorsey said as much in a series of tweets on October 13th. \u201cWe prioritized this [harassment] in 2016. We updated our policies and increased the size of our teams. It wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them. New rules around: unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence.\u201d \n"}
