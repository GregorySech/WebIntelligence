{"title": "Over 10 years, Martha Stewart has quietly become the perfect blogger", "content": " \nThis summer marks 10 years since Martha Stewart started her lifestyle blog, The Martha Blog: The Official Martha Stewart Blog. It\u2019s about Martha\u2019s life, her family, her friends, her peafowl, and her desire to organize the 500 bottles of wine in her cellar. It\u2019s also about Martha\u2019s skills: at cooking, decorating, gardening, hosting, organizing, tweeting, crafting, farming, and caring for peafowl. Oh, and the act of blogging itself \u2014 arguably the dominant expertise of a woman who is supernaturally gifted at everything.\nThe style and layout of the blog has hardly changed at all over the course of a decade. Some image links are broken, and at some point Martha added a header subtly renaming the blog martha up close & personal. Widgets linking to Martha\u2019s Twitter account (started in 2009) and Pinterest (2012) are also newer, but otherwise the site is basically the same. It\u2019s a rudimentary website, with little in the way of adornment or interactive elements. Just black text, a white background, a comments section, and searchable archives. \nThe community of commenters who thank Martha for her advice and compliment her on her taste and apologize for the death of her cat named Bartok looks to be much of the same group throughout the years. The structure of each post is exactly the same because The Martha Blog is, duh, a blog. A near-daily blog to which Martha (or one of two assistants who help her in \u201cthe blog studio\u201d) will upload a series of photos and then describe what is happening in the photos as quickly and coherently as possible. For years, she has introduced these posts with \u201cEnjoy!\u201d or \u201cEnjoy the photos:\u201d or \u201cEnjoy these photos...\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: The Martha Blog\n\n\nYou would think, in 10 years, that someone might come along to do what Martha does and do it better. Many \u2014 hundreds \u2014 have tried, and all have failed. Even those who have come the closest can\u2019t match the authenticity of a Martha Stewart piece of advice, given their websites\u2019 immaculate, commissioned layouts and roster of contributors. Lauren Conrad, the former Hills star whose party-hosting books, crafting tutorials, and online market for handmade goods make her the closest we have to a Martha Stewart successor, is listed as the editor-in-chief of her own blog and writes only a slim percentage of the posts herself. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just not the same. She\u2019s conceded that she isn\u2019t, not really, a lifestyle blogger.  \nthe lifestyle blog industrial complex is inspired by martha, but can\u2019t touch her\nToday the lifestyle blog industrial complex is mostly associated with the weird, ongoing feud between Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson, or the sort of person who was briefly famous enough to achieve name recognition and figured they might as well do the cheapest thing you can do to stay spotlight-adjacent. That includes former Bachelor contestants, current fixtures on Bravo reality shows, the rest of the Kardashians, and basically everyone in Conrad\u2019s social circle. The content varies, but the aesthetic and the general message doesn\u2019t. They all put forth a pastel, soft-lit version of the world. The picture-perfect life revolves around an unimpeachable, usually white, body. \nWhere the modern lifestyle blog is about making the life you want look effortless, Martha has never protected her readers from the truth: if you want to have a magazine-worthy garden party, you will spend at least one hour staring down and wrestling with the intimidating metal apparatus of a party tent, and you will need help. Before you serve an elaborate lunch, you will have to measure your table to make sure all the plates fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: The Martha Blog\n\n\nAnything Martha does is accompanied by a roughly 53-image photo series, complete with captions about the intricacies, difficulties, and labor time. She has dozens of personal employees who work in her home, on her farm, and for the various arms of her company, and it\u2019s a given that they\u2019re doing some of the real muscle work \u2014 except Martha doesn\u2019t consider it a given, because whenever someone else is helping her, she takes their photo and explains what they contributed to a project. When Martha starts a process she anticipates will take a long time, she bravely labels the post \u201cPart 1.\u201d You can read all 10 years of Martha\u2019s archives, and you\u2019ll never find a \u201cPart 1\u201d that doesn\u2019t have a corresponding \u201cPart 2,\u201d or sometimes even a \u201cPart 3.\u201d Martha doesn\u2019t forget. Martha doesn\u2019t assume it will go unnoticed if she doesn\u2019t follow through. She gets around to it.\nMartha Stewart knows how to embrace the mundanity of being alive and of blogging. (She doesn\u2019t have a personal public Snapchat. I wish she did; we would all learn so much.) For Martha, any moment is just as worth documenting as any other. And it\u2019s true: who is she to decide which of the thousands of competent things she does every day will be useful and compelling to someone else? It\u2019s likely that they all are, equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: The Martha Blog\n\n\nThe best posts on The Martha Blog are anodyne and workaday in a way that implies a life without worry. They have headlines like \u201cStarting Onions from Seed,\u201d \u201cFrancesca Gets Acupuncture,\u201d or \u201cA Business Dinner at My Farm.\u201d For Martha, clickbait is a headline reading \u201cWhat are Desiree, German Butterball, Kerr's Pink, and La Ratte?\u201d (The answer? \u201cPotatoes!!!!\u201d) While the lifestyle blogs that have sprung up in her wake are more delicate illusions \u2014 designed to appear sincere and breezy, all the while concerned with metrics and online store referrals \u2014 Martha seems to blog for no other reason than because she likes it. It would be hard to milk a capitalist angle out of a post called \u201cSoaking and Planting the Peas.\u201d\nFor Martha, it\u2019s barely bragging to post a photo of Richard Gere, fork en route to his mouth at her 2015 holiday party, with the caption \u201cRichard Gere was crazy about the stuffed potatoes.\u201d The photo isn\u2019t even deemed interesting enough to appear near the front of the album. It comes after 45 photos of the food, flatware, and Martha\u2019s non-famous family members because Richard Gere is not the point. Martha\u2019s life is the point. \nmartha doesn\u2019t need to blog, she wants to\nIf we\u2019re being honest, whose ideal lifestyle (or at least one of their occasional daydreams) isn\u2019t seclusion on a sprawling, elegant estate with all the friends, family, pets, plants, Riesling, and linens one could ever want? \nMartha isn\u2019t stuck in the past. She loves Facebook Live (see this \u201cFBL\u201d art she made out of blueberries), and she has one of the wittiest and strangest Twitter accounts you\u2019re likely to find. But she realizes and respects the long-forgotten secret about blogging \u2014 that blogs are as much about the act as they are about the content, and that consistency and longevity are the only qualities in blogging worth respecting. Anyone can write about the first peacock they buy. Only a world-class blogger will write about every peacock they purchase and every thing that happens to each one. Anyone can share a personal story in hopes of aiding someone with a menial task. Only a truly exceptional blogger will do that every day for over 3,000 days and show no signs of stopping. Martha, possibly, has done her research and knows that blogging consistently is good for you. In any case, she made the promise of being there, and she has followed up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: The Martha Blog\n\n\nIncreasingly, celebrity bloggers have added paywalls to their best content \u2014 why not? There is now such a glut of fashion and home-making and trendy baking blogs from C-list celebrities and Instagram influencers that A-listers might as well put a premium on their higher production-value content. Both because they can, and to remind everyone that it\u2019s more valuable. To get the best of Kristin Cavallari or Kim Kardashian, you have to pay a modest recurring fee. To get the best of Martha, you still pay nothing. (Unless, of course, her free blog leads you to her monthly magazine.)\nShe rarely does sponsored content. Recently, tucked among the personal missives, there was a short post endorsing PetSmart dog beds. It\u2019s not as if you were going to go somewhere other than PetSmart (or maybe Target?) if you needed a dog bed anyway. It\u2019s like if someone asked me to do sponsored content for Morton Salt. Everyone would read my laudatory blog post and be like \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to pick Morton\u2019s just because Kaitlyn is telling me to, but it would be a weird amount of work to think of something different to buy.\u201d\nTo get the best of Martha, you still pay nothing\nIf you\u2019re going to indulge in materialism, Martha\u2019s is the materialism to indulge in. Her favorite things are usually made of paper, which is recyclable. Her other favorite things occur naturally, from the earth. For example, blueberries or baby chickens. Some of her belongings are clearly expensive \u2014 most glaringly, her house. Some of her product lines are expensive, too \u2014 most glaringly in my life experience, her scrapbooking supply line, which includes 1.5-ounce bottles of glitter that retail for $10.99 apiece. But on The Martha Blog, she\u2019s not selling you any of that, and she doesn\u2019t so much as hint that you ought to have a sweater as nice as hers before you can enjoy a crisp fall day. You should have an apple, in her opinion.\nMaybe you and I want different things from a lifestyle blog, and that\u2019s fine. You can feel anything, and I can feel this: Martha Stewart is the original lifestyle blogger, and no one will ever top her.\n\n"}
