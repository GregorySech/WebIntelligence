According to Variety, the award is being presented \u201cin recognition of a visionary and powerful experience in storytelling,\u201d making Carne y Arena the first project to merit such an honor since Pixar\u2019s Toy Story in 1996.\nAMPAS president John Bailey says that Carne y Arena \u201copened for us new doors of cinematic perception,\u201d and that \u201cmore than even a creative breakthrough in the still emerging form of virtual reality, it viscerally connects us to the hot-button political and social realities of the US-Mexico border.\u201d The short piece premiered at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, and it\u2019s currently being showcased at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\nCarne y Arena combines a virtual reality landscape with a physical environment, scattered with sand and articles of clothing left behind by people who attempted to cross the US-Mexico border. It places participants amid a group of immigrants as they\u2019re set upon by the US Border Patrol, emphasizing feelings of disorientation, uncertainty, and fear, before ending with a video installation where undocumented immigrants tell their stories.  In I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s own words, it\u2019s supposed to \u201callow the visitor to go through a direct experience walking in the immigrants\u2019 feet, under their skin, and into their hearts.\u201d\n"}
