James Damore filed the complaint against Google on August 7th, and the case page on the National Labor Relations Board website states that law firm Paul Hastings will represent Google. Damore\u2019s name isn\u2019t listed, but it has been confirmed by Business Insider. The only details available so far about the complaint is the allegation\u2019s classification, which is stated as \"Coercive Statements (Threats, Promises of Benefits, etc.)\" \nThe manifesto caused a media storm over the weekend, after Damore argued that biological differences between men and women are the cause of the gender gap at Google and the broader tech industry. Damore was fired on Monday \u2014 the same day he filed the suit \u2014 for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes\u201d and violating the company\u2019s code of conduct. \nDamore had previously told other news outlets he planned to file a complaint, with The New York Times reporting that he\u2019s claiming Google\u2019s upper management was \u201cmisrepresenting and shaming\u201d him. \u201cI have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does,\u201d Damore told The New York Times. Legal experts say the case has legs, with one lawyer telling Wired that \u201cDamore's lawyer might argue that his memo was protected under California law, because it related to allegedly unequal treatment of employees.\u201d\n\n\n"}
