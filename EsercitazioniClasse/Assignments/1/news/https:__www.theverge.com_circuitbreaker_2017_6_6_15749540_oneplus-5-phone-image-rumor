{"title": "The rumored OnePlus 5 looks a lot like the iPhone with its dual cameras", "content": " \nOnePlus is set to announce its OnePlus 5 flagship on June 20th, and today Android Police released a supposed image of the device that it says should be accurate. From the picture, we can see the device might launch with a dual-camera system and, well, that\u2019s kind of it. Oh, it\u2019ll also maybe be available in black to start, which would be different for OnePlus. The 3T wasn\u2019t initially available in black. \nWe don\u2019t have many details about the guts of the phone, other than the fact that it\u2019ll have Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 835 processor. We also know OnePlus is working with DxO to optimize camera performance.\nI wish we had more to share, but alas, this is all we got. I have a feeling we\u2019ll probably see more details leak out in the weeks to come, but for now, we can tell OnePlus is going for the iPhone look. \n"}
