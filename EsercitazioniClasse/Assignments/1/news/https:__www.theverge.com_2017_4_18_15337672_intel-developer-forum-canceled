{"title": "Intel kills off its PC-focused developer event", "content": " \nIntel is killing off its annual developer event. Hosted in San Francisco, the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was designed to provide developers with the latest information for Intel\u2019s chipsets and serve as an event to unveil new products. Intel has used IDF to launch processors like Skylake or Kaby Lake, and even some of its networking and storage solutions. Intel was scheduled to hold IDF in August this year, but a note on the company\u2019s site has revealed the conference has been canceled.\n\u201cIntel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward,\u201d says Intel. \u201cThank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum!\u201d Anandtech reports that Intel is cancelling its developer forum as the company has been changing its focus over the last few years. Intel is attempting to shift away from its PC reliance towards a focus on data with AI, IoT, wireless communications, and automotive areas.\nThe end of IDF is a reminder of Intel\u2019s struggles. Intel, like Microsoft, missed a huge mobile opportunity just as the PC market was set to decline. The majority of PCs, including Apple\u2019s range of Macs, use Intel\u2019s chipsets, but millions devices more use ARM-based processors inside smartphones. Intel announced at IDF last year that it will start building ARM-based smartphone chips, but we\u2019ve not seen the results of this production line change just yet. Intel is now expected to hold separate events for its announcements in the future, instead of revealing them all in a single event like IDF.\n"}
