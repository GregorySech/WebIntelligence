{"title": "Google Calendar finally has a proper iPad app", "content": " \nGoogle Calendar\u2019s iPhone app is not the most innovative calendar app on the iPhone by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s simple, straightforward, and relatively easy to use. But for people who use GSuite or advanced features in Google Calendar like booking rooms or \u201cfind a time,\u201d it\u2019s often the best option.\nUntil they switch to their iPad, that is, and they\u2019re faced with a garish, blown-up phone version of the app. \nThat changes today, as Google is finally rolling out an iPad-native version of Google Calendar. From what little we can glean from the screenshot above and Google\u2019s blog post, it looks like a shot-for-shot remake of the iPhone version, just utilizing the larger screen real estate better.\nLiterally as an addendum, Google is also promising that more updates are coming for Google Calendar on iOS \u2014 including a much-needed \u201cToday\u201d widget that will show upcoming events on the lock screen or in the notification shade. \nThe iPad app should be available for download today.\n"}
