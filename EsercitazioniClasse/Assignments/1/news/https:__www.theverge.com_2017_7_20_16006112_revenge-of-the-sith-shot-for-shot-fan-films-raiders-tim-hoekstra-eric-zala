{"title": "Obsessed fans are using shot-for-shot blockbuster remakes as their personal film school", "content": " \nHow do budding film buffs, lacking experience or funding, start making movies? Traditionally, there have been a few ways to pull it off. They can follow the conventional wisdom and go to film school, spending a few years writing and fundraising before taking on their own projects. They can go the vocational route and find studio work, taking tech roles on other people\u2019s movies before doing their own.\nBut now, it\u2019s also possible to be a nerd, pick up a smartphone, and cut together a film with no budget or training at all. Earlier this month, a group of eight New Zealand students filmed a shot-for-shot remake of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith over the course of five days. Thanks to its faithfulness to the original (and because it\u2019s adorably shitty), it swiftly went viral.\n\n\u201cMost of us were complete novices and have no real experience in creative arts, filmmaking, and the like,\u201d Tim Hoekstra, a member of the film\u2019s crew, tells The Verge. \u201cThe fact we could make a full-length feature film on a zero-dollar budget without any special equipment is pretty awesome.\u201d\n\u201cMost of us were complete novices with no experience in filmmaking.\u201d\nThanks to the proliferation of accessible, affordable gear and software, low-budget fan films have exploded on platforms like YouTube and Vimeo. And the shot-for-shot remake, which aims to painstakingly re-create beloved scenes and even entire movies, is enjoying a quiet yet extended moment in the sun, as both the purest expression of love for a nerdy property and one of the best ways to learn filmcraft. \nFan filmmaking is a huge and hallowed corner of fandom. Over the last several decades, amateur and professional filmmakers have produced movies drawing on everything from Star Wars and Star Trek to Venom and Power Rangers to show their devotion to the properties they love. As a genre, fan films exist between remixes and original work; they draw heavily from established canon, but often set out to do something new. And it\u2019s not uncommon that some of the best or most surprising ones develop followings of their own.\nShot-for-shot work lives a few steps deeper into the fan-film cottage industry. Directors set out to re-create every scene as faithfully as possible, with meticulous attention aimed at blocking, cadence, camera angles, and even the soundtrack. Like any movie, short, or even trailer, they vary wildly in quality. Gus Van Sant was reviled in 1998 when he claimed his $60 million Psycho remake would be a shot-for-shot duplicate of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s classic. On the other hand, Michael Haneke\u2019s 2007 English-language reproduction of his 1997 German-language film Funny Games was widely regarded as an interesting experiment.\n\u201cSweded\u201d movies are appealing because of how quirky and creative they can be\nAnd then there\u2019s 2008\u2019s Be Kind Rewind, which helped kick off a brief trend of \u201csweded,\u201d low-rent remakes of popular movies. Now, anyone can find any number of far more enjoyable remakes online that were made for pennies and look the part. Their appeal lies in how creative and quirky those involved have to be to pull off a no-budget remake of, say, Spider-Man: Homecoming.\n\nHoekstra and company \u2014 who\u2019ve decided to call themselves the Knights of Renesmee, a play on the Knights of Ren from The Force Awakens and Bella Cullen\u2019s daughter Renesmee in the Twilight saga \u2014 had just come down from a Star Wars marathon high when they decided to shoot their tribute film. They wanted to honor the franchise they adored by making their own version of their favorite movie in the series.\n\u201cRevenge of the Sith is probably our favorite Star Wars film,\u201d Hoekstra says, \u201cthough none of us were game enough to admit it, and we thought we could basically quote the entire film at the time. Turns out we couldn\u2019t, but we finished it anyway.\u201d\nThe entire film was shot with just a Samsung Galaxy A5. To make the bare-bones VFX, the Knights used Microsoft PowerPoint to create starfighters, and Rebaslight, a free tool made specifically to create lightsaber effects. The result is a bad movie, but one that sends up what most Star Wars nerds already regard as a bad movie. It\u2019s a loving parody that reminds the audience that Revenge of the Sith\u2019s more objectionable elements \u2014 the stilted dialogue, bad acting, and bizarrely misogynistic plotting \u2014 can still be fun, especially through a lo-fi lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly, the shot-for-shot project was an opportunity for the group to actually learn about filmmaking now that it\u2019s easy to try it with minimal investment. At the dawn of the home video boom, making anything like what Hoekstra and his friends pulled off would have been much harder.\n\u201cBack when we were doing this as kids in the '80s, as far as we knew, we were alone in the world,\u201d says Eric Zala, director of Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation, a shot-for-shot remake of Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1981 original. Zala and his friends Chris Strompolos and Jayson Lamb started the project back in 1982, but given the cost, the lack of low-budget home media tools, and the difficulty of accessing editing equipment, it took them seven years to finally complete it.\n\u201cWhen we finally finished shooting [in] 1988, our only means of avoiding consumer VHS-to-VHS editing strategy was a connection with the local TV station,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we used editing equipment when it wasn't being used, from 10 o'clock at night to 7 in the morning. You have to really, really want it, to live like a vampire for a whole summer at a TV station.\u201d\n\nFor Zala, who just completed a 65-city tour for Raiders! The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made, having the \u201cfire in the belly\u201d to go above and beyond for the film\u2019s sake is what really gets one made. Technology has made it possible to make a movie in five days, but that\u2019s still no substitute for the will to complete a project. That may explain why so many shot-for-shot remakes are science fiction fan films: fandom has no shortage of obsession and enthusiasm. And fandom is as good a place to start as any right now. At a time when genre movies from Marvel, DC, Lucasfilm, and even Hasbro have essentially taken over Hollywood, there are plenty of fan-beloved projects to pay homage to and poke fun at, with more released every week. Those efforts encourage a kind of appreciation for filmmaking that might not have been built in before the project began.\nFandom has no shortage of obsession and enthusiasm\n\u201cWhen we decided to remake Raiders when we were 11 and 12, we said, \u2018Okay, great!\u2019 I thought it was only gonna take a mere summer. Then on PBS, [we saw] Spielberg flipping through the storyboards. \u2018Storyboards\u2026 Yeah\u2026\u2019\u201d Inspired by those storyboards, Zala and friends wound up creating 602 of their own for their adaptation.\nFor Hoekstra and the Knights of Renesmee, their love of Episode III, as bad as it is, helped them start and finish their own shot-for-shot. That\u2019s worth commending on its own, but they\u2019re already raring for their next project.\n\u201cUpon rewatching the film,\u201d Hoekstra says, \u201cwe see tons of things we would do differently in future projects. And as the editor, I certainly will never watch a Star Wars movie the same way again. I watched Attack of the Clones last night and found myself constantly critiquing all the film's elements, and plotting how we could reinterpret them for our next project.\u201d\n\n"}
