 HTC is rumored to announce the U11 Plus, an updated successor to the U11 at an event in November, but an early leak from TENAA (China's version of the FCC) has given us an early look at the new smartphone, as spotted by Droid Life. Moving the fingerprint sensor to the backAnd as expected, the U11 Plus kind of looks like a larger version of the U11. It looks like HTC is making the screen larger and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back, which fits with rumors of a larger 6-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio display that cuts down on the original’s bezels. And while it’s hard to tell anything from the decidedly bland photography on display here, it looks like HTC will be bringing back the same shimmering colors as the U11.TENAA’s listing doesn’t include anything as to specifications, but to recap the earlier rumors, the U11 Plus is also said to have a Snapdragon 835 processor, a 12 megapixel rear camera, and IP68 water resistance, with the phone expected to come in two version: one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and a high-end model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Presumably, we’ll find out if those leaks are accurate when HTC formally announces the device on November 2nd.
