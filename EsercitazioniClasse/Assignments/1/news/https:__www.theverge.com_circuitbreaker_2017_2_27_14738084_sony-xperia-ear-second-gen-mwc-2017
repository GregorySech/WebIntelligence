{"title": "These shiny concept earphones are the latest vessel for Sony\u2019s digital assistant", "content": " \nSony has a compelling vision for the future of computing, but it doesn\u2019t always manage to follow through. Case in point, the company has announced at MWC today a new concept version of its Xperia Ear \u2014 a headphone with a built-in digital assistant (the Sony Agent).\nSony says the technology is \u201chands-free, eyes-free, and ears-free.\u201d And why ears-free? Because these headphones use something called \u201copen-ear\u201d technology that transmits sound \u201cdirectly to the ear canal.\u201d This has the same effect as the audio passthrough tech we\u2019ve seen in other wireless earphones \u2014 allowing users to listen to music and interact with an assistant while still hearing noise from the world around them.\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen some similar promises from Sony before, with the company not quite hitting the mark. The first-generation Xperia Ear was also announced as a concept before it went on sale last year. But it was a dud, with reviewers citing limited functionality and poor battery life as reasons to give it a wide berth. \nPerhaps the new and improved Ear will solve some of these issues. Sony says it\u2019s still improving on its digital assistant, and has announced a new \u201cAnytime Talk\u201d feature that makes it easy to start a group call \u201cwithout searching through contacts or needing to dial.\u201d (This functionality will be coming to first-generation Xperia Ears sometime in the next couple of months.) \nWe\u2019ll hopefully be able to try out the new Xperia Ear ourselves at MWC, and see if it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on. Stay tuned. \n"}
