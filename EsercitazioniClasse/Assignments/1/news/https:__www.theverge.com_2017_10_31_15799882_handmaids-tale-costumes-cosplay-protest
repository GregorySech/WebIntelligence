{"content": " \nIn March 2017, a group of women marched into Texas\u2019 state capitol building, dressed in the scarlet robes and puritanical white bonnets of the Handmaids from Hulu\u2019s about-to-be-released show The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Based on the novel by Margaret Atwood, the show depicts a dystopian world where women are brutally stripped of their rights and exploited for reproduction. The theme was no accident; the women were there to protest a bill that would restrict abortions in the state. They sat silently in the balcony, surrounded by armed police officers, sending a message with their presence \u2014 turning cosplay into a political act, and inspiring a national anti-abortion protest movement that has adopted the costume as a de facto uniform.\nThe protest was loosely inspired by a Hulu promotional event prior to the launch of the series, where models donned the garb of the show\u2019s iconic Handmaids at this year\u2019s SXSW festival. News of the stunt reached Heather Busby, the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time Pro-Choice Texas used costumes,\u201d she explained in a phone interview with The Verge. \u201cBack in 2015, we had folks in hospital gowns to protest another abortion restriction. We had an inkling that this kind of thing is effective, and the timing of the show coming out, and with the book experiencing a resurgence in popularity, it seemed like the perfect convergence of all those things.\u201d\nShe and other members began to talk on Facebook about protesting a pair of anti-abortion bills: SB 415, a bill designed by the National Right to Life Committee, which would limit abortion procedures in the second trimester, and SB 25, which would protect doctors from lawsuits and let them conceal conditions that might prompt an abortion. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Hey, they should go down to the capitol,\u2019 which led a couple of folks to say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go make costumes and do this.\u2019\u201d \n\n\nWomen attended legislation sessions at the Texas capitol today dressed in Handsmaid's Tale uniforms.

Six weeks later, protesters in Missouri donned similar costumes and protested a budget provision that would bar uninsured women from getting services from a doctor or facility that refers them to abortion providers. \nWord of the protests has reached the show\u2019s costume designer Ane Crabtree. Prior to the protests in Texas, the protesters reached out to her for costume advice. She couldn\u2019t help directly, she told ThinkProgress, but she passed along general costuming tips, and told them that she was with them \u201cin spirit.\u201d As the pictures rolled in on Twitter, Crabtree said she \u201csat and couldn\u2019t move for an hour\u201d because she \u201cwas sobbing so hard with joy.\u201d\nDonning costumes isn\u2019t exactly a new step for protesters, however. In 1913, supporters for women\u2019s suffrage donned costumes depicting Columbia, the female personification of America. Cosplay protests aren\u2019t limited to progressive movements, either. In 2009 and 2010, members of the Tea Party donned costumes from Revolutionary War-era figures to promote their cause.\nWilliam Temple, a historical reenactor who participated in several Tea Party protests, told The Verge that the purpose was to \u201cremind folks of the first revolution and make the visual connection,\u201d and of the founders\u2019 intentions to establish a limited government.\nThe Handmaids from Hulu\u2019s show \u2014 and Atwood\u2019s book \u2014 play a similar symbolic role for protesters on the other side of the aisle. Soon after the protests in Texas, Emily Morgan of New Hampshire recognized the potential to expand the Handmaid protests across the country to state legislatures where politicians had proposed new measures to roll back abortion protections. \nWhen The Daily Beast broke a story in April about a New Hampshire lawmaker who secretly set up a misogynist subreddit group called The Red Pill, Morgan organized a protest where all the participants would wear Handmaid costumes. She set up a website called The Handmaid\u2019s Coalition, and began reaching out to other groups. Their slogan was simple: \u201cFighting to keep fiction from becoming reality.\u201d\nThe site serves as a guide for prospective organizers, while the organization\u2019s Facebook page highlights its members in costume at various protests, as well as various efforts to introduce anti-abortion legislation. The site also hosts a manual called The Handmaid\u2019s Guide, which offers tips on making the costumes and organizing participants, plus information on protestors\u2019 rights.\nOver the course of the summer, more Handmaid protesters appeared across the country, guided in part by The Handmaid\u2019s Coalition. Regional groups appeared in places like Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, and even internationally, to protest anti-abortion legislation. In October, Morgan and her group spearheaded an effort to hold a protest at the state capitol in every state, and more recently, appeared at the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit over the weekend of October 27th. In recent months, The Handmaid\u2019s Coalition has only grown larger, with nearly 700 members in the US, Canada, and Europe.  \nMorgan says the costume itself is an incredibly useful tool for demonstration, not just because of its symbolic weight, but also because of the uniform\u2019s practical benefits. The bonnet\u2019s wings can help protect protestors\u2019 identities, and the uniformity of the costumes helps the group present a unified image \u2014 including for male allies who wear the costume to participate.\nCrabtree says the protests were effective because they tap into something primal. While silent presence is a simple form of protest, it forces attention to the issues everywhere the costumed protestors arrive. \u201cIt was women with signs as women have done since the beginning of time,\u201d says Crabtree, \u201cquietly and effectively stating: This is wrong.\u201d\n", "title": "How The Handmaid\u2019s Tale inspired a protest movement"}
