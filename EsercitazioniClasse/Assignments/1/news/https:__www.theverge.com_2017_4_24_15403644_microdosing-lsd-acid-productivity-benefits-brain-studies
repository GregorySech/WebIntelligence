{"title": "LSD microdoses make people feel sharper, and scientists want to know how", "content": " \nMay didn\u2019t notice much with the first dose of LSD. She felt good, and she got a lot accomplished, and that was all. \nIt was the day after that things really clicked. She felt even better, and she got a lot more accomplished. She repeated this pattern for a month \u2014 one 10-microgram dose of LSD every fourth day \u2014 as per the regimen recommended by psychologist and microdosing research pioneer James Fadiman\u2019s protocol, made mainstream-famous by Ayelet Waldman\u2019s monthlong LSD self-study chronicled in last year\u2019s A Really Good Day.\n\u201cIt's certainly not euphoric or like a high of any sort at all.\u201d\n\u201cI did a little experiment,\u201d says May, a 64-year-old psychotherapist in Marin County requesting anonymity. \u201cIt was this game on my iPad that I was kind of stuck on, and I noticed that whenever I was on day two of the microdosing [regimen], my performance was significantly better.\u201d \nThis wasn\u2019t May\u2019s first time doing acid. She\u2019d taken LSD (full name: lysergic acid diethylamide) sporadically over the past 40 years. This was, however, her first foray into microdosing. She\u2019d heard promises that microdosing LSD would yield heightened productivity and dissipate mental clutter. \nMicrodosing provided that sharpness for May, as advertised. \n\u201cFor me, it's just clarity. It's like how you would feel if you had a really good, deep rest, and then woke up and were able to focus very clearly.\u201d \n\nMicrodosing is trendy. From Waldman\u2019s 2016 book and media tour, to coverage at Marie Claire and The New Yorker, to fodder for podcasts geared toward self-described psychonauts and psychedelic-naive laypeople alike, to how-to manuals and private \u201cmicrodosing coaching\u201d sessions at $97 a pop, low-dose psychedelic use has become the drug fad du jour. The subscribers on a Reddit forum devoted to microdosing nearly quintupled in the span of a year and a half, as Wired noted last summer. Then, there were 7,500 members. The forum has doubled in size in the year since then.\nThe machinery of science moves much more slowly than hype\nSo what\u2019s happening physiologically to someone on a low dose of LSD? In the absence of hard science, reports from volunteers like May make up the only existing literature. And if the dose is in fact very, very micro, not much happens at all. Says May, \u201cI did not have any sensory stuff tied to it.\u201d On occasions where she\u2019d taken higher doses of LSD in the past, she\u2019d experienced some hallmarks of an altered state, but not with microdosing. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was going for.\u201d\nAll reporting on microdosing\u2019s purported benefits has been anecdotal, speculative. The machinery of science moves much more slowly than hype. But the science is starting to catch up. The first glimpses of data on microdosing were presented on April 21, at Psychedelic Science 2017, a six-day summit in Oakland of more than 100 clinical researchers and physicians and 2,500 psychedelic enthusiasts. Fadiman shared results from his ongoing study\u2019s first 418 volunteers. (He\u2019s hesitant to call them \u201csubjects,\u201d because his study doesn\u2019t follow classic research design.) People sign up to receive his self-study protocol and instructions online, which detail the month-long plan that May and Waldman followed. The participants have to find the study drugs on their own. A notice on the study\u2019s site reads, \u201cPlease DO NOT ASK US about: how or where to find substances. [sic]\u201d\nLSD isn\u2019t the only microdose included in the protocol; psilocybin (the active alkaloid in magic mushrooms) and iboga (a psychoactive shrub) are part of it as well, plus other psychedelics as long as they\u2019re dosed somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the \u201cnormal recreational dose.\u201d For LSD, Fadiman accepts self-reports from individuals ingesting between 8 and 15 micrograms, though he recommends starting with 10. A daily check-in instrument asks contributors to rate their mood, productivity, and energy on a scale.\n\u201cAnd then we ask people to write us a report,\u201d says Fadiman in an interview with The Verge. \u201cWhich is where, from my point of view, things get really interesting.\u201d \nFadiman and co-investigator Sophia Korb\u2019s site went up in February; over 1,000 people have filed self-reports to date. On one (really good) day, participants submitting write-ups hailed from nine different countries.\nHe briefly shares a few stories from the project with me: A man suffering depression credits microdosing with giving him the confidence to bid for a whole project on behalf of his company, rather than for a small piece. An engineer who says he gains the ability to see all the moving parts of the machine he\u2019s working on in synchronicity, rather than fixating on one aspect. Another individual who, Fadiman reports, \u201csaid it very nicely: \u2018I\u2019m a much better version of myself.\u2019\u201d There are two big takeaways from Fadiman\u2019s results so far: microdosing can be an aid for productivity, and it can provide relief for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nLSD is mostly known as the mascot for 1960s counterculture. Its widespread use became one of the impetuses for 1970\u2019s Controlled Substances Act. But there are no known overdose deaths attributed to LSD. Psychedelic resource Erowid does report on a low number of deaths associated with LSD, and advises caution. In some cases, though, deaths linked to LSD were either not LSD at all (other drugs come on blotters, too), or the result of accidents or suicide on especially high doses.\nThe tiny dose is also the selling point\nSays Erowid, \u201cPut simply, LSD does not cause death at recreational or therapeutic doses (less than 500 [micrograms]).\u201d Microdosing is one-fiftieth of that amount.\n\u201cLSD is a totally amazing substance,\u201d says Ralph Metzner, a psychopharmacologist considered a forefather of LSD research. \u201cBecause it is so potent, and such tiny amounts and tiny differences in tiny amounts make such a huge difference. [\u2026] Its sensitivity is off the charts. There's no other drug that comes close to that kind of sensitivity.\u201d \nMicrodosing\u2019s tiny dose is its key selling point. \u201cThe benefit of it being micro is you go about your normal daily activities,\u201d says Rick Doblin, executive director of psychedelic research nonprofit MAPS. \u201cYour cognitive processing is slightly enhanced in certain ways \u2014 more creative, more focused, little bit of a mood elevation \u2014 but you're not in any way tripping. And you can drive. You can do all sorts of things that you wouldn't do if the dose were higher.\u201d \nMicrodosing is quiet, reflective\nLex Pelger, a 34-year-old biochemist and writer in Brooklyn, agrees that the effects are so mild they\u2019re almost imperceptible. Pelger hosts Psymposia, an events group centered on psychedelic science, and says he microdoses every couple days, finding it helpful for interviewing, lecturing, and writing. \u201cYou just don\u2019t need as much coffee that day,\u201d he says.\nMicrodosing also has some history. Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist credited as the first person to synthesize and ingest LSD in 1943, told Metzner that he self-experimented with low doses of LSD in his later years, circa the 1990s. \u201cJust to think,\u201d Metzner says. Microdosing is quiet, reflective. Metzner likens it to taking a vitamin. \nAnd though modern clinical investigations of psychedelics regulate dosage, mindset, and the environment around test subjects to ensure streamlined data, they can\u2019t account for two factors that Metzner says determine the quality and intensity of a psychedelic experience: individual variability and learned sensitivity. Every individual will react to a psychedelic, particularly LSD, in a unique way. That microdosing is \u201cmicro\u201d renders it a teaching tool. \n\u201cIt's like learning to use a microscope,\u201d says Metzner. \u201cHow to adjust the lens, and of course you have to know what it is that you're looking at.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we wait for the definitive science on what microdosing does in the body, it\u2019s possible to review what we know about larger doses of LSD.  A new report will soon be out from the Center for Brain and Cognition at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona that does just that. The scientists collected data from the rainbow-hued neuroimages of twelve brains on LSD, taken in fMRI sessions  by a team at Imperial College London last year. The goal was to try a new analysis that might lead to more information on how the drug works, says computational neuroscientist Selen Atasoy of her collaboration with Imperial. \u201cWe wanted to look at the dynamics, rather than static images [...] to analyze how brain activity changes over time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really like jazz improvisation, what LSD does to your brain.\u201d\nAtasoy and her team translated Imperial\u2019s data into what they call \u201charmonic brain states.\u201d Basically, the fMRI measures blood flow to brain structures; each unique pattern of brain activation gets a \u201cfrequency,\u201d which Atasoy likens to a musical note. The notes can then be strung together. By doing this, the researchers can see how many brain states the volunteers went through \u2014 or the \u201ccomplexity of the music,\u201d as Atasoy puts it \u2014 and compare that to a placebo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really like jazz improvisation, what LSD does to your brain,\u201d says Atasoy. \u201cYour brain seems to use many more of these brain states, similar to [how] in improvisation, people use many more musical notes.\u201d And as with jazz improvisation, the notes are not random, Atasoy says. \nThe idea of harmonic brain states is relatively new; the first publication was from Atasoy last year. \u201cI would say in general the concept of \u2018harmonic brain states\u2019 does not enjoy a huge following,\u201d says Robert Bilder, a neuropsychologist at UCLA. The research is interesting and seems well done, he says.\nNeuroimaging studies for low-dose LSD are on the way\nImperial College London\u2019s neuroimaging study used 75 micrograms of LSD, a dose seven and a half times larger than a true microdose. Still, the results on higher doses can provide insight on what happens to people like May on low doses. \u201cI expect that the microdose would enable some flexibility while you can still remain focused, while you can still maintain that structure,\u201d says Atasoy. Any theories on microdosing are still speculation for now. \nBut neuroimaging studies for low-dose LSD are on the way. Amanda Feilding, director of the UK-based Beckley Foundation, announced at Psychedelic Science that a microdosing LSD study will take place at Imperial later this year. The plan is to recruit 20 participants to test a variety of LSD doses. Then they\u2019ll play the strategy game Go inside an fMRI machine \u2014 while researchers monitor their brains\u2019 blood flow. \n\u201cI rather love brain imaging in the sense that it gives you a pictorial explanation,\u201d Feilding tells The Verge, pulling out a sample of the neuroimages from Beckley and Imperial\u2019s moderate-dose LSD study last year. Feilding designed the microdosing protocol to learn more about how a low dose of LSD affects the brain. \u201cI just want to go in more deeply, trying to track down the physiological basis of the reported feelings of increased well being, or overcoming depression or [improving] cognitive functioning.\u201d The study isn\u2019t yet funded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a craze microdosing has become,\u201d says Viceland\u2019s Hamilton Morris in a recent live podcast recording of The Duncan Trussell Family Hour. \u201cI would\u2019ve never expected that the way to get everybody interested in psychedelics was to make them not psychedelic.\u201d\nThe secret weapon of microdosing is that it is kind of a ho-hum experience\nMicrodosing LSD sounds like a trip, but its secret weapon is that it is, all said, a ho-hum experience. Many of the studies in the current wave of clinical psychedelic research add to this perceived tameness; after all, the aim appears to be making LSD legal for prescription or therapeutic use. To do that, the \u201cOrange Sunshine\u201d of the \u201860s must be deemed respectable, which in the United States means pharmaceutical. There\u2019s a future where LSD is not simply decriminalized but also legally accessible, says Ethan Nadelmann, founder and outgoing executive director of Drug Policy Alliance, who Rolling Stone has dubbed \u201cthe real drug czar.\u201d\n\u201cThe information that's increasingly coming out about microdosing makes it more likely that it will happen sooner than later,\u201d says Nadelmann. \u201cIt's presenting a growing segment of the public with a new perspective on LSD, and it's something that really shatters the images of LSD that people may have in their minds.\u201d\nLSD is synthetic, which makes it easier to accurately measure dosage compared to plant-based psychedelics or cannabis. That means the effects of prescription LSD would be much easier to replicate. (The same holds true for synthetic psilocybin.) More studies will be needed to establish that micodosing works and is safe for that to happen, says Nadelmann.\nIn fact, findings from the first known scientific study investigating safety and tolerability of low-dose LSD were slated to go public at Psychedelic Science last weekend. But three weeks before the scheduled presentation, lead investigator Neiloufar Family and her UK-based team at Eleusis Benefit Corporation, a pharmaceutical company, withdrew their study from the conference lineup, leaving the timing for LSD\u2019s prescription drug future uncertain.\n\u201cCertainly, nobody else is working with LSD in a drug development context,\u201d says Doblin. \u201cSo if their study isn't the first step, there is no first step.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nFamily told The Verge that she and her team are hoping to have everything completed this summer, but are unable to comment on the study until that time. When reached for clarification via email, Eleusis\u2019s founder Shlomi Raz wrote that though the clinical trial is complete, its analysis continues, alongside other studies in process.\u201cWe hope to be able to release these aggregated findings at the same time so as to provide the scientific, medical, and broader public with a more comprehensive perspective on the research and its implications,\u201d Raz wrote in the email. \nRaz declined to comment on whether Eleusis plans to patent and sell low-dose LSD for prescription use. \u201cThey're pretty secretive,\u201d says Doblin, \u201cso I'm not exactly sure what's going on.\u201d\nThat leaves Fadiman with the only game in town: an ongoing self-report study. It may serve as a road map for the next round of needed clinical LSD research. \u201cMicrodosing is a case study in citizen science,\u201d he says of his 1,000-participant-and-growing study. \u201cThere's no way that conventional science could really replicate what we're doing.\u201d Approved double-blind studies at research hospitals like Johns Hopkins, New York University, and Harbor-UCLA are the gold standard for research in the field. But these studies are very small, sometimes with 20 participants or fewer. Fadiman\u2019s admittedly messier work does serve its own purpose, then \u2014 by gathering experiences from larger groups of people. That may guide future controlled trials by suggesting new questions about these psychedelic drugs.\nHere\u2019s an example: Fadiman reads an email from a British art historian in her 20s, long afflicted with painful, irregular menstruation. \u201c\u2018I only microdosed that one month. My periods are regular. You have changed my life. Thank you.\u2019 I\u2019ve been in psychedelic research a long, long time, and no one\u2019s ever considered or mentioned or thought about the possibility that psychedelics had anything do with menstrual periods, particularly difficult ones. However, now that that bit of search has happened, we started looking for it.\u201d Twelve women, he says, have reported improved menstruation after microdosing.\n\nIf you think this is the part of the story where we tell you that May\u2019s life has changed because of her microdosing, it\u2019s not. Because her life hasn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cWhile you're doing it, it's very useful,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you stop, you stop.\u201d She hasn\u2019t microdosed since. \n\u201cI can get to the same state of consciousness with daily meditation practice\u201d\nFor May, withdrawal after LSD left her system \u2014 a feeling she can best describe as a \u201cvague sense of difficulty getting your traction\u201d \u2014 was enough for her to not repeat the month over. Microdosing is not something she\u2019d want to do every day. She sees its value for someone with ADD or ADHD, especially as an alternative to Adderall. But that\u2019s not the case with May. \n\u201cTo be honest with you, I can get to the same state of consciousness with daily meditation practice, and that's more sustainable,\u201d says May. \nHer fellow microdoser, Pelger also admits it\u2019s possible to experience the heightened concentration through more mundane means. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bit harder to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201dJust like reaching the mystical mountaintop is a little bit harder to achieve via yoga than via LSD.\u201d He still microdoses occasionally, either with psilocybin or LSD, when he feels he needs it.\nIf the scientific studies emerge to support it, microdosing LSD could be just like any other prescription drug experience: useful for some, less so for others, and perhaps best prescribed as temporary treatment. And like other drugs, there are some people who probably shouldn\u2019t use it at all.\nFor instance, Fadiman has learned not to recommend microdosing to people who experience anxiety, since anxiety seems to be exacerbated by even small doses of LSD. And though his research in the 1960s found a correlation between high-dose LSD and scientific breakthrough of \u201cunsolvable problems,\u201d this study hasn\u2019t produced the same results for microdosing. \nBut if there\u2019s any hope for microdosing\u2019s prescription drug future, it\u2019s that the least trippy and most clinical of scientific studies must pave the way. As Doblin points out, \u201cYou can't get FDA approval for personal growth.\u201d\n\nStephie Grob Plante is the daughter of Charles Grob, a psychiatrist who studies MDMA, ayahuasca, and psilocybin for use in therapy. \n"}
