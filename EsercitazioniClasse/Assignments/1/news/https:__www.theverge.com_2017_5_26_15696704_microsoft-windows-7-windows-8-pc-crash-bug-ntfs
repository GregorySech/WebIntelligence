{"title": "New bug allows websites to crash Windows 7 or Windows 8 PCs", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been a bad month for Windows 7 users. The widespread WannaCry ransomware hit mostly Windows 7 machines, and now a new bug has been discovered that will slow down and crash Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs. Ars Technica reports that the bug allows a malicious website to try and load an image file with the \u201c$MFT\u201d name in the directory path. Windows uses \u201c$MFT\u201d for special metadata files that are used by NTFS file system, and Windows 7 and Windows 8 fail to handle this directory name correctly.\nThe Verge has successfully tested the bug on a Windows 7 PC with the default Internet Explorer browser. Using a filename with \u201cc:\\$MFT\\123\u201d in a website image, our test caused a machine to slow down to the point where you have to reboot to get the PC working again. Some machines may even bluescreen eventually, as the file system locks to that file and all other apps are unable to access files. The strange bug doesn\u2019t affect Windows 10 users, and it\u2019s similar to an old problem in Windows 95 and Windows 98 where references to \u201cc:\\con\\con\u201d would crash a machine. \nThe NTFS bug appears to have been discovered earlier this week, and has been reported to Microsoft. It\u2019s not yet clear when Microsoft will deliver a fix for the problem, but it affects Windows Vista (which is unsupported), Windows 7, and Windows 8 machines.\n"}
