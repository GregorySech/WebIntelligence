{"title": "Final Fantasy XV is getting a VR fishing spinoff", "content": " \nThe Final Fantasy XV virtual reality spinoff has a new look. At its E3 keynote today, Sony showed off a new PlayStation VR experience called Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV. It appears to be a game entirely based around fishing, the favorite hobby of protagonist Prince Noctis. Fans might notice that the game is also quite different from the VR experience shown as last year\u2019s E3, which was an arcade-style shooter starring Prompto. Then again, that demo didn\u2019t feel much like a Final Fantasy game during our demo \u2014 so the change could be for the best. It\u2019s launching on PSVR in September.\n"}
