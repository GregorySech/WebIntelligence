{"title": "These next-generation space suits could allow astronauts to explore Mars", "content": " \nPicking out what to wear for work every day is a fairly routine process for most people. For astronauts, however, having the right outfit for the job is a matter of life and death. \nSpace suits are crucial for keeping crew members alive, and shielding them from the harsh vacuum of space during trips outside the International Space Station. And when we travel beyond lower Earth orbit \u2014 perhaps to the Moon or to Mars someday \u2014 suits will be a necessary tool. In the season premiere of Space Craft, we dove into the world of space suit design to find out what it takes to make an interplanetary ensemble.\nSpace suits are an essential part of the astronaut experience\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s no easy feat. Making a space suit is an incredibly complex design process, involving the interplay of hundreds of different materials \u2014 from aluminum alloys to flexible textiles. And a life-support system that circulates oxygen through the suit basically has to sit on the astronaut\u2019s back. \u201cIt's very difficult to contain a human inside basically what is a bag full of oxygen,\u201d says Pablo de Le\u00f3n, director of the space suit laboratory at the University of North Dakota.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does a suit need to keep people alive, but it needs to be flexible enough to work in. \u201cYou have to create it in a way that is mobile, that is comfortable for the astronaut, that is safe and will protect him or her from the vacuum and all the other dangers that you have in space,\u201d says de Le\u00f3n. \u201cIt's really a challenge.\u201d It doesn\u2019t always work out perfectly. For years, astronauts with particularly wide hands lost a few fingernails after wearing space suit gloves.\nPlus, there\u2019s no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d design. Space suits have to be specifically tailored for where an astronaut is going. If that destination is Mars, for instance, designers have to take into consideration the Red Planet\u2019s temperature and atmospheric conditions, as well as the type of dust that the suit will come in contact with. And then there\u2019s the gravity of a planet to think about. The Moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which will make objects feel much lighter than they do on our planet. That can have a big influence on the design of a lunar suit.\n\u201cFor the Moon, you can get by with more weight \u2014 more weight in your portable life-support system that will provide you with oxygen and the right temperature,\u201d says de Le\u00f3n. \u201cOn Mars, it's more complicated because we have more gravity than on the Moon, so you have to make it more lightweight.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe students and professors at UND have built two prototype suits for deep-space missions: the NDX-1, which is meant to be used on the Martian surface, and the NDX-2, for lunar excursions. I got to try on both of these innovative outfits at the UND campus, and it really taught me just how restrictive a space suit can be. Picking up simple objects or using tools isn\u2019t as easy as you think inside a suit. You can check out how I fared in the first episode above. \n\n"}
