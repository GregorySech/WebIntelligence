{"title": "American Satan is about a rock band that makes a deal with the devil, who also claims he founded Apple", "content": " \nThis fall, The Verge is making a choice. The choice is fear! We\u2019ve decided to embrace the season by taking in as many new horror movies as possible and reporting back on which ones are worth your time. We\u2019re calling this series Hold My Hand, as we look at films you might want to watch with a supportive viewing partner. Get comfortable, put the kettle on, check the closet for ghosts, then find a hand to squeeze until the bones pop.\nThe trailer for American Satan was emailed to me in a typo-riddled press release promising a starring turn for Game of Thrones\u2019 John Bradley, who plays Samwell Tarly. His character is named Ricky Rollins. If that was not already more than enough to sell me, American Satan is billed as a supernatural thriller about a rock band called Relentless, which makes a deal with the devil for fame, fortune, and to save Denise Richards from breast cancer. All they have to do is murder a rude competitor played by Nickelodeon\u2019s Drake Bell, most recently in the news for sparring with Josh Peck about a wedding invitation snub, and endorsing Donald Trump. \nAmerican Satan was directed and co-written by Ash Avildsen, the CEO of indie heavy-metal label Sumerian Records, with help from B-movie connoisseur Matty Beckerman. In the space of 90 minutes, it captures some of the worst acting ever committed to film, four semi-impressive (and very loud) musical numbers, a chilling performance by industry workhorse Malcolm McDowell as Satan (also referred to as \u201cMr. Capricorn\u201d), a monologue about Steve Jobs, a rash of murders, and what feels like \u2014 if you are watching the movie in the cafeteria of a busy office building \u2014 14 hours of Eyes Wide Shut-inspired sex scenes. \nUnfortunately, John Bradley is not the star of the movie. He spends most of it looking nervous and eating plates of cocaine. Aside from the drugs, it isn\u2019t a huge departure from his signature role. The star of American Satan is actually Andy Biersack, the 26-year-old lead singer of real-life Cincinnati glam metal band Black Veil Brides. He has no acting ability whatsoever, but does have very sad eyes and a remarkable resemblance to Tyson Ritter circa 2008. He is not super enthused about the deal with Satan, and finds it challenging to accept that his girlfriend \u2014 played by former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo \u2014 has to finish high school before she can join him in Los Angeles. \nLarry King is also in this movie, playing himself. It feels almost as if you shouldn\u2019t need any more convincing at this point, but let\u2019s proceed through our usual questions anyway.\n\nIs it scary? \nI don\u2019t know about you, but I find being totally unmoored inside a bizarre, campy trash pile at least as scary as a conventional \u201cghosts and stuff\u201d scary story. American Satan is scary because as soon as someone signs a pact with the devil, you know some bad situations are going to arise, but you don\u2019t know exactly when, or how bad. In this movie, they\u2019re pretty bad! The devil is a messed-up dude, so he spends several minutes explaining how he helped Steve Jobs found Apple, claiming that\u2019s why the original Apple computer retailed for $666.66. (This appears to be true, which is pretty weird of someone.) Mr. Capricorn claims his influence explains why the company logo is a piece of \u201cforbidden fruit,\u201d with a bite taken out of it. This part of the movie is frightening because \u2014 while you\u2019re in the thick of it, suspending disbelief and enjoying a supernatural horror film \u2014 you have to wonder\u2026 why did they pick that logo? Afterward, you can look it up and see it has nothing to do with Satan. \n\u201cDon\u2019t bite the apple, Eve!\u201d\nThis is unrelated, but the devil also tells the band members that he wrote \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d for Jay Z, which isn\u2019t a great brag if you ask me. It\u2019s a terrible song, and I\u2019m embarrassed just thinking back for two seconds on how it defined the era of my life during which I badly wanted to grow up to be a person who lives in New York City. And Jay Z specifically says \u201cDon\u2019t bite the apple, Eve!\u201d in that song, so this plot point doesn\u2019t even really make sense. \nWill I care about the characters? \nHopefully, no. Andy Biersack\u2019s sad-boy rock star character Johnny Faust (a too-easy reference) is supposed to elicit empathy because he is the only person in the band who feels a little bad about murdering Drake Bell. The morality bar should perhaps be a little higher. American Satan is mostly preoccupied with Johnny\u2019s descent into the classic pitfalls of rock n roll stardom, including sex, drugs, and accidentally killing a crazed racist in a \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d state, thereby becoming an unwilling hero to gun-toting conservatives across America. Dozens of films have done a better job of making me feel empathy for someone in the position of ill-gotten, unenjoyable success, including 2009\u2019s forgotten gem Hannah Montana: The Movie. Faust\u2019s character is just a paper cutout of a conflicted person. \nMaybe you will care about John Bradley\u2019s Ricky Rollins, who is not the star of the movie, though his Game of Thrones connection has been a major marketing point. If nothing else, Ricky seems a lot more sensible than everyone else, at least for a while. Maybe you will care about CNN host who has to ask the members of Relentless whether they think their devil-praise songs and trigger-happy lead singer are causing copycat murders and a new rash of public Satan worship. How exactly did this happen for you, my dude? \nIs it visually impressive? \nThe devil horn masks from the Eyes Wide Shut scenes are elaborate and terrifying, a wonder to behold. The rest of this movie sort of looks like a cable news segment.\nWhat\u2019s lurking beneath the surface? \nOn the surface, American Satan is a horror movie about how the devil is bad, and entering into vague contracts with him will not make you happy. I\u2019m not sure what audiences are supposed to get out of it otherwise, but \u201cthe devil is bad, and entering into vague contracts with him will not make you happy\u201d is also the top-level message of the 1989 film The Little Mermaid. Under the surface of that movie (pun intended, sorry!), there was a second message that went something like \u201canything you do for love is all right in the end.\u201d \nI don\u2019t want to spoil the conclusion of American Satan, but there are several parallels between these two scrappy entries in the surrealist \u201cfinding your voice\u201d genre. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Sumerian Records\n\n\nHow can I watch it? \nAmerican Satan opened in limited release in the US, Canada, Australia, and Mexico on October 13th.\nIs it a hand-holding movie?\nNo. You will likely need your hands for other things, like putting in earplugs, or checking IMDb on your phone every five minutes. You\u2019ll be doing a lot of \u201cWhere do I recognize this guy from?\u201d and \u201cWhat was the trajectory of his life prior to now?\u201d and \u201cHow do I avoid ever experiencing a remotely similar trajectory?\u201d\nIf you want to hold hands, may I suggest: \n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article listed Sebastian Bach as a member of the cast. He is erroneously listed on the film\u2019s IMDb page but is not in the film. Lines delivered by a CNN anchor were also misattributed to a character played by Larry King. \n"}
