{"title": "AOC\u2019s latest Agon monitor is a $429.99 curved QHD designed for gaming", "content": " \nAOC has a new monitor out, the Agon AG322QCX, and it\u2019s built for gaming. The Agon AG322QCX is on the wider end of the spectrum, measuring in at 32 inches, with a 1800R curve, but still offering proper QHD resolution at 2560 x 1440. \nThe increased resolution is nice to see from a widescreen monitor like this, which tend to max out at 1080 pixels tall \u2014 although I wouldn\u2019t complain if the AG322QCX had a few more few vertical pixels either.\nMoving on to the more gaming-focused specs, AG322QCX has a 144Hz refresh rate, a 4ms response time, and support for AMD\u2019s FreeSync technology. There are definitely monitors with higher refresh rates and faster response times out there, but for most gamers, what\u2019s on offer here should be plenty for most users. Slightly more disappointing is the choice of AMD\u2019s FreeSync over Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync, which tends to be preferable, especially given Nvidia\u2019s prevalence in the GPU scene. \nOn the port front, the AG322QCX has a VGA port, two HDMI ports, two Display Ports, and two USB 3.0 ports, which means that you should be able to plug it in to almost any modern computer. (Sadly, there\u2019s no USB-C.)\nThe AG322QCX is available now for $429.99. \n"}
