{"title": "Google ARCore gives Android users augmented reality without Tango", "content": " \nLast week in San Francisco, Google showed me an app called Oz. Oz is a kind of augmented reality picture book: it places animated characters from The Wizard of Oz into the physical world, as viewed through a smartphone camera. I\u2019d tried it a few months earlier at Google I/O, running on the Tango AR platform, and the content hadn\u2019t changed. But the experience was far more interesting \u2014 because for the first time, it could run on a phone that I use every day.\nThis version of Oz was built on a system called ARCore, which debuts today as a limited preview. As its name suggests, ARCore is Android\u2019s equivalent to Apple ARKit: a baked-in augmented reality platform for developers. Where Tango\u2019s custom hardware requirements have left it languishing on mediocre smartphones, ARCore is less powerful but more accessible. It\u2019s launching on the year-old Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S8 phones, supported by Android 7.0 Nougat as well as its recently released successor Android Oreo. An official launch is loosely planned for this winter, when Google promises ARCore will work with 100 million existing and upcoming devices.\nGoogle is under pressure to compete with Apple, but it says ARCore is a long-term project\nGoogle is under obvious pressure to compete with Apple\u2019s lightweight version of AR, which has produced a small wave of clever experiments since its announcement in June. But the company\u2019s head of augmented and virtual reality, Clay Bavor, describes ARCore as an intentional long-term outgrowth of Tango. \u201cOur approach with Tango was to un-constrain ourselves,\u201d Bavor says. \u201cThat really let us learn a lot, figure out what the use cases are, and push forward the technology \u2014 out ahead of what would have been possible with standard smartphone hardware.\u201d Google released a couple of consumer products with Tango, but they\u2019ve had little mainstream appeal. Meanwhile, he says, Google was taking key pieces and adapting them for ordinary phones, where they could work without Tango\u2019s two extra cameras.\nNow that Google considers ARCore good enough for a wide release, Tango-branded devices \u2014 like the Asus ZenFone AR that came out just a few weeks ago \u2014 seem to be a thing of the past. \u201cI think Tango fades into the background as more an enabling technology that kind of works behind the scenes,\u201d says Bavor. It\u2019s not technically dead; Google will supposedly keep pushing for new and better cameras based on Tango tech, like a depth sensor. But these would be added to phones as an element of ARCore, not a discrete feature.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google describes it, ARCore has three basic components. The first is motion tracking, which estimates a phone\u2019s relative location based on internal sensors and video footage \u2014 so you can pin objects in one place and walk around them. The second is environmental understanding, which uses the camera to detect flat surfaces. The third is light estimation, which helps virtual props cast accurate shadows and otherwise fit in with their surroundings. Google is also showcasing a few semi-interactive tricks. In a simple demo app, you can set a little Android mascot down in a virtual forest, where it\u2019ll wave when you hold your phone to its face. And in Oz, the Cowardly Lion jumps in fear if you turn the lights out.\nThese are the same kind of capabilities you\u2019ll find in Apple\u2019s ARKit, and I haven\u2019t spent enough time with either platform to rigorously compare their quality. But my controlled demo at Google\u2019s offices was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had with phone-based AR. Objects didn\u2019t jitter when I walked around them, the way I\u2019ve seen even some official ARKit demos do. Props were surprisingly good at popping back into place when I turned the camera away or covered it up, although they couldn\u2019t recover when I lowered the phone and strolled around the conference room.\nNot every Tango app will work with ARCore\nAndroid developers can make augmented reality apps without ARCore, just like iOS developers can do without ARKit, and Google isn\u2019t building for every possible use case. ARCore focuses on detecting planes, not human bodies or facial features, although characters in Oz do respond when the camera sees a face. But Bavor promises that for basic AR tracking, Google has optimized ARCore\u2019s performance more than an outside developer could do. \u201cThe level of quality, the capability, the things it can do, I think will be several levels above the other solutions out there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Nikhil Chandhok / Google\n\n\nGoogle is also trying to make it easy to build for ARCore. Experienced developers can use Java/OpenGL, Unity, and Unreal, and people who are new to 3D design can export ARCore objects from Google\u2019s Tilt Brush VR painting app, or the VR modeling tool Blocks, which Google launched last month. Google is also releasing two experimental, AR-focused builds of Chromium: an Android-based web browser using ARCore, and an iOS-based one based on Apple\u2019s ARKit. I used the Android browser to test a limited version of shopping site Wayfair\u2019s furniture preview tool, which exists as a dedicated app for Tango. It wasn\u2019t quick to load, but once it did, it worked about as smoothly as the app-based equivalent.\nNot all Tango tools adapt so well to ARCore. One app called Constructor, for example, relies on Tango\u2019s dedicated infrared depth-sensing camera to create detailed 3D meshes. \u201cThe environment understanding, as good as it is, is really kind of detecting surfaces to place things on, as opposed to the full 3D structures,\u201d says Bavor. ARCore also has to estimate scale based on the camera feed, while Tango directly measures distance. Things like Wayfair\u2019s furniture previews might be less accurate as a result, although AR director of product Nikhil Chandhok says that \u201cfor all the apps that we think that users want,\u201d the difference is negligible.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do users want? After three years, Tango developers have found some fun and interesting things to do with AR. Bavor says that people \u201clight up\u201d when they place impossible objects into the world, and interior design apps seem like a natural fit. On ARCore, someone even hacked together an app for Google\u2019s complicated espresso machine \u2014 if you hold up your phone, you\u2019ll see instructions like \u201cPut your grounds here\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t touch this piece, it\u2019s hot\u201d overlaid on the camera image.\nBut the best AR apps might not emerge until other Google products advance, too. Combined with more accurate mapping data, Bavor says, ARCore could let your phone point out specific buildings or street corners. He also brings up Google\u2019s recently announced \u201cvisual positioning service,\u201d which is supposed to pinpoint indoor locations within a few centimeters. With VPS, you could conjure an AR prop and come back to it much later, or even leave it for someone else to find.\nGoogle\u2019s augmented reality program could also intersect with its push for visual search. One of the ARCore team\u2019s members is Jon Wiley, formerly the lead designer of Google Search. Now the company\u2019s director of immersive design, he thinks combining ARCore with a visual search tool like Google Lens could pull human-computer interaction more toward the \u201chuman\u201d side of the spectrum. If smartphones are going to follow our thought processes and not the other way around, they need to see the world like we do, Wiley says. \u201cGetting the phone and getting the real world to line up is an incredible technical challenge, but it also offers the opportunity to have a much more intuitive interface.\u201d\nFor an example of how this might work, imagine searching for instructions \u2014 say, a guide to that complicated espresso machine \u2014 by showing Google a picture of the object. Visual search could identify it automatically, and augmented reality could offer an overlay of instructions, instead of a link to a YouTube video or written manual. \u201cWe're working very closely with the Google Lens team, and I see ARCore as one of the many ingredients that will go into experiences like Lens,\u201d says Bavor. \u201cNot anything to announce on that right now, but let's just say we think ARCore is going to make all that stuff more interesting, more powerful, and more useful for people.\u201d\nARCore isn\u2019t just an Android feature, it\u2019s a new way to deliver Google services\nNone of this will be happening in the near future, and we shouldn\u2019t assume too much yet about ARCore\u2019s ultimate reach. Beyond Samsung, Google says it\u2019s working with Huawei, Asus, and LG, among other manufacturers, to reach its 100 million goal this winter. But the company promised a similar laundry list of partnerships for the Daydream VR platform, and several of those phone makers still haven\u2019t delivered. That said, ARCore is in a better position than Daydream. It\u2019s being released right away on the popular Galaxy S8, and you don\u2019t need special accessories to use it. ARCore can also benefit from the work iOS developers have done with ARKit, if it\u2019s easy enough to port their apps to Android.\nFor all the work Google has done on Tango, its biggest opportunity isn\u2019t making Android the most \u201cpowerful\u201d AR platform. It\u2019s growing the entire AR space enough that people are constantly using it with services like Maps and Lens, regardless of operating system. \u201cWe're here to build great products that a lot of people use, and that likely means for those applications, being where the users are. And that includes iOS,\u201d Bavor says. Augmented reality offers an entirely new way of looking at the world \u2014 and no matter what kind of window you\u2019re looking through, Google is designing the tools to interpret what you see.\nUpdate 12:30PM ET: Google tells us that ARCore will run on Pixel phones running Android Nougat, not just the newer Oreo.\n"}
