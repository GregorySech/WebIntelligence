{"title": "The Xbox One X will support 1440p displays", "content": " \nThe Xbox One X is being marketed heavily as a 4K-focused machine, but it turns out that\u2019s not the only way to get greater resolution than 1080p. The One X will eventually have native support for 1440p (2560 x 1440) monitors, as confirmed by Microsoft\u2019s Kevin Gammill on Twitter. Gammill later clarified that 1440p support won't be ready immediately but is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d \n1440p is a popular resolution for high-end gaming monitors, particularly among players who like to prioritize framerate. While it\u2019s unlikely that many developers will specifically target 1440p displays on the Xbox One X, the addition of system-wide 1440p output at least means that you\u2019ll be able to make the most of the native resolution. The One X could theoretically also support variable framerate on FreeSync monitors, although nothing has been announced to that effect.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n4K is the wrong target for Xbox One X and PS4 Pro\n\nThis is in contrast to Sony\u2019s approach with the PlayStation 4 Pro, even though many games with PS4 Pro support are rendered at 1440p for the purposes of upscaling to 4K TVs. The PS4 Pro only supports 1080p or 4K output, and the latter only works with 4K screens. This means that if you play a 4K or 1440p game on a Pro hooked up to a 1440p monitor, it\u2019ll just output 1080p and upscale, which doesn\u2019t look great.\nThe number of people putting Xboxes on desks and plugging them into PC monitors probably isn\u2019t high, but this is a thoughtful move from Microsoft that makes sense for the Xbox One X\u2019s niche. While the One X is still very much positioned around 4K, and lower-resolution displays won\u2019t often use the console\u2019s power in the most efficient way, Microsoft is ensuring that they\u2019ll still see some benefit with 1440p support alongside system-wide supersampling to 1080p.\nUpdate, 2PM ET: Added Kevin Gammill's clarification that 1440p support is still in the works.\n"}
