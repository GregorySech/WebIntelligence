{"title": "VR was sold as an \u2018empathy machine\u2019 \u2014 but some artists are getting sick of it", "content": " \nAt last week\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival, I asked director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) what had inspired her to experiment with virtual reality for The Protectors: Walk in the Ranger\u2019s Shoes, a VR documentary that was included in the 2017 Tribeca Immersive showcase. \u201cI think that the simple answer is empathy,\u201d Bigelow said. \u201cNot that film doesn't create empathy, of course it does,\u201d she continued. But VR, to Bigelow and her co-director Imraan Ismail, offered an intimacy that traditional cinema can\u2019t. It was the perfect way to raise the profile of the real-life rangers who protect endangered elephants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 which was, ultimately, The Protectors\u2019 goal.\nFor the last few years, this idea \u2014 that virtual reality is an \u201cempathy machine,\u201d as many put it \u2014 has been one of the medium\u2019s central tenets. And as The Protectors indicates, the empathy machine is as present as ever at Tribeca. But filmmakers and developers seem increasingly ambivalent of the catch-all term \u2014 and at the festival, the medium\u2019s creators are looking for ways to evolve beyond it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protectors: Walk in the Ranger\u2019s Shoes.\nImage: Tribeca Film Festival\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cempathy machine\u201d likely originated with Roger Ebert, who described film as \u201cthe most powerful empathy machine in all the arts.\u201d But in a 2015 TED Talk, filmmaker Chris Milk claimed the label for virtual reality. Milk\u2019s definition of empathy was broad enough to include his seven-year-old self identifying as Evel Knievel. The works we associate with VR empathy, though, are usually awareness-raising experiences where viewers get a firsthand view of war, sickness, or other forms of suffering. Groundbreaking VR journalist Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a pioneered the form, starting with her 2012 piece Hunger in Los Angeles, which re-created a real incident of a diabetic man collapsing in a food bank line. Milk\u2019s studio Here Be Dragons (formerly Vrse.works) arguably codified the empathy machine genre with Clouds over Sidra, a 2015 award-winning 360-degree video set in a camp for Syrian refugees.\nEmpathy isn\u2019t over, but the term has become a buzzword\nHere Be Dragons produced two films for Tribeca 2017, both of which fit this mold: the aforementioned The Protectors and The Last Goodbye, which re-creates the ruins of a Nazi concentration camp. But studio co-founder and president Patrick Milling-Smith resisted the ubiquitous label. \u201cI never want to hear anybody say \u2018empathy machine\u2019 again,\u201d he confessed in an interview. Milling-Smith hasn\u2019t changed his mind about the underlying idea of VR creating empathy: \u201cIt was so correct,\u201d he said. After two years, though, he thinks the term is becoming overused.\nOthers at the festival took a firmer stance. Unrest reflects filmmaker Jennifer Brea\u2019s firsthand experience being bedridden with chronic fatigue syndrome, the subject of her documentary of the same name. Co-creator Amaury La Burthe, though, denied that the piece is based around provoking empathy. \u201cIt's more about showing this moment with [Brea] and seeing how she overcomes that,\u201d he said. He thinks of his mission as simply creating an experience that feels real. \u201cI don't like this \u2018empathy machine\u2019 thing,\u201d said La Burthe, who finds things like VR refugee documentaries \u201ca bit weird\u201d and ineffective. \u201cFor me it doesn't generate that much empathy. I prefer a very good documentary,\u201d he said. \u201c360 immersion doesn't add that much in this respect.\u201d\n\u201cIf you won't believe someone's pain unless they wrap an expensive 360 video around you, then perhaps you don't actually care about their pain.\u201d\nThis kind of ambivalence extends far beyond Tribeca. Last month, game developer Robert Yang published a diatribe against the term \u201cempathy machine,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe illusion of empathy\u201d was the best that these experiences could offer. \u201cIf you won't believe someone's pain unless they wrap an expensive 360 video around you, then perhaps you don't actually care about their pain,\u201d he wrote. An earlier New Inquiry essay by Kathryn Hamilton also lambasted Clouds over Sidra, which Hamilton said \u201cinvites the user into a visual and aural immersion, without the user facing any of the consequences of being immersed in that space.\u201d\nEven if we assume VR can create true empathy, that empathy can be easily misused or exploited. That premise underlies the Tribeca VR film Extravaganza, which is set inside a retro-futuristic headset that plays animatronic skits. In Extravaganza, a media executive tries out the headset, which he\u2019s been told is an \u201cempathy machine.\u201d But all it plays are puppet shows full of (literally) balloon-breasted women and crude racial stereotypes, who are slaughtered \u2014 to the man\u2019s amusement \u2014 by a monocled 19th century explorer. According to creator Ethan Shaftel, it critiques the way that a new medium can reproduce old forms of bigotry. \u201cThis puppet show was clearly made for people like him, by people like him, and it\u2019s certainly not making the world any better,\u201d said Shaftel. The technology might be new, but \u201cthis show\u2019s already been made and programmed, and will never change.\u201d\n\u201cYou bring your \u2018you-ness\u2019 with you in a way that is very different than cinema.\u201d\nShaftel does believe that VR creates empathy, but he thinks that in some ways, it\u2019s actually worse at inspiring it than traditional film. \u201cVR is an immersion machine. It can and does transport you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in many ways, you bring your \u2018you-ness\u2019 with you in a way that is very different than cinema.\u201d Film viewers might have a powerful response to a close-up of an emotional character. In VR, people might be more focused on their own feeling of presence. \u201cCreating the powerful empathy that cinema routinely achieves \u2014 from movies to reality shows, to Super Bowl commercials \u2014 is something that current VR technique does not do well.\u201d It will take time, he thinks, for VR filmmakers to figure out the medium\u2019s true strengths.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that everyone at Tribeca thinks the idea of an empathy machine is obsolete. Zohar Kfir, who used the term in reference to her interactive sexual assault documentary Testimony, believes that VR has clear, pragmatic emotional advantages. \u201cPutting a headset on is a commitment to watch something. It's not like scrolling [through] a YouTube video,\u201d she said at the festival. \u201cWhen you're by yourself and you're watching something, it's ground zero for intimacy.\u201d So ultimately, has the phrase been helpful? \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony.\nImage: Tribeca Film Festival\n\n\nAnd one Tribeca installation was literally created as part of an empathy experiment: Becoming Homeless, from Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab. In the game-like Becoming Homeless, participants must select objects that they\u2019ll sell to make rent. When the money runs out, they sit on a bus, forced to split their attention between keeping an eye on their backpack and watching a potential harasser \u2014 if they look away from the bag, it starts sliding away, but if they don\u2019t keep watching the man, he starts approaching. It underlines mundane but chronic problems that may be invisible to people who haven\u2019t faced homelessness.\n\u201cIt's ground zero for intimacy.\u201d\nIn the accompanying study, whose results are currently undergoing review, researchers followed up Being Homeless with a series of questions. They asked participants about their feelings toward homeless people, in addition to measuring concrete behaviors like a willingness to sign an affordable housing petition. Participants\u2019 responses provided new data points for the Virtual Human Interaction Lab\u2019s substantial body of research. \u201cWe've been studying empathy in VR for a number of years now,\u201d said project manager Elise Ogle at Tribeca. In limited, short-term studies, the lab has found that VR can prompt people to better plan for the future or be more environmentally conscious. With Becoming Homeless, the team also hopes to find out if positive effects persist after eight weeks \u2014 a length of time far longer than their previous studies have measured.\nOne of the biggest takeaways from Stanford\u2019s research, though, is that experiences need a lot of fine-tuning to make a difference. \u201cThe experience and context matters,\u201d said lab manager Tobin Asher. \u201cThe reason we do so many iterations of a lot of these pieces is because subtle things can make a difference.\u201d This can mean different levels of interactivity, or variables like whether someone\u2019s virtual hands match the skin tone of their real ones \u2014 which, in turn, raises its own questions about people\u2019s ability to put themselves in others\u2019 shoes. As for the other things they\u2019ve learned about VR and empathy? \u201cWe've learned that a lot of people have listened to Chris Milk's TED Talk,\u201d Ogle said wryly.\nIt\u2019s possible that as virtual reality diversifies, the empathy genre will feel more like one possibility among many. One Tribeca Immersive installation, NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism, imagines a utopian future for marginalized people instead of a dark present. Fiction was once rare in VR cinema, but a substantial number of this year\u2019s selections were short narrative films whose main purpose wasn\u2019t evoking a moment of socially conscious connection. And it\u2019s possible that at a time when positive visions of the world feel difficult to find, more virtual reality will move toward seeking hope. As Milling-Smith muses: \u201cMaybe we need more optimistic VR right now, for the next four years.\u201d\n"}
