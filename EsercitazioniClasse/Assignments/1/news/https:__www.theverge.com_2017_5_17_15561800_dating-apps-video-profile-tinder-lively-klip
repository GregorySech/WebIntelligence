{"title": "The internet is moving to video, but dating apps choose to arrive fashionably late", "content": " \nThose seeking love aren\u2019t want for options \u2014 at least when it comes to dating apps. Dozens of services now let users connect with others based on religion, sexuality, race, hobbies, specific sexual interests, or even just a love of bacon. Dating apps, eager to differentiate themselves, are quick to try new trends. But when it comes to the biggest push in social media \u2014 video \u2014 options are curiously lacking.\nThe majority of the most popular dating apps \u2014 like Tinder, Happn, and Hinge \u2014 don\u2019t allow users to share or upload videos. Even newer apps, like Hater or Wingman, stick to photos. The limitation is at odds with the flood of video onto Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, following the rise in popularity of Snapchat.\nThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily a general aversion to video dating, which has been around longer than smartphones and the internet. Video-dating services enjoyed popularity in the \u201880s, when suitors would record personal profiles on VHS tapes to be sorted and distributed to potential matches by dating services. \nClips of these cringe-worthy videos exist online today, where subjects speak directly into a camera about who they are and what they\u2019re looking for. \u201cI\u2019m an executive by day and a wild man by night,\u201d says one in a video cut together by The Found Footage Festival. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the goddess,\u201d waxes another, rose in hand. \u201cAre you the goddess? Who is the goddess? The goddess is the woman, is a woman, is any woman, is all women.\u201d The archive alone offers one answer to why video dating apps haven\u2019t taken off: do we want our pining to be public?\n\u201cYou\u2019re showing your flaws, your personality, the real you\u201d\nThat hasn\u2019t deterred investors and entrepreneurs. Startups have tried for decades to update video dating for modern audiences. The most prolific botched video-dating platform is hidden in plain sight. When Jawed Karim co-founded YouTube, it wasn\u2019t meant to be a space for internet personalities and funny cat videos. It was a dating site. The slogan: \u201cTune in, Hook up.\u201d These days, YouTube is only interested in the former.\nAs dating services have moved on to smartphones, many developers have tried methods for incorporating video: speed dating, recorded clips, direct video chatting. Earlier this year, TechCrunch reported that popular dating app Bumble was adding 10-second clips to its service, though it\u2019s yet to be made available. But broadly, video hasn\u2019t become a core feature for dating\u2019s most popular services. \n\u201cI\u2019ll admit it: video is scary,\u201d says Behzad Behrouzi, who oversees product operations at Lively, a video-based dating app. \u201cYou\u2019re showing off so much more of yourself than if you just posted a selfie. You\u2019re showing your flaws, your personality, the real you \u2014 and that can be terrifying.\u201d\nLively launched in 2016 under the umbrella of Zoosk, an online dating site and mobile app; Behrouzi also acts as the company\u2019s senior vice president of product. In March, Lively introduced Quickies, a Snapchat-like feature that allows users to record short clips of themselves with frames and filters. Behrouzi says the company wants to people to have fun.  \nThe frames have more purpose than beautifying a self-portrait. Instead of posing stoically or fretting over what selfies to use in a profile, the app tries to encourage users to be performative with frames like \u201cMy Donald Trump impression.\u201d It\u2019s not the first thing that comes to mind for friendly and flirty, but it is, at the very least, a conversation starter. Why that face? What do you think of President Trump?\nBehrouzi calls video dating largely uncharted territory, but points to Snapchat\u2019s success as an admirable model. \u201cYou\u2019re sending videos to friends,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Lively, you\u2019re posting/sending videos to people you don\u2019t know, which can be intimidating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying safe online\nVideo has the potential to make the vetting process easier, says Marcel Cafferata, creator of 2012 video app Video Date. Cafferata says that the downside to apps like Tinder is that photos only offer a static look at that person. \u201cYou don't know if their voice is terrible, you don't know if they're readable,\u201d he says. \nVideo can also act as a shield against the unknown. What do many online daters need to be wary of? Dodging the infamous trap of catfishing: people posing as someone else online. The general idea has long been a peril of the internet, but the phrase itself comes from a 2010 documentary Catfish. The film is a cautionary tale of a man developing a relationship with a woman online who\u2019s not who she says she is. \nIn practice, confirming that people are who they say they are is something online spaces have already tackled in a variety of ways. Reddit\u2019s popular AMA feature, for example, will often feature photos of celebrity posters holding up dated, handwritten signs. Services like Twitter use a stringent verification process, for those they see fit to award the notorious blue checkmark. Many dating apps already require connecting to Facebook \u2014 which, in recent years, has cracked down on fake accounts \u2014 to semi-verify someone\u2019s ID. \nBut video may allow for an added layer of identity verification. Cafferata says that catfishing was the impetus behind Video Date. \u201cI wanted to eliminate catfishing,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cI wanted to eliminate the fake profiles. I wanted to get people face-to-face so they can communicate, like a FaceTime, like Skype.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a trade-off: an awkward first FaceTime for the reassurance of confirming a suitors identity before your meet in person.\nThe complexities of video\nAs the old saying goes, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Instamour co-founder Jason Sherman and several other dating app creators recite this line of thinking to The Verge. Popular dating apps are managing just fine with ads, in-app purchase models, and subscription-based services. Implementing video requires time and money for development, QAing, and teaching users how to understand it. There\u2019s no motivation to add a huge, costly feature as long as people are using their service. \nEven if a business has the funds and capability to add videos to its service, there\u2019s the concern of bad behavior, if not outright harassment by users. Harassment remains a problem for dating services. Social accounts like Bye Felipe have cataloged hundreds of users (primarily men) sending crude or threatening messages online and through dating apps. If an unwanted dick pic is gross, imagine the nightmare possibilities of video. \nThese dating companies have yet to find a silver bullet for video moderation, and so the responsibility often falls onto users.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlip, like Instamour and so many others, uses moderation and user reports to remove inappropriate content from its dating platform. Founder Niko Porkka says the company doesn\u2019t moderate klipping \u2014 the service\u2019s one-on-one video interactions between users \u2014 out of privacy protection. The feature does allow users to report inappropriate behavior. Other apps, like Zoosk\u2019s Lively app, discourage users from posting inappropriate content by linking it to their public identity. Users need a Facebook profile to use Lively, which means any combination of name, age, job, schools attended, and so on are displayed on someone\u2019s profile. \nCafferata says Video Date suffered from moderation issues as well. He tried to implement facial recognition and use flagging to prevent users from uploading inappropriate content, but people still found a way around it. \"No matter how creative I was to try and develop a way to eliminate or prevent, there was always a way someone was able to get around it or get into it and do that,\u201d he says. \u201cI did unfortunately have tons of nudity, and I had to, aside from the automatic elimination, I had to manually eliminate. It was more of the guys. The guys ruin it all, not the girls. The guys are the worst.\u201d\nThe future of mobile dating\nCafferata claims he sold Video Date three years ago to a well-known basketball player, though the site\u2019s contact hub still redirects to Cafferata\u2019s email. Maintaining it became too overwhelming for him. The service hasn\u2019t updated its site or social channels in years. \"It was a timing thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to keep it, but the financial gain of it, I wasn't really gaining a lot at that point.\u201d\nSince Cafferata stopped running Video Date, he says the mobile dating scene has changed. He credits its popularity to Tinder, which he believes cracked the code with gamification and speed. \"I think video chat, that would actually blow up and do very well,\u201d he says of modern video dating. \u201cI think today it would be 100 percent very popular, but they have to make it the right way that brings people to video chat, but also eventually want to meet.\u201d\nthe lines between dating apps and social apps will start to blur\nFor now, video integration remains a risky and expensive novelty for dating services. But a year from now, it might be the new normal. When asked about the possibilities of video integration, a Tinder spokesperson declined to comment directly, but said it\u2019s always interested in new ways to improve its experience. \nClaire Certain, Happn\u2019s head of Global Communications & Media, says the company is currently exploring augmented reality. Video isn\u2019t something its users ask for, Certain says, and it would require a lot of moderation. \u201cBut given mobile consumption in the field of video, we are considering it, with great care,\u201d she says, \u201cto ensure that the content shared in-app fully complies with our engagement towards our users.\u201d \nBrendan Alper, creator of Hater, sees video becoming more prominent in years to come. People don\u2019t know if they want it yet, but once they\u2019ve got it, he thinks there\u2019s no going back. \u201cI think the lines between dating apps and social apps will start to blur, and I think video will play a big role in this happening,\u201d Alper says.\n\u201cObviously social apps have embraced video, and I think it's inevitable that dating apps will, too. The only question is when, not if.\u201d\nCorrection: Claire Certain is the head of Global Communications & Media at Happn. This article originally identified her as part of Tinder as well. \n"}
