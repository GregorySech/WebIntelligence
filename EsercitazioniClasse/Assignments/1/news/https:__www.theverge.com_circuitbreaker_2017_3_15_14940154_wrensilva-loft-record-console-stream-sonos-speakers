{"title": "Wrensilva\u2019s new record console will stream music to your Sonos speakers", "content": " \nWrensilva is back with its latest record console, as first noted by Highsnobiety, and this time it comes with a notably smaller footprint. The Wrensilva Loft is the company\u2019s newest creation, coming in at less than half the size of previous consoles built by Wrensilva.\nConstructed out of North American walnut, the Loft features a Wrensilva amp pushing 300 watts per channel, a fully decoupled belt-driven turntable, a 3.5mm jack, and Sonos compatibility, allowing users to stream their records directly to the speaker system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Wrensilva\n\n\nFor users who don\u2019t have Sonos, Wrensilva is also selling the Loft in a package with its two-way bass reflex Monitor speakers \u2014 for an additional $1,500, of course. The Wrensilva Loft will cost you $2,999 by itself, or $4,498 with the two Monitor speakers and speaker stands. You can purchase the record console today from Wrensilva\u2019s website.\n"}
