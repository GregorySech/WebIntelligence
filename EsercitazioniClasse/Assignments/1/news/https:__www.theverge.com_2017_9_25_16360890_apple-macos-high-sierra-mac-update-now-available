{"title": "Apple\u2019s macOS High Sierra update is now available", "content": " \nThe latest big update to Apple\u2019s desktop operating system, macOS High Sierra, has just been released as a free upgrade for users. It\u2019s available now in the Mac App Store. All Macs from 2010 and later are compatible with the update, and some MacBooks and iMacs released as far back as 2009 can also run it. For a thorough look at all the new features that make up High Sierra, definitely read The Verge review.\nAfter installing this update, you won\u2019t notice many significant outward changes or redesigns, but the Mac\u2019s core software foundation is in fact changing rather drastically. MacOS High Sierra includes a new, modernized file system \u2014 Apple File System (APFS) \u2014 and support for more efficient photo (HEIF) and video (HEVC) standards. HEVC, also known as H.265, is designed to efficiently handle 4K video without eating up too much storage on your Mac. \nThere are some user-facing updates, though; the Photos app now has an expanded and more powerful set of editing tools. Apple has declared war on annoying autoplay videos in the latest version of its Safari browser, and the company is also making it much more difficult for advertisers to track Mac users around the web with a new feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention. Siri has a new, more natural voice (just like in iOS 11), and Notes also gets some new functionality with pinned notes.\n"}
