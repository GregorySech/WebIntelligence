{"title": "Anthony Levandowski, Uber\u2019s fired self-driving car engineer, founded his own church", "content": " \nAnthony Levandowski is many things to many different people: brilliant engineer, serial entrepreneur, ruthless businessman, trade secret thief. (That last one is just alleged.) But now, thanks to an extensive profile in Backchannel, we can add another category to Levandowski\u2019s long r\u00e9sum\u00e9: church founder. \nLevandowski, the multimillionaire who is at the center of the ongoing legal battle between Alphabet and Uber over autonomous driving technology, recently filed paperwork to create a religious organization called Way of the Future. According to Wired, the purpose is to \u201cdevelop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cdevelop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence\u201d\nNaturally, Levandowski is a big believer in the Singularity, that moment in the future where AI surpasses human intelligence, abruptly triggering runaway technological growth. After all, he was instrumental in the development and rollout of autonomous vehicles for both Google (now Waymo) and Uber. It\u2019s that involvement that now has him facing possible criminal charges, after Waymo accused Uber of stealing its self-driving secrets. \nWay of the Future has not filed any forms with the IRS to qualify as a tax-exempt religious organization, but it has submitted documents with California that reveal Levandowski as the group\u2019s CEO and president, and that it aims \u201cthrough understanding and worship of the Godhead, [to] contribute to the betterment of society.\u201d\nSome religious scholars see artificial intelligence as a threat to humanity. Elon Musk has been especially vocal lately, famously comparing work on AI to \u201csummoning the demon,\u201d and warning time and time again that the technology poses an existential risk to humanity. I\u2019m sure a few sermons from Father Anthony from the Way of the Future would set Brother Elon on the right path. \n"}
