{"title": "Amazon\u2019s Echo Look does more for Amazon than it does for your style", "content": " \nOver the past couple of years, Amazon\u2019s connected devices have slowly made their way into the home with increasing levels of boldness and oddity. They range from a buy-me-now button to a barcode-scanning wand to a virtual assistant in tubular casing. At one time not long ago, the Amazon stuff in your home probably consisted of books and trinkets and cardboard boxes... all of those boxes. Now, it\u2019s all \u201csmart\u201d stuff, and no one is smarter for it all than Amazon. \nUsing these devices generally means you have not only purchased something from Amazon, but also that Amazon can now gain even deeper knowledge about the things you\u2019re interested in, the things you find intriguing enough to buy, and the things you\u2019re likely to go back and buy again and again. In a lot of ways these virtual assistants are as much about assisting the companies that make them as they are about helping you. \nAmazon\u2019s new Echo Look camera is no exception. This $200 hands-free camera doubles as a speaker and runs Alexa, Amazon\u2019s popular voice-controlled assistant. You can talk to it and ask it for the news and ask it to set timers and ask to play music and do almost all the things you would do with Alexa on another Echo device. But its main feature is its ability to take hands-free, floor-length photos of you \u2014 specifically of your clothing, which Amazon then compares to photos of other outfits you\u2019ve stored in the compatible mobile app. Also, the app will show you similar clothing items that you can buy. From Amazon. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, since smartphones took over the developed world, there have been several apps that help you keep track of outfits and dole out style advice. You can also, of course, send photos to friends from a dressing room or from the comfort of your own home and get a second opinion pretty much immediately. But Amazon is taking a fully integrated approach: buy our hardware, use our software, and reap the benefits of our massive e-commerce site and our \u201cyou might also like this\u201d algorithms. \nThe result is a slightly bizarre gadget that works as promised: it takes photos of your outfits, and the photos are nice. But in its first iteration, it serves to do more for Amazon than it does for you. The gadget subsists on the notion that you really don\u2019t know which outfit looks better on you \u2014 and hey, sometimes you really don\u2019t \u2014 but it also has no contextual information for where or what event you\u2019re wearing your outfit to, which is often a big part of outfit indecision. \nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting this isn\u2019t widely available yet. Amazon is rolling out the Echo Look on a per-invitation basis. But thanks to another e-commerce site (cough eBay), I\u2019ve had the Echo Look inside my apartment for a few weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Echo Look camera is a small, phallic-shaped piece of hardware with a flat panel on the front. Nested in its front is one visible camera lens surrounded by four small LED lights. I also happened to see a torn-down version of the Look, which revealed that the front-facing lens isn\u2019t the only camera sensor. There\u2019s also a depth sensor and what appears to be an illuminator hidden behind the opaque front panel. \nThe Echo Look is a voice-controlled camera that snaps a photo of you, then sends it to an app for immediate judgement\nThere\u2019s a far-field, four-microphone array at the top of the Echo Look, fewer mics than the seven-microphone array in the tall Echo and Echo Dot puck. The reduction in microphones is less of an issue, though, than the Echo Look\u2019s speaker, which is positioned in the back. To call this thing a \u201cspeaker\u201d is being generous. And, because certain tasks won\u2019t sync up across different Echo devices, I often found myself talking to my kitchen Echo only to hear the Echo Look responding from the living room, or vice versa. (Amazon\u2019s Echo devices have a feature called Echo Spatial Perception that\u2019s supposed to determine which device is closest to you and respond appropriately, but a few of us at The Verge have found it doesn\u2019t always work.) \nThe Look rests on a small, screw-in stand that comes in the packaging, along with a wall mount if you decide to go that route. You\u2019re supposed to position the camera at shoulder height, because that gives the Look the best perspective on your whole outfit. If you\u2019re already an outfit-chronicler, this is one of the best qualities of this gadget: it does it for you, hands-free, full-length. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the marketing video for this product, women wear cute scarves and pencil skirts and sweaters with eyes on them, and stand in front of makeshift closets in airy bedrooms with hardwood floors. The unsaid message is there: you\u2019re supposed to put this camera in the bedroom. The idea of having an internet-connected camera in my bedroom was met with a fast \u201cNope\u201d in my house, so my Echo Look ended up crammed on a bookshelf in the living room. \n\u201cAlexa, take a photo,\u201d you say to the Look while you pose in front of it. A blue ring of light blinks at you three times, and then the four LEDs flash so brightly they might freak out a pet. I know because they freaked out my cat. You can also ask the camera to take a video, which gives you six seconds to spin or twirl or shift hands on hips \u2014 whatever you need to do to see all angles of the outfit you\u2019re oh-so-unsure about. The photos tend to be flattering, with an exaggerated depth effect applied to them, making you and your outfit stand out. \nThese photos are sent wirelessly to a compatible mobile app, the Echo Look app. This is the first time Amazon has created a standalone app for one of its Echo devices; most times, you manage your \u201cAlexa\u201d products from the Amazon Alexa app. But the Echo Look app is where the style comparison feature lives, where you can compare two different outfits and find out which one is \u201cbetter,\u201d where you can see other clothing items to buy, and where you\u2019ll try for the life of you to figure out what it is that makes one outfit better than the other. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past few weeks I\u2019ve taken more than 40 photos of myself wearing different outfits, chronicling everything from pajamas to formal wear to a wetsuit. (This doesn\u2019t include the many extraneous Echo Look photos we took during the photo and video shoot for this review.) And I\u2019ve used the comparison feature, called Style Check, around 20 times. The app usually only takes about a minute to review two photos and tell you which one is worthy of a yellow check mark. And for what it\u2019s worth, the two photos have to be pics of the same person. The app knows if you try to compare two different people, rather than different outfits. \nI couldn\u2019t figure out what made the Look decide which outfit was better than another\nI tried looking for patterns in the app\u2019s preferences, and the only one I could say with confidence is that in general, better-fitting clothes were rated higher. One example: I compared two plain white slogan T-shirts with different slogans. (Amazon says the app isn\u2019t judging based on content written on clothing.) One T-shirt fits tighter than the other, and that one got the vote. Same with workout clothes: a fitted workout zip-up scored better than my loose-fitting, beat-up sweatshirt. \nBut that wasn\u2019t always consistent. A long, flowing, floral dress scored better than a tailored, tangerine-colored knee-length dress. Style Check wasn\u2019t necessarily about more revealing outfits, either: I dug out a tube top I haven\u2019t worn in good conscience in approximately 10 years, and compared that to a T-shirt. The T-shirt won. Time to retire the tube top. \nOther times, I was convinced that Amazon doesn\u2019t like jackets. But then I would put on a different kind of jacket or blazer, and that outfit would get the thumbs-up. It\u2019s also possible that the app was factoring in weather, one of the external pieces of information it pulls in.  \nAmazon says the Style Check feature takes into account fit, color, styling, and current trends. It wouldn\u2019t say directly that it factors in gender; a company spokesperson merely pointed out to me that a customer can select their preferred style as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d when they sign up.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just the machine learning algorithms that are determining which outfit you should wear: Amazon has hired \u201cfashion specialists\u201d to work on this feature as well, although it wouldn\u2019t say whether those humans are waiting at the ready for your photo submissions and rushing to get a response to customers within one minute. Customers themselves can also add in their vote for different outfits in the app, which \u2014 here we go again \u2014 helps Amazon learn more about you so it can improve its service.\nThe shopping element of the app is a little weak. It\u2019s also buried in the taxonomy of the app, forcing you to click on one of your Echo Look photos, then go to Details, then tap on Similar Items, and from there, go to Amazon\u2019s main app. I wasn\u2019t really expecting spot-on clothing recommendations from Amazon just yet, try as it might to establish itself in the fashion world. But it never recommended shoes or accessories (which I am most likely to buy from Amazon), and it had a tendency to suggest I shop for other items in a similar color pattern (if I already have a blue blouse I don\u2019t need another blue blouse). It also once suggested I might be interested in a similar top from the Junior\u2019s department even though I haven\u2019t shopped in that section of a store in a very long time.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the granular details of the Echo Look hardware, the faux depth-of-field on the photos, or the outfits the app thinks I should wear, is the simple premise that Amazon thinks you don\u2019t know what you want to wear. Which, on some level, is true for me: I am one of those people who regularly feels undecided about what to wear, which I blame on having spent my most formative years in a uniform of some sort. As I write this review, I have just finished ironing an entire suitcase filled with unnecessary items because I am generally nervous about traveling without the Right Thing to Wear.\nAmazon has the potential to really get the context of fashion, but it\u2019s just not there yet\nI\u2019m finding as I get older, however, that what I\u2019m wearing is less about what\u2019s cool right now right this minute and more about practicality. Is this item appropriate for a funeral? Is this too casual for an interview, or too precious for a casual coffee? Am I going to be freezing at a friend\u2019s wedding if I wear this? If the answer is yes: why are you not recommending I buy a jacket or shawl for that? Is this something that someone half my age would wear? (Yes, if it\u2019s in the Juniors department.) I\u2019m looking for more context, basically. Amazon, perhaps more than any e-commerce company, has the ability to do this. Amazon says this is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d with the Echo Look and that it will get smarter over time, but the Echo Look app is just not there yet. \nThere\u2019s also the undeniable truth that a lot of people do know what they like to wear, regardless of gender, age, weather, current trends, or what anyone else has to say. Clothes are personal. Voting in an app may help it learn over time, but it still doesn\u2019t really know you. Only you know that your beat-up sweatshirt, the one that Echo Look nixed, makes you feel good about the fact that you paid your way through grad school. Only you know that you consider that lime green thing to be your lucky jacket, and that you like to wear it on reporting trips, algorithms be damned. Only you know you\u2019re holding onto that summer dress that no longer fits the same because you wore it on a first date that lasted five years. Only you can truly know the clothes you actually want to walk out the door wearing, is what I\u2019m saying.\nThe robots, they can only do so much. \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nVerge Score\n\n\nAmazon Echo Look\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nTakes hands-free photos\nWorks with Alexa\nAnother portal to Amazon shopping\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nOne-trick pony\nWeak speaker\nStyle app needs work\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $199.99 from Amazon\n\n\n\n\n"}
