{"title": "Amazon reportedly working on proper Android \u2018Ice\u2019 smartphones with Google\u2019s apps", "content": " \nAmazon might be taking another shot at building its own smartphones, according to a new report from NDTV\u2019s Gadget 360. And unlike the company\u2019s failed Fire Phone, the new smartphones \u2014 allegedly branded \u201cIce\u201d \u2014 would have access to the full line of Google services and apps, including the Play Store.\nThe report notes that the Ice line would be targeted at emerging markets like India, instead of the more US-facing focus of the original Fire Phone. As such, the rumored specs for one of the Ice phones fall in line with that goal: a screen between 5.2 and 5.5 inches, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a Snapdragon 435 processor. Gadget 360 claims that this specific model would retail for roughly $93 at launch, although that price could change before launch. \nThe Ice phone reportedly doesn\u2019t have Alexa support (for now)\nPer Gadget 360\u2019s source, the Ice phone doesn\u2019t have Alexa support, but, like the price, details aren\u2019t finalized which means software, too, could change in the future. \nThe original Fire Phone was a failure for a multitude of reasons, including a focus on gimmicky features, an expensive price tag, exclusivity to AT&T, and a bizarre operating system. It sold extremely poorly, even with Amazon slashing prices only weeks after launch. But perhaps the biggest failure was the dearth of apps by not using Google Mobile Services, in essence leaving customers with a confusingly skinned Android phone that didn\u2019t really run any Android apps. It sounds like Amazon is taking a different approach with the Ice line, by embracing Google\u2019s services and targeting a different slice of the smartphone market than the Apple-and-Samsung-dominated high-end segment.\nIf the Ice rumors are true, Amazon could have a big opportunity in emerging market places. Google has made no secret of its desire to put Android phones in the hands of \u201cthe next billion users\u201d with initiatives like Android Go and Android One; an Amazon hardware push would certainly go a long way toward getting Google there, while also boosting Amazon\u2019s own user base of its own products. \n"}
