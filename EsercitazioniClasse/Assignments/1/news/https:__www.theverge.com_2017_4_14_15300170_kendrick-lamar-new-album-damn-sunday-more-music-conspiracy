{"title": "Kendrick Lamar is releasing another album on Sunday, according to internet sleuths", "content": " \n\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s new album Damn. dropped last night. Anticipation was high, and Kendrick\u2019s fans reacted to the album the way the internet has taught them to: by dissecting it for clues. Clues about what?, you, a person who is merely content to have this album, might ask. Clues about another album, the internet would respond. According to a theory floating around and rapidly growing, Lamar is going to release another album this Sunday, and it\u2019s called Nation.\nLet\u2019s back up. The theory seems to have started a few days ago with a thread in the subreddit r/Kendrick Lamar. The pervading theory is supported by the fact that today is Good Friday (a day that marks the crucifixion of Jesus in Christianity) and two days from now is Easter Sunday (a day that celebrates his resurrection from the dead). Damn + Nation = Damnation. \nAs with all internet conspiracy theories, the clues don\u2019t stop there, but they do get much stranger. For example, if you combine the letters in the Damn tracklist that appear against a white wall on the album\u2019s back cover, they make an anagram for \u201cEarth led 2 death.\u201d Others have speculated it\u2019s actually an anagram for \u201cDeath 2 the leader,\u201d but there aren\u2019t enough E\u2019s for that to work. And on the Damn album cover, the \u201cM\u201d hangs over Kendrick\u2019s head in a way that, if you squint, could look like devil horns. If you imagine similar art for an album called Nation, the \u201cO\u201d could look like a halo. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother \u201cclue\u201d is a line from \u201cThe Heart Part IV,\u201d a one-off single that Lamar released at the end of March: \u201cI said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back / 'Nother classic, right back / My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack / With TOC, you see the flames / In my E-Y-E's; it's not a game.\u201d \nInternet sleuths have decided that \u201cTOC\u201d stands for \u201cThe Other Color.\u201d The first track on Damn is called \u201cBlood,\u201d and the album\u2019s title appears in red. In this case, the other color would be blue (which some have pointed out could be a reference to Crip gang members). Last night, Kendrick changed his Spotify profile picture from one where he\u2019s standing in front of a red wall, to one where he\u2019s standing in front of a blue wall.\nTo top it all off, the idea that another new Kendrick album does exist somewhere was sneakily confirmed by Sounwave, an in-house producer for Kendrick\u2019s label TDE who produced several tracks on Damn.\n\n\nBut what if I told you... that's not the official version..\u2014 Sounwave (@SounwaveTDE) April 14, 2017\n\n\n\nShortly after that, Sounwave also tweeted a photo of Morpheus from The Matrix, who, if you\u2019ve never seen the movie, says this line: \u201cYou take the blue pill \u2014 the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill \u2014 you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\u201d\n\n\n4|14|17 pic.twitter.com/IGXPG21iI1\u2014 Sounwave (@SounwaveTDE) April 14, 2017\n\n\n\nThe rabbit hole does go deep, and it\u2019s easy to see how fans could keep looking for more. Even Kendrick seems to have planted some clues in the album. Damn is stuttered with references to Christianity, exploring ideas like immaculate conception, prayer, and the apocalypse, alongside stories of major moments in Kendrick\u2019s life. Then there\u2019s the fact that the album\u2019s first track, \u201cBlood,\u201d ends with a gunshot that seems to signify his death. Its final track, \u201cDuckworth,\u201d also features a gunshot, followed by audio played in reverse. \nAs KerryGD said on Reddit, \u201cToo real to be fake now.\u201d \n"}
