{"title": "The Cary42 is a gorgeous wooden arcade box for the extremely wealthy", "content": " \nWe\u2019ve covered Swedish designer Love Hult\u00e9n\u2019s magnificent retro gaming machines plenty of times before on The Verge, and his latest effort \u2014 the Cary42 two-player arcade console / attach\u00e9 case \u2014 continues his work of merging handmade wooden hardware with retro gaming. \nThe Cary42 is best described as a larger, upgraded version of Hult\u00e9n\u2019s original R-Kaid-R console, that doubles the controls to allow two players to enjoy classic games together.  It features a 12-inch LCD display, stereo speakers, a 12V DC Power supply, and 16GB of storage preinstalled with 100 games (but its expandable over USB, so you can add as many emulated games as you can fit.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default version of the Cary42 is made out of solid American walnut, and features black and white arcade buttons. But Hult\u00e9n says that he\u2019s happy to discuss further customizations, including custom mother-of-pearl inlay, should you be into that sort of thing. \nSadly though, it\u2019s probably not likely that you\u2019ll have to make that kind of decision, since Hult\u00e9n is only making 50 Cary42s. Oh, and each one costs \u20ac2,599 (roughly $3026.24), not including shipping or VAT, which means that it\u2019ll probably be restricted to the truly wealthy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
