{"title": "Lyft will allow riders to round up their fare to make a charitable donation", "content": " \nIn the coming weeks, Lyft will introduce a new program called Round Up & Donate, which will allow riders to make a charitable contribution when they take a ride with the service. \nRiders will be able to opt into the program, which will automatically round up their fare to the nearest whole dollar. The company announced the program in an ad in The New York Times, stating that \u201cparking your backsides in the back seats across the nation is a way to rebuild our communities around people, not cars.\u201d A blog post aimed at drivers notes that if a fare is $12.75, it will be rounded up to $13, with the extra $0.25 going to a charity. \nRiders will be able to pick from a list of charities\nThe company\u2019s ad explains that users will be able to make a difference with climate change and the \u201cpursuit of equality,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t specify what charities riders will be able to donate to. A spokesperson for Lyft says that users will be able to pick a charity from a provided list in the app, and that it will explore ways for passengers to vote on others for inclusion. The company also said that riders will be able to change the charity that they\u2019re donating to, and will let them opt out of the program at any time. \nA number of stores already allow shoppers to do something similar, and Texas ride-share nonprofit Ride Austin allows riders to do the same to \u201cprovide local charities contributions on an ongoing basis.\u201d Lyft itself isn\u2019t a stranger to charitable giving: earlier this year, the company announced that it would donate 1 million dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union. \n"}
