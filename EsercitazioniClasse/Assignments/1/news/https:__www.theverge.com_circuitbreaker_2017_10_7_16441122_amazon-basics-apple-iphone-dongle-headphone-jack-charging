{"title": "Amazon\u2019s new iPhone dongle is now cheaper than Belkin\u2019s", "content": " \nWith Google\u2019s recent decision to remove the 3.5mm jack on its Pixel 2 devices, we\u2019re going to have to all come to terms with the fact that most phones in the future will not have a standard headphone port. That means buying dongles, and buying dongles means shelling out exorbitant prices for tiny pieces of plastic just to make sure your gadgets work like they used to. Luckily, Amazon\u2019s Basics line has a deal today that makes that slightly less painful for iPhone users, as pointed out by KinjaDeals. \nThe AmazonBasics Lighting to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter is only $30 right now, and it\u2019s looks a lot more thoughtfully designed than the $35 one Apple sells from its official dongle partner Belkin. It\u2019s not a huge price difference, but for the benefits of getting what looks like a better designed piece of hardware \u2014 with the added confidence that it\u2019s coming from Amazon\u2019s official consumer electronics brand \u2014 it\u2019s probably worth eschewing Apple\u2019s partner and grabbing this dongle instead. \n"}
