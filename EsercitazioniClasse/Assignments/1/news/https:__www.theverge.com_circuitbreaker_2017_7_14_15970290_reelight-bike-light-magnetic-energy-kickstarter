{"title": "Reelight\u2019s bike light is powered by magnets, not batteries", "content": " \nA new Kickstarter that promises riders an easily mountable bike light powered only by magnetic energy has successfully been backed by over 1,000 people. Reelight says its CIO LED bike lights are bright, battery free, waterproof, and will flash during your ride \u2014 even when you stop. It\u2019s also anti-theft, as the lights are mounted with a key and the wires are made of coated stainless steel, which is hard to break, the company says.\nThe lights work via magnets that are mounted on the spokes of a bicycle \u2014 when the wheel spins, the magnetic field causes a current that feeds into a small generator integrated into the lights. The lights have a backup system, so even if your bike stops moving, the lights stay on. Unfortunately, the CIO only flashes \u2014 there isn\u2019t an option for the steady glow that is required by some cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy to mount.\nVideo: Reelight\n\n\nReelight was founded in 2003 in Aarhus, Denmark. Reelight\u2019s previous Kickstarter success was for its NEO bike light in 2015. For CIO, Reelight says it has reduced the size of its magnet module while increasing output by approximately six times when compared to its previous version. Another goal for CIO was to \u201creinvent mounting.\u201d The company says its new light can mount on most bikes hassle-free. \u201cWhat used to be two 4.7 inches magnet modules, mounted on each wheel, is now just one small, coin-sized magnet,\u201d the company says on its Kickstarter page.\nAt the time of writing, 452,538 Danish kroner ($69,400) had been pledged toward the 250,000 Danish kroner ($38,400) goal, with 12 days remaining in the campaign. Early-bird pledgers can get a front and rear light set for 278 Danish kroner \u2014 around $43.\nReelight claims its DRL dynamo lights have become the standard in Denmark, with its lights mounted on a third of all bikes there. Reelight is a member of the Cycling Embassy of Denmark and its products are sometimes featured on the site.\n"}
