{"title": "VW to electrify entire 300-car lineup by 2030", "content": " \nThe enormous Volkswagen Group is going to make everything electric in some shape or form by 2030, and that involves a lot of cars.  \nThat\u2019s because the VW Group is made up of a hugely diverse set of brands sold around the world, such as Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, Porsche, and yes, Volkswagen. Offering everything from a 911 to a Tiguan with some sort of electric motor will have a noticeable impact on the number of hybrids and full-EVs available over the next decade or so \u2013 about 300 different cars sold in different markets in total.\nVW Group is made up of a hugely diverse set of brands sold around the world\nThe whole electric endeavor is an $84 billion investment, VW Group CEO Matthias Mueller said Monday in Germany ahead of the Frankfurt Motor Show. Not only does it include the vehicle development, but it also covers a roughly $60 billion plan to build four battery factories that are expected to take more than a bit of inspiration from the Tesla Gigafactory.\nBy 2025, there will be 80 electrified offerings from VW Group, Mueller said, including the already announced production version of the VW I.D. Buzz Concept and a range of dedicated EVs from Audi.  \nMueller says the internal combustion engine isn\u2019t dead, however, and it will be a \u201cbridge\u201d toward a fully electric lineup. But that bridge has to end sometime. France and the United Kingdom have pegged 2040 as the year for gasoline and diesel bans for cars, with China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest car market \u2014 planning a similar move. And then there\u2019s the matter of the load of EVs VW has to sell in California as part of its settlement with the state and federal government after its emissions cheating scandal. \nBut the internal combustion engine isn\u2019t dead at VW \u2014 yet\nBut Mueller\u2019s pledge to the internal combustion engine speaks to the company\u2019s continued exploration into all energy sources. Under leadership of Audi, hydrogen fuel cell research continues and a production car will be offered \u201cone of these days,\u201d he said. \nIn just the last couple of months, Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volvo have all pledged to significantly increase EV and hybrid availability across their vehicle lineups by next decade. While VW is taking more time than those other brands, the impact of their move could be a huge step toward widespread electric vehicle adoption in the near future.\n"}
