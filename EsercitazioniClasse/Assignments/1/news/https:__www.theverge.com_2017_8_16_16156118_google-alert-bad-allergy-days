{"title": "Google can now alert you to bad allergy days", "content": " \nGoogle has introduced a cool new feature for those who, like me, dread pollen and allergy season. Working with The Weather Channel to integrate its pollen index, users can now search for pollen levels and forecast data in specific areas on Google\u2019s mobile site or app. Google says one in five Americans suffer from seasonal allergies, and searches for the word \u201callergies\u201d spike in April and May, before repeating again in September. \nYou can also set up notifications through the Google app for when the pollen count is particularly high. If you want to turn these on, search for \u201cpollen levels\u201d on Google, then tap the \u201cturn on\u201d notification button when a window pops up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Google\n\n\n\n"}
