{"title": "Apple confirms iPhone 8 crackling earpiece issue and says a fix is coming", "content": " \nSome iPhone 8 owners are running into an issue with the phone\u2019s earpiece: when they make a call, the earpiece makes a disruptive \u201ccrackling\u201d or \u201cstatic\u201d sound that disrupts the audio. Dozens of people on the MacRumors forums, Apple\u2019s support forum, and Reddit have reported experiencing the issue. It was also present on one phone owned by a Verge editor.\nApple said in a statement that the issue only comes up in a \u201csmall number\u201d of cases and that the company is working on a software update to fix the problem. \u201cWe are aware of the issue which is affecting customers in a small number of cases,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said. \u201cOur team is at work on a fix, which will be included in an upcoming software release.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what\u2019s causing certain iPhones to be affected. The problem seems to impact both the 8 and 8 Plus, and owners indicate that it\u2019s happening across different carriers and in different parts of the world, too.\nThe crackling only occurs during some phone and Facetime calls, though \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen during every single call, and it doesn\u2019t show up when using the earpiece as a loudspeaker. That suggests it may be a software problem, like Apple is saying, since the hardware itself isn\u2019t consistently displaying the issue.\nYou can get a sense for what the crackling sounds like in the video below \u2014 you\u2019ll probably need to wear headphones to hear it:\n\nThe noise sounds like sharp pops at the very edge of the earpiece. While it wasn\u2019t totally disruptive during the call I heard it on, it did sound a little odd and annoying.\nApple didn\u2019t offer a timeline on when the bug fix would be shipped, but it typically issues multiple updates in the weeks and months after putting out a new phone and operating system.\nThis is the second software fix Apple has promised for one of the new devices it shipped this month. A software issue with the Apple Watch Series 3 caused the Watch to connect to unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks instead of handing off to LTE, leading to some real problems, in our testing, with the device\u2019s flagship feature. The iPhone 8 issue seems to be less of a problem, but it\u2019s still an annoyance for some of the device\u2019s earliest buyers.\nAdditional reporting by Chris Welch. \n"}
