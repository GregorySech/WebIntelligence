{"title": "Twitter\u2019s latest redesign makes the iOS app look more like Android", "content": " \nTwitter is rolling out a significant redesign today for its mobile apps that brings a more unified look to its app for Android, iOS, Tweetdeck, and Twitter Lite. The design, which builds on some changes to the Android app over the past year, moves the profile to a new side navigation tab while freshening up the apps\u2019 typography.\nThe new side tab, which can be accessed by tapping your profile picture on the top of the timeline, lets you access your profile, Moments, and settings. The rest of the app is organized more or less the same, but with a much greater use of white space. In-app icons now have a softer, rounded design, with the reply button changed to a speech bubble, because people thought the previously used arrow-shaped button \u201cmeant delete or go back to a previous page,\u201d Twitter says. If you really thought this please DM me! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn iOS, the new design replaces Twitter\u2019s in-app browser with Safari View Controller, which brings AutoFill, content blocking, and Reader view. You\u2019ll also now have the option of loading stories in the plain-text Reader view by default on articles that support it. \nPersonally, I think the redesign leans a little too hard on white space, but at first blush there\u2019s nothing shocking or offensive about it. The bolder headings are a nice touch. You still can\u2019t edit tweets.\nThe new design is rolling out over the next several days.\n"}
