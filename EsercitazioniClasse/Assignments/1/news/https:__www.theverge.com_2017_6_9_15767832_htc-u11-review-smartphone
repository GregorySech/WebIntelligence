{"title": "HTC U11 review: feeling the squeeze", "content": " \nIt seems that every phone to come out recently has had its own gimmick. Some phones have two cameras, some have super tall screens, while others have snap-on modular accessories or extra displays. Not all of these gimmicks are bad \u2013 a taller screen provides more pixels in less space and dual-camera setups can produce really interesting images \u2013 but they are all ways for phone makers to differentiate their devices when almost every smartphone is basically a flat touchscreen computer.\nHTC\u2019s new U11, available today for $649 unlocked from HTC or $696 from Sprint, the only US carrier offering it, certainly has its own unique trick, though it\u2019s not a particularly good one. But the U11\u2019s gimmick, where you\u2019re expected to squeeze the sides of the phone to do various things, is one that you can completely ignore. For the most part, the rest of the phone \u2013 the screen, the camera, the performance, the design; you know, the parts you actually care about \u2013 is really good and makes it perhaps the best device HTC has made in years.\nThat\u2019s not to say the U11 is perfect \u2013 there are some definite missteps that might give you pause, and it doesn\u2019t have the forward-looking features of its competition. Still, the U11 executes the idea of a traditional smartphone about as well as anyone can ask, provided you are asking for a traditional smartphone.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\n\nBefore I get to the U11\u2019s squeezing trick, let\u2019s cover the basics. The U11 has a 5.5-inch LCD display with Quad HD resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) that\u2019s sharp and colorful and bright enough to be seen easily outside, which is an improvement over last year\u2019s difficult-to-see HTC 10. It has a 16:9 aspect ratio, so it\u2019s not tall and skinny like the screens on the Galaxy S8 or LG G6, and it doesn\u2019t stretch edge-to-edge like those displays do. It\u2019s not as vibrant as Samsung\u2019s AMOLED panels and doesn\u2019t get as eye-searingly bright either, but it is a very nice display and I have no issues with it. It feels familiar because we\u2019ve been looking at this shape of screen in the palm of our hands for a decade now.\nHTC has basically matched Samsung\u2019s expertise with metal and glass\nThat screen is wrapped in a metal and glass body, which is at the same time the best and perhaps the worst part of the U11. A glass back is a relatively new design direction for HTC \u2013 the company started using it this year with the unfortunate U Ultra \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t know that from the way it has been implemented. The curved glass back of the U11 mates to the metal frame with nary a sharp edge and the deep, sapphire blue color of my review unit is a joy to look at. The edges of the front glass over the screen similarly curve down into the frame in an almost seamless manner (though the screen itself is not curved, it is flat). The whole package is wonderfully constructed and premium to a tee. HTC has basically matched Samsung\u2019s expertise with metal and glass designs on its second try, which is no small feat.\nThe downside to this design is that glass is not nearly as hardy as metal, and can be easily scratched or cracked. On top of that, the U11 is a fingerprint and grease magnet, so that beautiful finish gets spoiled almost as soon as you touch it. HTC includes a very basic snap-on plastic case in the box with the U11, which provides more grip and keeps your fingerprints off the glass, but it gets scratched to hell right away and is a poor compromise. On the upside, HTC has finally made its flagship smartphone water resistant; the U11 has the same IP67 water resistance rating as the iPhone 7.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\n\n\nLike Apple, Motorola, and others, HTC has omitted the 3.5mm headphone jack from the U11. The company\u2019s argument for doing this is that it provides more room for other, more important components and produces a sleeker design, but I don\u2019t agree that this compromise is worth it. The U11 is not a small phone, nor is it thin to the point where a headphone jack simply wouldn\u2019t fit. You probably already know whether or not the lack of a headphone jack will be an issue for you personally, so I won\u2019t belabor the point, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to miss it when I got in my car and didn\u2019t have a way to plug the phone into the aux port.\n\n\nHTC U11 Specs\n\n5.5-inch, Quad HD LCD display\n153.9mm x 75.9mm x 7.9mm, 169g\nQualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor\n4GB of RAM, 64GB storage with microSD expansion\nRear camera: 12-megapixel with dual-pixel autofocus, optical stabilization, f/1.7 lens\nFront camera: 16-megapixel, f/2.0 lens\n3,000mAh battery\nIP67 water resistance\nUSB Type-C audio port, Type-C earbuds included\nAndroid 7.1.1 Nougat\nEdge Sense squeezing feature\n$649 unlocked, works with AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon\n$696 from Sprint\nAvailable starting on June 9th\n\n\n\nThe U11 does come with a set of earphones that use the USB Type-C port and they sound surprisingly good for buds that come bundled with a phone. HTC uses the Type-C port\u2019s power delivery to tune the earbuds to your ears for a better sound, and it even offers very basic noise cancellation features. These won\u2019t compare to a proper noise cancelling headset from the likes of Bose, but the U11\u2019s headphones are enjoyable to use on a noisy commute. Frustratingly, though, these headphones won\u2019t work with any other device you might own, such as your laptop or tablet. \nThe U11 also comes with an adapter to use standard headphones with the USB-C port, but that was no help to me in my car when I absent-mindedly left it connected to the headphones I use at home. That\u2019s the trouble with dongles: never there when you need them.\nThe phone\u2019s own speakers (there are two, one at the bottom edge, the other in the earpiece) are loud and clear and can be tuned for video or music depending on what you\u2019re playing. I found them nice for speakerphone calls.\nI\u2019ve been particularly impressed with the U11\u2019s performance; it might be the fastest Android phone I\u2019ve used this side of Google\u2019s own Pixel. Apps open quickly, the interface is very responsive, and scrolling inside of apps is just as fast and fluid as I\u2019d like. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve used an Android flagship that I would call slow, but the U11\u2019s performance has reset my expectations for what fast can feel like. This could be thanks to the U11\u2019s Snapdragon 835 processor, but it also seems to be in part due to a lot of software tuning from HTC.\nI\u2019m less enthused with the U11\u2019s battery life. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad; I\u2019m frequently able to get through a day of medium to heavy use without needing to charge up part way. But it\u2019s not a multi-day marathoner and its stamina just isn\u2019t as impressive as the rest of the phone\u2019s performance. The U11 is the biggest mainstream flagship phone HTC has ever produced (prior models, such as the M9 and HTC 10, had 5 and 5.2-inch screens, respectively), but that increase in size did not bring a notable improvement in battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, the U11\u2019s camera is a winner. The 12-megapixel sensor has an f/1.7, optically stabilized lens and dual-pixel autofocus, and it can take lovely photos in many different lighting conditions. It might not win every head-to-head comparison with a Pixel, S8, or iPhone, and it doesn\u2019t have any of the tricks that phones with two cameras provide, but I didn\u2019t really miss any of that. The U11 just focuses quickly and takes pleasing photos with plenty of detail and accurate colors. The 4K video it captures is also smooth and jitter-free, and it can record 3D sound thanks to its four-microphone array.\nOut of the box, the U11 is running the latest software from Google \u2013 Android 7.1.1 Nougat \u2013 and it has some light customizations from HTC. I think the software is great: it\u2019s fast, easy to use, and not too far away from what Google offers on the Pixel. The U11 even supports app icon shortcuts when you press and hold on an app in its standard launcher.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\n\nThere are not one, but two intelligent assistants on the U11, and soon there will be a third. You already know how Google Assistant works, and you can use \u201cOK Google\u201d any time, even when the screen\u2019s off, to launch it. HTC has its own assistant that tries to give you helpful tips on when to charge your phone, where to go for lunch, and what the weather will be like tomorrow, but most of those are pretty obvious things or already handled by Google\u2019s own Assistant. HTC\u2019s assistant is basically redundant and forgettable. I\u2019m more excited by the forthcoming Amazon Alexa integration, which will allow me to yell \u201cAlexa\u201d at the phone to do things I typically ask an Echo to do \u2014 though that won\u2019t be available until later this summer and I wasn\u2019t able to test it.\nThe U11 is loaded with not one, not two, but three different intelligent assistants\nNow here\u2019s the gimmick: the U11 has pressure sensitive areas on its sides that can respond to a one-handed squeeze. The company calls this \u201cEdge Sense\u201d and it can be configured to launch an app, turn on the flashlight, launch Google Assistant, or do other things with either a short or long squeeze.\nThe idea is that it makes the large U11 slightly easier to use with one hand, but the execution doesn\u2019t live up to that pitch. There are already quicker and more comfortable ways to do many of these tasks and squeezing the sides of the phone never feels normal or intuitive. It\u2019s possible that this might get more interesting in the future \u2013 HTC tells me it has broader plans for it down the line \u2013 but right now it feels half-baked.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\n\nAs I said at the beginning, you can completely ignore the very forgettable Edge Sense feature because you don\u2019t need it to do any of the things you want to use a phone for. You can pick up the U11 and enjoy the display, camera, performance, and build quality without ever thinking about squeezing the sides of it.\nThe U11 is priced right in the premium sector, where companies do differentiate with useful and innovative ideas. It doesn\u2019t have many of the forward-looking features of its competition, but at its base it is a very good smartphone in a very pretty shell. If that\u2019s what you want, and you\u2019re able to get past the lack of a headphone jack and the U11\u2019s attraction to fingerprints, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nVideo by Christian Mazza.\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nVerge Score\n\n\nHTC U11\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nGorgeous design\nImpeccable fit and finish\nBlistering performance\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nLack of a headphone jack is a nuisance\nSqueeze feature is a complete gimmick\nNot offered by 3 of the 4 major US carriers\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $649.00 from Amazon\nBuy for $649.00 from HTC\n\n\n\n \n"}
