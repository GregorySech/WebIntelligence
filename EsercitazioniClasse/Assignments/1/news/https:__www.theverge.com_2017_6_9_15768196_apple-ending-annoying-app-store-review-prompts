{"title": "Apple won\u2019t let apps annoy you with their own review prompts anymore", "content": " \nApple is putting an end to the scourge of review prompts that seemed to pop up inside of some apps every few days. In a change to the App Store rules this week, Apple said it will now enforce hard limits on how review prompts show up and how often users have to see them. The changes were first spotted by 9to5Mac.\nUnder the new rules, developers will no longer be able to display review prompts however and whenever they\u2019d like. Instead, there\u2019ll be two key restrictions that should reduce headaches for everyone: First, apps will be required to use a new Apple-made review prompt, which allows users to leave a rating without exiting an app. That\u2019s a huge convenience that may well get a lot more people to leave ratings. Apple introduced the rating prompt a few months ago, but it\u2019s been optional up until now.\nThis seems like a win-win for developers and users\nThe second restriction is on how often that prompt can show up. An app can only display the prompt three times a year, regardless of how often it\u2019s been updated. And once a user has left a rating, they\u2019ll never see it again. Users also have the option to completely disable app review prompts inside the iOS Settings app, preventing the prompts from annoying them at all.\nThis seems like it should be a win-win for users and developers. People have been annoyed by app review prompts for years, and this update seems to remedy the problem. It may even make people more interested in leaving a review, because it can be done without exiting the app and because it means they\u2019ll be done with the prompt for good. If that results in more reviews \u2014 and reviews from users who aren\u2019t annoyed about switching apps \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing for developers, too.\nPart of the reason developers have their apps show review prompts so often is because  Apple has always reset an app\u2019s rating after every update, even very minor ones. With the redesigned App Store, developers will have the option to change that, so that their app\u2019s ratings are maintained between updates. That\u2019s likely to become a common choice \u2014 for good apps, at least \u2014 since users will only be able to get prompted for a rating once.\nHere\u2019s what the prompt looks like in an app:\n\n\nRequest reviews with iOS 10.3\u2019s SKStoreReviewController: https://t.co/HgugUTrN81 pic.twitter.com/gYjVfJu1Xq\u2014 Xamarin (@xamarinhq) April 20, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
