{"title": "NASA\u2019s eerie space sounds should be the playlist for your Halloween party", "content": " Howling planets, whistling plasma waves, and pelting space rocks: the sounds of space are spooky \u2014 and NASA compiled a list of them to make your Halloween party a little bit more nerdy. The sounds are truly eerie: Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere, the powerful magnetic field that extends millions of miles around the planet, sounds like a light saber from Star Wars, and distantly resembles the noise of frozen lakes here on Earth. Saturn\u2019s radio emissions sound like a robot crying for help in the midst of a wind storm. And the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan resembles the static noise coming off a TV, with a rhythmic sound going on and off in the background. Space is a vacuum \u2014 so it generally doesn\u2019t carry sound waves like air does here on Earth  though some sounds do exist in outer space, we just can\u2019t hear them . But the various probes zooming through our cosmos are capable of capturing radio emissions from space objects. These radio emissions are then converted into sound waves, and the result is the spooky sounds NASA put together into a playlist.Here are some of the sounds, as described by NASA:Juno Captures the \u201cRoar\u201d of Jupiter: NASA's Juno spacecraft has crossed the boundary of Jupiter's immense magnetic field. Juno's Waves instrument recorded the encounter with the bow shock over the course of about two hours on June 24th, 2016.Plasma Waves: Plasma waves, like the roaring ocean surf, create a rhythmic cacophony that \u2014 with the EMFISIS instrument aboard NASA\u2019s Van Allen Probes \u2014 we can hear across space.Sounds of a Comet Encounter: During its February 14th, 2011, flyby of comet Tempel 1, an instrument on the protective shield on NASA's Stardust spacecraft was pelted by dust particles and small rocks, as can be heard in this audio track.You can find the full playlist on SoundCloud. Happy spooky space Halloween!"}
