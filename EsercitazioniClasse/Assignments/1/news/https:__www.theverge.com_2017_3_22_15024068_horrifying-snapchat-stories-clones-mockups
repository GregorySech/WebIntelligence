But it\u2019s not something that needs to be inside every app \u2014 and it looks like Facebook is determined to find that out the hard way.\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen Facebook shamelessly clone Stories inside of nearly all of its big apps. Its clone inside Instagram, Instagram Stories, has actually become a legitimate Snapchat competitor. But its clone inside of Facebook Messenger has prompted complaints of bloating the app, and its clone inside of WhatsApp went so poorly, the team reversed course. It\u2019s looking at adding Stories to the main Facebook app, too.\nThankfully, it\u2019s only Facebook that\u2019s ripping off Snapchat Stories so far. But given how much the rest of the tech industry loves to borrow from Snapchat, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see this go further.\nThe best thing about Conde\u2019s mock-ups is just how plausible they all feel. Apple Music Stories could totally happen. Maps Stories feel like a stretch, but why not? And Stories look great inside of Slack.\nI just hope, it doesn\u2019t get this bad:\n\n\nIntroducing Settings\u2019 Stories!Don\u2019t know where to change the wifi?
