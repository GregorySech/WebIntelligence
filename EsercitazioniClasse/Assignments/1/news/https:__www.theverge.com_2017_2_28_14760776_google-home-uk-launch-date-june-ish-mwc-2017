{"title": "Google Home will launch in the UK before June", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s AI-powered smart speaker, Google Home, is going to launch in the UK before June, according to a report from BBC News. Google exec Rick Osterloh told the publication the rough launch date at Mobile World Congress, going on to say that the search company was uniquely positioned to beat its main rival in the sector, Amazon\u2019s Echo.\n\u201cWe've got so much history with people using our search products and people using voice queries through Android phones... that we're able to much better answer these types of questions,\u201d said Osterloh. \u201cAll this data really helps in us making sure we understand what the user is looking for.\"\nGoogle Home launched in the US last November, powered by Google Assistant. Like the Echo, Home can answer basic questions, carry out simple tasks like setting timers, and also be used to control smart home products. However, unlike the Echo, it can also remember the context of questions, allowing users to ask queries like \"Who is the president of the United States?\" and then follow-ups like \"When was he born?\"\nAmazon, though, has a sizable head start in the smart speaker department. Last week, the company announced that it had launched more than 10,000 skills for its digital assistant Alexa. It\u2019s been available in the UK since last September. \n"}
