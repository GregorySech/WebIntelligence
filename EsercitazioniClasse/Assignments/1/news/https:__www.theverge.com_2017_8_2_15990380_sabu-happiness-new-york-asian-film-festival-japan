{"title": "In the Japanese film Happiness, a technological fix for sadness just makes life worse", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review comes from the New York Asian Film Festival.\nThe Japanese film Happiness is like a dark car driving by slowly in the shadows. As it moves closer, it hardly sheds any light. Then, a window rolls down, revealing a face, staring out at the audience. In a flash, the car is gone, leaving nothing behind but a fleeting impression. \nSimilarly, the film doesn\u2019t explain much about its main character: a stoic, brooding man with an Elvis Presley hairdo. That\u2019s a pity, because Happiness is strongest when it\u2019s fleshing out its characters and building up a narrative of why the audience should care. A eerie silence pervades the film, lingering in every single scene save the climax, where ambient sounds echoes the protagonist\u2019s emotional state. The film doesn\u2019t need music, though. Silence lends the story a kind of realism, which is helpful in a story based in technological fantasy.\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nIndie mystery, featuring a gadget that\u2019s a mix of science fiction and Eastern alternative medicine.\nWhat\u2019s it about?\nHappiness revolves around a mysterious helmet. It\u2019s an amalgamation of golden typewriter keys built in at different angles to create acupuncture stimulation to the noggin. It also looks like a particularly aggressive motorcyclist\u2019s headgear. The helmet\u2019s creator, Kanzaki (played by Masatoshi Nagase), attracts attention around a small Japanese town when he claims the helmet can make wearers happy by triggering forgotten memories of the past. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanzaki shows the helmet works by demonstrating it with film goofball Ishida.\nImage: Livemax Film\n\n\nAlthough the locals initially regard Kanzaki and his helmet suspiciously, his helmet proves its ability to pull up nostalgic memories from the user\u2019s past. A mother of an unruly teenage boy sees her child as a newborn baby, giggling in his cradle again. The film\u2019s goofball, Ishida, sees himself scoring a home run in a baseball game, to the adoration of cheering fans. Kanzaki soon gains local hero status for revitalizing the town, but he still remains an inscrutable character, his past and personal life a mystery. But when he makes his way to treating Inoue (Hiroki Suzuki), a teenage convict who lives in isolation, and takes in the unkempt state of Inoue\u2019s dress and his spa-style slippers, he asks for an extra hour alone with the kid. From there, the film begins to delve into Kanzaki\u2019s personal life. \nWhat\u2019s it really about?\nKanzaki's motives for building the helmet aren't entirely altruistic. The film is concerned with how joy and pain overlap, and how people\u2019s most painful memories could also be their most joyous ones. Happiness explores the extremities of human emotion, psychological trauma, a looming sense of mystery, helplessness (the Japanese belief in shouganai, literally \u201cit can\u2019t be helped\u201d), young misfits, and belligerent angst. \nIs it good?\nHappiness is so close to being enjoyable, but because it throws viewers into scenes without explanation, and delays getting into characters\u2019 backstories until the near end, there isn\u2019t much opportunity to engage with and love these characters. Watching the film can feel like watching paint dry, but at other times, it\u2019s more like reading Agatha Christie\u2019s murder mystery And Then There Were None, or Natsuo Kirino\u2019s Out, where middle-aged Japanese women bury a person they\u2019ve helped kill. Those novels are packed with twist after blood-dripping twist, and in its best moments, Happiness is as well. It veers between enthralling and exhausting.\nThe flaws in the narrative crop up as early as the first scene, as Kanzaki strolls into a nearly abandoned shop and takes note of the sad old lady sitting in the corner. He returns moments later with the nostalgia helmet. Writer-director Sabu brings the helmet into the story in a such a quick, out-of-context, and contrived way, it\u2019s as if it was dropped into the film from a bad science fiction novel. An aging woman who\u2019s beyond depressed? Throw in the deus ex machina of a magical helmet, and she\u2019s instantly crying and laughing again. It\u2019s an artificial, awkward attention-grabber.\nSabu makes silence do the job of words\nSabu makes silence do the job of words. The camera lingers on Kanzaki\u2019s face, attempting to convey his inner turmoil and the quick turns of his mind as he plots his next move. This works for some scenes, but not all of them. As the camera pauses on Kanzaki walking up multiple flights of stairs, or as tears slowly leak down his face while he\u2019s on a bus, scenes seem to stretch out to eternity. Happiness is a short 91 minutes, but it certainly doesn\u2019t feel that way.\nThe best content darts by: the flashbacks that explain the film\u2019s core mystery, the climatic fight scene, and Kanzaki powerfully hacking and drilling his way into crafting the perfect happiness helmet. Granted, it is a low-budget film, which forces the action to be short and minimal, but the seams shouldn\u2019t show through so easily.  \nWhat should it be rated?\nIt earns an R for gratuitous violence, but those scenes are so few and far between that the rest of this film could pass as G rated. \nHow can I actually watch it?\nHappiness was released in Japan in 2016, and is showing in limited, sporadic theatrical screenings in the US.\n"}
