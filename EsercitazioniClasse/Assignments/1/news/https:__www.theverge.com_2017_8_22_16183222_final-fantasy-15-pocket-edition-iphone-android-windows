{"title": "Final Fantasy XV is being remade as an adorable mobile game", "content": " \nThe role-playing epic Final Fantasy XV is being reimagined for smartphones \u2014 and it\u2019s getting a whole lot cuter in the process. At Gamescom in Germany today, developer Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition, which will be coming to iOS, Android, and Windows 10 this fall.\nIt\u2019s not a spinoff of the main game, or a direct port. Instead, Square Enix describes it as \u201can all-new adventure that retells the beloved story of Final Fantasy XV.\u201d The new version switches things up with a cutesy art style and newly integrated touch controls. Pocket Edition will also feature an all-new structure: the story will be divided into 10 episodes; the first one will be available for free in the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new mobile game is just the latest of a deluge of spinoffs and expansions to be announced since FFXV first debuted last year. While the main game has received a steady stream of new story expansions and will soon be home to a new online multiplayer mode. There\u2019s also been a mobile strategy game, an FFXV car featured in Forza, and on November 21st a virtual reality fishing spinoff is coming to PlayStation VR.\nMeanwhile, just this week Square Enix also announced that an enhanced version of FFXV will be making its way to Windows 10 early next year.\n"}
