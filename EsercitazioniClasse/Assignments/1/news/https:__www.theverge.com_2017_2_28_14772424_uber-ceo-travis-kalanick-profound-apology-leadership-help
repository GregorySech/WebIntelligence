{"title": "Uber CEO says he will seek leadership help after video shows him yelling at driver", "content": " \nUber CEO Travis Kalanick has publicly apologized after a video showing him being rude to an Uber driver was published by Bloomberg. In a blog post titled \u201cA profound apology,\u201d Kalanick said that he was ashamed of his actions, and that he had now accepted that he needed help in leading his company.\n\u201cTo say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement,\u201d Kalanick\u2019s statement reads, referencing the assumption that most Uber employees had already seen the video in question. \u201cMy job as your leader is to lead, and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud. That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away.\u201d\n\n\nTravis responds to the video of him arguing with a driver with an email to employees pic.twitter.com/YOtReTXnij\u2014 Johana Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) March 1, 2017\n\n\n\nKalanick said the issue had prompted him to make some organizational changes. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this video is a reflection of me \u2014 and the criticism we\u2019ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\u201d\nThe apology suggests that Kalanick will aim to elevate other figures, either from within Uber or from without, to similar positions of leadership. The company has come under fire recently for fostering a sexist and toxic working culture in which managers dismiss their team members\u2019 claims and scramble instead to usurp their own bosses. Kalanick himself has made questionable statements in the past \u2014 including his infamous \u201cboob-er\u201d line about his apparently increased appeal to women \u2014 and some have pointed to his cavalier management style as a reason for Uber\u2019s wider problems. \nIt remains to be seen exactly how Kalanick will seek help in leading his company, but it\u2019s clear that he needs to do something to right the ship, and soon, as Uber continues to suffer major body blows. The company is supposed to be valued at $70 billion, but it\u2019s hard to imagine there being much faith in any firm whose CEO has to issue a new public apology every week. \n"}
