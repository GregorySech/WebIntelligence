{"title": "Blue Origin will build its rocket engine in Alabama because the space industry is ruled by politics", "content": " \nToday, private spaceflight venture Blue Origin announced its plans to manufacture the company\u2019s new rocket engine, the BE-4, at a state-of-the-art facility in Huntsville, Alabama. It\u2019s an interesting move for the company, which has been mostly developing the engine at its headquarters in Kent, Washington, and testing the hardware in Texas. But the benefits for Blue Origin are both practical and political.  \nOn the surface, it\u2019s a seemingly innocuous decision meant to capitalize on Huntsville\u2019s decades-long history of rocket development. The city is home to NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center, where the Saturn V rocket was developed and where NASA\u2019s future massive deep-space rocket, the Space Launch System, will also be worked on. Plus, many private space contractors are based in Huntsville, making spaceflight a key part of the city\u2019s economy and a huge jobs creator. It\u2019s why Huntsville has been nicknamed Rocket City.\nthe move is likely motivated by politics\n\u201cAlabama is a great state for aerospace manufacturing and we are proud to produce America\u2019s next rocket engine right here in Rocket City,\u201d Robert Meyerson, president of Blue Origin, said in a statement.\nBut the move is most likely motivated by politics as well, given Blue Origin\u2019s plans for the BE-4. The company ultimately hopes to use seven BE-4 engines to power its future massive rocket called the New Glenn, which is supposed to launch sometime before 2020. But that\u2019s not the only rocket that the BE-4 could fly on. The United Launch Alliance \u2014 a company responsible for launching most of the satellites for the US military \u2014 is developing a new rocket called Vulcan, and it needs new US-made engines for the vehicle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rendering of ULA\u2019s future Vulcan rocket.\nImage: ULA\n\n\nULA has made it very clear that the BE-4 is the first choice to power the Vulcan, and the company is even partially funding the development of the BE-4. That would be a huge contract for Blue Origin, which is still a fairly young player in the realm of aerospace. The problem, though, is that this isn\u2019t a totally done deal. ULA is also considering a second option in case the BE-4 doesn\u2019t work out: an engine being developed by longtime manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne called the AR-1. Aerojet is only meant to be Plan B for ULA. But it has one advantage that Blue Origin didn\u2019t have until now: it\u2019s building its engine in Huntsville, Alabama \u2014 and that comes with some very key political protection. \nULA has made it very clear that the BE-4 is the first choice to power the Vulcan\nBecause Huntsville\u2019s economy is so wrapped up in aerospace, Alabama\u2019s lawmakers want to keep it that way, and a few of them are in key positions to get what they want. For instance, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) is the chairman of the subcommittee responsible for appropriating funds for NASA, and he is constantly fighting to keep the Space Launch System well funded. For fiscal year 2017, Shelby helped to secure $2.15 billion for the rocket\u2019s development, nearly $1 billion more than what was in the president\u2019s budget request. Alabama politicians also raise a fuss whenever they see a threat to any of Alabama\u2019s spaceflight business. Any perceived cuts to SLS funding, and Shelby gets very upset and criticizes officials for not making the rocket a priority.\nThat same \u201cAlabama first\u201d mentality has trickled down to the competition over which engines the Vulcan will use. Since Aerojet is making the AR-1 in Huntsville, a few Alabama politicians have tried to come up with innovative ways of influencing ULA\u2019s decision. A good example came earlier this year, when two Alabama congressmen wrote a letter to the acting US Air Force secretary about the Vulcan\u2019s engine selection, as Ars Technica reported. In the letter, they argued that since ULA receives millions of dollars from the US government to develop the Vulcan, the US government should be involved in the engine selection process. Translation: Alabama lawmakers didn\u2019t want ULA to just pick Blue Origin and leave Aerojet in the dust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rendering of Blue Origin\u2019s facility in Florida, where the New Glenn will be built. Blue Origin considered moving BE-4 production to either Florida or Washington as well.\nImage: Blue Origin\n\n\nBut now that Blue Origin plans to build the BE-4 in Huntsville, there\u2019s perhaps less incentive for Alabama politicians to favor Aerojet over Blue Origin. In fact, the Alabama Governor\u2019s office, the Alabama Department of Commerce, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and many more economic partners all worked together to recruit Blue Origin to the state, according to today\u2019s announcement. If anything, Blue Origin will also be under the protective Alabama umbrella now, and it could probably use some protection: Blue Origin suffered a setback a few months ago when it lost a set of key BE-4 engine hardware during testing. It\u2019s unclear how much the development process was disrupted, but it\u2019s possible the failure may have slightly jeopardized Blue Origin\u2019s status as the frontrunner in the engine race. \n\u201cAlabama has that same sort of strong technical work force.\u201d\nOf course, Blue Origin probably also had some nice economic incentives to move to the state that factored into the decision. And the company will definitely have a good support system there. Blue Origin\u2019s move to Huntsville is supposed to generate 342 jobs at the new facility, located in Cummings Research Park, with salaries averaging $75,000. And given the city\u2019s history, Blue Origin should have no problem finding aerospace experts in the area. Phil Larson, a former science advisor to the Obama administration and a former SpaceX spokesperson, pointed out that SpaceX, in part, moved to Los Angeles because it had the largest concentration of aerospace engineers in the country at the time. \u201cAlabama has that same sort of strong technical work force,\u201d he tells The Verge.\nThe move will likely make many in Alabama happy since Blue Origin expects to make $200 million in capital investment in the state. Of course, the company says it will only build the facility once ULA officially selects the BE-4 as the Vulcan\u2019s main engine. Perhaps now there will be fewer people standing in Blue Origin\u2019s way. At the very least, the company seems to have made an ally of Sen. Shelby.\n\"This announcement today is excellent news for our state,\u201d Shelby said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased to see Blue Origin investing in Alabama, and I look forward to working with them and other businesses to continue boosting economic development opportunities.\u201d \n\n\n"}
