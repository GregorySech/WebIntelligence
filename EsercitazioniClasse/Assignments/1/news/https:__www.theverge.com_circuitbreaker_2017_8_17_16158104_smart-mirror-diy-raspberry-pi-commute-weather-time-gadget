{"title": "Building your own smart mirror is surprisingly easy", "content": " \nSmart mirrors are straight from science fiction. They\u2019re part of an optimistic vision of the future that imagines a world where screens and data are everywhere, ready to feed you whatever information you need at a moment\u2019s notice. \nBut it turns out that building your own smart mirror isn\u2019t just science fiction \u2014 it\u2019s actually really easy to put one together. So don\u2019t wait around for some random Kickstarter to get its act together and sell you a smart mirror. Here\u2019s how to build one yourself.\nSupplies\n\nA Raspberry Pi 3, or an older Raspberry Pi with a Wi-Fi adapter.\nA monitor with HDMI-in. This will be the screen for the smart mirror, so whatever size you choose is how big your mirror will ultimately be. It should also power a USB device, so you won\u2019t need a second plug for the Pi.\nA two-way glass mirror. You\u2019ll want to get one that\u2019s the same size as your monitor. Acrylic ones will work, but the end result will be a lot dimmer (although it\u2019s much cheaper).\nA mouse and keyboard, which you\u2019ll need to get things set up on the Pi.\nA frame for the mirror. In the build here, I used a shadow box from a local art store. (We put some cardboard matting in for the parts that were too wide.) Depending on your preference, you can find something similar or build a custom frame yourself. \nTools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it together\nThe hardest part of building a smart mirror comes down to physically building the frame and hardware. The software side of things is more or less taken care of by the fabulously well-documented and polished MagicMirror\u00b2 project, created by Michael Teeuw. So, once your Raspberry Pi is set up, you\u2019ll want to install MagicMirror\u00b2, which can be done simply by running this line of code on your Raspberry Pi.\nbash -c \"$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/master/installers/raspberry.sh)\"\nIf you prefer to do things by hand, there\u2019s also a manual installation guide located on the project\u2019s GitHub page. \nThat installation will take 10\u201320 minutes, but once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re technically all set. But since we\u2019re on a Raspberry Pi, there are a couple extra steps in the basic setup, like disabling the screensaver, rotating the screen (assuming you\u2019re using a vertical mirror), and making sure the Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t shut off into a power-saving mode. Fortunately, MagicMirror has all these things documented, too, so follow those instructions here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the fun part: actually customizing your smart mirror. Out of the box, MagicMirror runs the following modules: Clock, Calendar, Current Weather, Weather Forecast, News Feed, Compliments, Hello World, and Alert. Some of those \u2014 like weather \u2014 need additional setup, including registering for an API key and adding your location. But because MagicMirror is open source, there\u2019s a huge community of third-party developers creating additional modules, that let you add everything from commute time to Alexa voice control to your mirror. \nDetailed instructions are, you guessed it, on the GitHub documentation page, but as a quick overview: you\u2019ll need to install the module to the ~/MagicMirror/modules directory, and then add the code for the module to the config/config.js file using a text editor. (I prefer Geany, which is installed along most Raspian installations.) That config.js file is also where you\u2019ll be able to customize where things are located on the screen.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got everything installed and arranged to your liking, it\u2019s time to turn the smart screen into a smart mirror. To do that, put your two-way mirror in your frame (making sure the reflective side is out) and mount it onto your monitor. Alternatively, if you\u2019re willing to put a little more DIY effort into things, you can take the monitor\u2019s hardware out of the plastic casing and build a more permanent housing for it and your mirror. \nThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve officially got your own smart mirror. Take that, Snow White. \n\n"}
