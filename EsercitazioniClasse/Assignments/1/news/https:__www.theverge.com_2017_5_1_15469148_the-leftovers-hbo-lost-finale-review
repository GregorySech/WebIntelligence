{"title": "You hated Lost's ending? It's time to watch The Leftovers", "content": " \nWith The Leftovers complete, we\u2019ve decided to republish this story from earlier in the season. The finale, one of the show\u2019s best episodes, is small, quiet, and \u2014 for a show about grief, death, and existential ambiguity \u2014 daringly optimistic about the beauty of life. Yes, if you hated the Lost finale, you should watch. But really, the show\u2019s recommendation extends to everybody who enjoys art that pushes them to ask questions and, when they don\u2019t find perfect answers, to embrace mystery.\nThis piece was originally published on May 1st, 2017.\nFor three years following the 2010 finale of Lost \u2014 the network drama about a plane crash on a tropical island, metaphysics, and a statue with only four toes \u2014 co-creator Damon Lindelof fielded questions from fans and critics who were unsatisfied with how the show did or didn\u2019t explain its biggest mysteries. The Verge itself may have provided one the most confrontational interviews, a whopping 25-minute interrogation. It\u2019s no surprise that Lindelof wrote in a 2013 issue of The Hollywood Reporter that he would no longer defend the show. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm out.\u201d\nBut just as Jack returned to the island, Lindelof has returned to the worlds of TV mystery and feverish fan criticism. The Leftovers, Lindelof\u2019s first show since Lost, is perhaps the finest mea culpa a creator could offer a spurned fan base. It began its third and final season this month.\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see what Lindelof found appealing about The Leftover\u2019s source material: in Tom Perrotta's novel of the same name, 2 percent of Earth\u2019s population inexplicably, instantaneously disappears. The title refers to the 98 percent of the world left behind, whose grief and existential reckoning are the story\u2019s foundation. It\u2019s a sprawling spiritual mystery built around questions so big and abstract, they couldn\u2019t possibly warrant concrete answers. Perhaps in Perrotta, Lindelof found a creative kindred spirit.\nQuestions so big and abstract, they couldn\u2019t possibly warrant concrete answers\nThe first season of the show, co-created and largely co-written by Lindelof and Perrotta, broadly mirrors the book. Three years after the departures, the world has collectively tried to return to normalcy \u2014 or at least is committed to pretending everything\u2019s fine. Then the status quo begins to crack, beginning with the life of Mapleton, New York, police chief Kevin Garvey, Jr. (Justin Theroux). Garvey\u2019s nuclear family \u2014 has been split by a pair of powerful cult leaders. His son seeks to erase the pain from human consciousness; his wife is determined to prevent the world from ever forgetting the departed; his daughter just wants a shot at being a normal teenager. \nThe Leftovers goes beyond Perrotta\u2019s novel with its second and third seasons, and in the process, its similarities with Lost have become more pronounced.\nBoth television shows use extended flashbacks to contrast the lives of their ensemble casts before and after the reality-bending event at their center. And both shows are comfortable stepping away from their protagonists to spend entire episodes developing backstory of the supporting players.\nBoth The Leftovers and Lost are fixated on regret, family, and death. Both shows share certain symbols and imagery, sometimes to an almost giggle-worthy degree: leaders in white, men and their dogs, and damp pits that host, of all things, cosmic duels. And both involve late series trips to purgatory. Lost is more character-focused than it\u2019s given credit for, and The Leftovers is becoming stranger by the episode; it\u2019s as if the two may meet somewhere near the middle.\nBoth shows are fixated on regret, family and death\nHowever The Leftovers shrewdly sidesteps most of Lost\u2019s storytelling traps. How it does that speaks to the ways Lindelof has evolved as a writer \u2014 or simply been given the proper creative breathing room.\nLost is a complicated show, a product of many creators, producers, and a large writer\u2019s room with, most notoriously, co-creator J.J. Abrams. Lost was a launching pad for the writer-director-producer\u2019s narrative innovation or catastrophe, depending on who you ask, called the Mystery Box. \nAbrams introduced the Mystery Box a decade ago in a 2007 TED Talk, and honed it in a 2009 Wired essay. The core takeaway is that, sometimes, mystery is more important than knowledge. \nWhen talking about the Mystery Box, people often forget the concept is predicated on technology, specifically the capacity of modern computer animation to visualize concepts that were previously cost prohibitive if not unfilmable. In the TED Talk, Abrams plays a quick moment from the Lost pilot in which a man is sucked into a jet engine. \u201cTen years ago, if we wanted to do that, we would have had to kill a stuntman.\u201d He later points to his laptop, and says he imagines it saying to him, each time he sits at the keyboard, \u201cWhat are you going to write worthy of me?\u201d\nThe Mystery Box is a byproduct of computer animation\nAbrams saw the modern Mystery Box as an opportunity afforded by technology, if not the result of it. \nAbrams has spoken about how Lost\u2019s creators \u2014 needing to take a pilot from script to two-hour episode in 11 and a half weeks \u2014 didn\u2019t have time to develop the story, a process that can span months or years in the television industry. The network had wanted a pilot ASAP. It\u2019s practically a Cohen brothers synopsis: then-head of ABC, Lloyd Braun, had a vague idea of the Lost concept while on vacation in 2003; the two-hour piloted aired in July of the following year.\nBecause of the rush, the small creative team had nobody second-guessing their wildest ideas, and because of the technology, they had the opportunity to put it all on the screen. This model carried throughout the series. Ergo tropical polar bears, cosmic battles of good and evil, and, of course, the four-toed statue. Lost borrowed extensively from the conspiratorial documentaries of basic cable: ancient Egyptian religion, extraterrestrial life, global government conspiracies. No mystery was too esoteric to be repacked inside the Mystery Box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Leftovers often feels, like a Lost do over \u2014 either a rebuttal of the Mystery Box, or its most extreme extrapolation. It asks (light\u2019em if you got\u2019em) \u201cWhat if life is the ultimate Mystery Box?\u201d If so, if we\u2019re inside the box, then shouldn\u2019t the real mystery be who or what is waiting for us outside? \nThis is the engine of The Leftovers: people have become acutely aware that there is a place beyond our existential box, but now they must continue life within it. \nAnd so, viewed from the right angle, The Leftovers is an inversion of Lost. Lost is the story of people who disappeared; The Leftovers is the story of people the people who were left behind. Mostly set on the island, Lost is rich with mysteries of this new, unusual place. The Leftovers, particularly in its first and second seasons, is set in cities in which characters struggle to find meaning.\nThe Leftovers is an inversion of Lost\nThe Leftovers doesn\u2019t bother with comparably small mysteries about polar bears and secret bunkers. There is no magical island, no mysterious corporation. There\u2019s the United States, its government, and a series of cultists, conspirators, and small-scale commercial ventures. As it turns out, those can be plenty menacing and mysterious. And so Lindelof, Perrotta, and the show\u2019s small team of writers have shown a greater interest in how mystery affects the psyche of their characters, rather than how it appeases their viewers.\nThe writers take every opportunity to toy with conspiracy theorists. Over the 20-some episodes that have aired, protagonist Kevin Garvey undergoes out-of-body experiences, hallucinations, and a visit to a literal purgatory that resembles the most mundane convention center hotel. But even Kevin, for all his mental unraveling, recognizes when a mystery is silly. In the premiere of the third season, an old acquaintance informs Kevin that a politician shares the DNA of dogs, and that K9s plan to inherit the Earth. Kevin looks him, equally concerned and annoyed.\nIn season 2, Kevin\u2019s girlfriend Nora Durst is hopeful scientists have discovered why her entire family disappeared. She laughs when the voice on the other end of the phone explains that according to the data, the departure was the result of the demon Azrael. She seems almost relieved by the absurdity. She doesn\u2019t get a resolution, but for Nora, all the pain of not knowing still beats an unsatisfying answer. \nThe Leftovers has a love/hate relationship with conspiracy theorists\nIt\u2019s tempting to frame The Leftovers as the version of Lost that Lindelof would have made without J.J. Abrams, co-creator Jeffrey Lieber, or Carlton Cuse, who served as showrunner and head writer alongside Lindelof. But it\u2019s hard to imagine Lindelof would have produced the HBO show without his time at ABC.\nThe Leftovers\u2019 development and creation appears, from the outside, to be a reaction to Lost\u2019s neck-breaking sprint into production, and its sprawl of 121 episodes over six years. When finished, The Leftovers will consist of a diminutive 28 episodes, aired over four years. \nLindelof has long blamed the lengthy seasons and expectations of network TV for a number of Lost\u2019s problems. The Leftovers\u2019 quality supports his claim. The show is clock-like in its precision and intent. Every piece has its purpose. A seemingly out-of-place flashback to thousands of years in the past begins season 2, and subtly lays the groundwork for a twist near that season\u2019s finale. Mentions of Australia serve as background noise of the first season, but the country gradually moves to the center of the story in season 3. \nEven when the show\u2019s big mysteries aren\u2019t answered, they\u2019re addressed. For example, The Leftovers might not want to be explicit about whether a character can actually commune with the dead, or literally hug away grief, so its writers instead script scenes exploring why people would want to believe miracles are possible. Why do we so eagerly crave the impossible? Why do we want to believe? And why do we want explanations for the unexplainable? \nHBO gave Lindelof the time and freedom unavailable at ABC\nBut for all its ambitions and improvements, The Leftovers still shares its biggest mystery with Lost: death is terrifying and it comes for all of us, so what\u2019s the point?\nStrip away all the frills, and Lost is the story of Dr. Jack Shephard and his journey to accepting the death of his father, his patients, and ultimately, himself. You don\u2019t dedicate a chunk of a series finale to an afterlife waiting room, if the show isn\u2019t wondering at its very core what we\u2019re all waiting for.\nI\u2019m not certain why millions of Lost fans preferred the mystery of the early seasons to the mortal quandaries of the finale. But if I had to guess, I\u2019d wager, for the average person, it\u2019s more pleasurable to count the toes on a statue than it is to remember we all die and we have no idea what comes next. \nLost, from the very beginning, was caught between two separate ideas: the artificially unknowable Mystery Box and the spiritually unknowable, well, existence. Which is to say, from the very beginning, it was doomed to lose in a battle with itself.\nLindelof said in an that 2012 interview with The Verge, \u201cThe things that capture my imagination [...] are sometimes frustrating and challenging.\u201d The Leftovers is both those things. But what\u2019s special about The Leftovers, and why I suspect it will stick its landing in the coming weeks, is it refuses to pretend to be anything other than an existential mind-fuck.\nThis is Lindelof\u2019s true, final response to all the Lost critics, more empathic than anybody would have expected: a loving declaration that, when confronted with mystery, it\u2019s natural to look for answers \u2014 even when you know you won\u2019t find them.\n"}
