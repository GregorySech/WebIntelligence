Honor tells us people will start seeing Nougat today and that all phones will be updated by the end of February. Meanwhile, the new Honor 6X isn\u2019t getting the most recent version of Android until Q2 of this year. We were slightly disappointed when the 6X launched in January without Nougat, but making us wait longer is kind of way more disappointing? \nHonor made its US debut with the Honor 5X, and as far as we can tell, that phone isn\u2019t getting Android N anytime in the very near future. We\u2019ve reached out for a more precise timeline. Still, Honor has pledged to maintain at least a 24-month software update cycle for devices released from 2016 on, including the 5X.\nMost US users have taken issue with Honor\u2019s Android skin. Honor said it worked with its US fans to design the Nougat update. With Android N, users will be able to add an optional app drawer, customize their quick controls, and work in multiple windows simultaneously. \n\n\nbeta testers hated the Honor 8's software design so much that the Nougat update includes a button to make the icons look like stock Android pic.twitter.com/m3ZEWabXRf\u2014 easy d (@dcseifert) February 10, 2017\n\n\n\nApparently the refreshed design was also inspired by the \u201cAegean Sea landscape.\u201d So there you have it: Americans love the Aegean Sea vibe. \n\n"}
