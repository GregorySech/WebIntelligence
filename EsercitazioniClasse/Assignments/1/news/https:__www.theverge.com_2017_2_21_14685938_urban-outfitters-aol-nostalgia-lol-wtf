{"title": "This Urban Outfitters AOL T-shirt will cost you more than an actual monthly service charge", "content": " \nIf you\u2019re more into wearing your internet companies than using them, then good news! Urban Outfitters is selling an America Online-branded shirt. Spotted by Tech Insider, this nostalgia-stained attempt at fashion will cost you $45. That\u2019s more than it would cost you to actually use AOL\u2019s paid service, the priciest of which costs $25.90 a month. Yes, you can still subscribe to AOL.\nBased on Urban Outfitters\u2019 photos, the T-shirt\u2019s features include the ability to roll your sleeves, stare wistfully into the distance while pondering the existence of the not-so-deep web, and a lot of stretch if you yank aggressively on the hem. That\u2019d be great for cleaning up food messes in my kitchen. It doesn\u2019t offer email, an internet connection, or even the AOL dial-up noise that causes my left eye to twitch with anticipation. \nAs a longtime Urban Outfitter shopper (akin to an apologist) of \u201cold things\u201d like record players and film cameras, I get the appeal here. So vintage! Remember SmarterChild? But like... that\u2019s $45 for a T-shirt. You can still find an old CD of 1045 free AOL hours on eBay for $3, and I bet it won\u2019t even shrink the first time you wash it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
