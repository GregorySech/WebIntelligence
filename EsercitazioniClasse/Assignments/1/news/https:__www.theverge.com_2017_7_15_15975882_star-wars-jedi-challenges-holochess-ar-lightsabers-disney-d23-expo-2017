{"title": "Disney is making a Star Wars holochess game with augmented reality", "content": " \nEarlier this year at WWDC, Apple showed off an augmented reality demo that used an iPad to recreate the famous Dejarik holochess game from Star Wars. It turns out that was more than just a tech demo: today Disney announced that it is creating an actual augmented reality platform that it will use to bring that game and other projects to life.\nThe product uses two pieces to work its magic. The first is a new augmented reality headset, made in conjunction with Lenovo. The device then pairs with a user\u2019s smartphone to do the rest of the heavy lifting. A number of different applications were teased, including the holochess game \u2014 which put the animated, holographic monsters on top of a table or other surface \u2014 as well as a battle where tiny augmented reality Rebel cartoon characters faced off against an AT-AT. \nThe different applications all fall under the brand name Jedi Challenges, and of course that name brings one particular use to mind: lightsabers. While no specifics about the lightsaber experience were detailed, it\u2019s easy to imagine an AR game that will let customers strap on the Disney and Lenovo headset \u2014 much like Luke Skywalker did in the original film \u2014 and use an AR lightsaber to fight off bolts from a training remote. \nThere\u2019s no release date yet for the product \u2014 further details were promised in the months ahead \u2014 but Disney clearly felt confident enough about the project\u2019s potential to showcase it during D23. The question remains whether customers will actually be interested in strapped a headset to their face to play games in this fashion, or if the allure of augmented reality will appeal to audiences at all. Then again, the exact same arguments could have been made about something like Pok\u00e9mon Go. The lesson with that game was that people are eager to engage with characters and properties they\u2019re passionate about, even if it breaks traditional rules of gaming. And when it comes to fans, it\u2019s hard to imagine any more fervent than those that love Star Wars.\n"}
