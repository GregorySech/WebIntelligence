{"title": "A Google mixed reality experiment puts a fake face on top of your VR headset", "content": " \nMixed reality videos \u2014 where a video camera and a green screen are used to show what a person using VR is experiencing \u2014 aren\u2019t  particularly new. But a recent collaboration between Google\u2019s Daydream and Research teams has come up with a new spin on mixed reality by making the VR headsets transparent so you can actually \u201csee\u201d the user\u2019s face.\nOf course, Google hasn\u2019t actually invented a way to magically X-ray through a VR headset. Rather, using a combination of a 3D scanned model of a person\u2019s face, along with an HTC Vive headset modified with eye tracking technology allows for a digital recreation of the person\u2019s face to be substituted in place. To prevent a disconcerting uncanny valley effect, a translucent version of the headset is left in place, to create some mental distance for a viewer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Google Research blog dives deeper into how the system works. Each 3D scan typically takes less than a minute and creates a database of eye gazes and blinks, which the software then maps to the data from the eye tracking system in the headset. Additionally, the software color corrects the digitally created face portion to match the lighting of the rest of the user\u2019s face. \nFor now, the transparent headset effect remains a cool research project, with no formal release information for either developers or consumers. But Google is apparently \u201cexploring how to bring this technology to select creators in the future,\u201d so it\u2019s possible we could see the tech show up somewhere down the line. \n"}
