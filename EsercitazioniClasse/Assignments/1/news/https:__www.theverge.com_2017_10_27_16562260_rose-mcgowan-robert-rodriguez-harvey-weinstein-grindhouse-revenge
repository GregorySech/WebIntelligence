{"title": "Rose McGowan\u2019s role in Grindhouse was revenge on Harvey Weinstein", "content": " \nWhen filmmaker Robert Rodriguez cast actress Rose McGowan in the B-movie exploitation flick Grindhouse, it was more than finding the right actor for the right role: it was a defiant middle finger to disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\nIn a statement to Variety, Rodriguez explains that he met the actress at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where she told him that she had been raped by Weinstein eight years prior. In the aftermath of the assault, the actress found herself blacklisted from appearing in any films connected to Weinstein or his influential studio.\n\u201cI then revealed to Rose right then and there that I was about to start writing a movie with Quentin Tarantino, a double-feature throwback to \u201870s exploitation movies, and that if she was interested, I would write her a BAD ASS character and make her one of the leads,\u201d said the filmmaker. \u201cI wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her OFF the blacklist, and the best part is that we would have Harvey\u2019s new Weinstein Company pay for the whole damn thing.\u201d\nThat movie was 2007\u2019s Grindhouse, a double-feature comprised of Tarantino\u2019s Death Proof, which starred Zo\u00eb Bell and Kurt Russell, and Rodriguez\u2019s Planet Terror. In the latter film, McGowan plays Cherry, a dancer who finds herself in the midst of a zombie apocalypse \u2014 and ends up killing two rapists before the credits roll. The film tanked at the box office, which Rodriguez attributes to Weinstein personally burying the movie because of McGowan\u2019s involvement.\nOver the past month, profiles from The New York Times and The New Yorker have exposed decades of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, with prominent actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, and filmmakers like Asia Argento, all coming forward to document tales of inappropriate behavior, harassment, and rape perpetrated by Weinstein. The revelations have torpedoed the producer\u2019s career, but they\u2019ve also led to a broader cultural moment where sexual harassment and assault across the entertainment industry and all workplaces is being recognized in a meaningful way.\nDespite learning about the allegations, Rodriguez continued to make films for Weinstein-related companies\nRodriguez says casting McGowan was way of striking back against Weinstein\u2019s predatory behavior (Rodriguez and McGowan were in a relationship from 2006 through 2009). But it\u2019s also worth noting that despite learning about McGowan\u2019s allegations, the filmmaker continued working with Weinstein-related companies in subsequent years, including on the 2011 film Spy Kids 4 and 2014\u2019s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. \nIn his statement, Rodriguez suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry needs to do more to address the systemic problem of sexual harassment. \u201cThese past few weeks have given me new clarity and hope by seeing the tide finally turn, seeing Harvey finally on the run, and seeing all the brave women who have come forth with their own shocking and distressing stories of abuse,\u201d he writes. \u201cSince I\u2019ve seen a distinct lack of stories coming from men who may have tried to do the right thing, I wanted to come forth to say that no matter the consequences, no matter how far you have to stick your neck out, no matter what you have to lose, that we must fight the good fight. Everyone has to make a stand and take action.\u201d\n"}
