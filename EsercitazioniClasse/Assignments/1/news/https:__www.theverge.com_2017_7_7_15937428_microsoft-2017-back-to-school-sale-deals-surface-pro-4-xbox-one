{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s 2017 \u2018back to school\u2019 sale is way worse than last year\u2019s", "content": " \nIt\u2019s July, which means that school will be back before you know it, and Microsoft is the first to kick off back to school discount season with its 2017 offerings. While there are certainly some nice deals on stuff like the Surface Pro 4, none of them really hold a candle to last year\u2019s offer of a free Xbox One. \nThe standout item on this year\u2019s deal is a Surface Pro 4 bundle that includes a type cover for $999, or $899 if you\u2019re a student with a valid .edu account. That\u2019s not a bad deal, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the Surface Pro 4 is almost two years old at this point, which makes this feel more like Microsoft clearing stock for the 2017 Surface Pro. \nMicrosoft is also offering up to $150 off a Surface Book, if that\u2019s more your speed, and throwing in a free three-month Groove (Microsoft\u2019s subscription music service) membership with all Surface purchases. Lastly, various Xbox One S bundles will get a $20 price cut during the back to school sale, bringing the price down to $279.99. \nThe back to school deals start today, July 7th. The Surface Book discount runs until July 15th, the Xbox One S deal until August 30th, the Groove membership offer through September 15th, and the Surface Pro 4 deal runs until September 19th.  \n"}
