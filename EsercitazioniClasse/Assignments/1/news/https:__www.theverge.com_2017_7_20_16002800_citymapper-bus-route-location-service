{"title": "Transport app Citymapper is launching a real, paid bus service in London", "content": " \nEarlier this year, transport app Citymapper started running an experimental bus route in central London. Today, the company announced that its service is now fully-licensed \u2014 meaning it can start charging customers. Citymapper\u2019s first route will open to the public sometime in late August or early September, and will run on Friday and Saturday nights, 9PM to 5AM, right through East London. \nBut why is an app running a bus route? Well, Citymapper say it\u2019s because it thinks it can offer something that London\u2019s public transport doesn\u2019t. With the help of its user data, the company says it\u2019s identified areas and times that Transport for London \u2014 the city\u2019s transport agency \u2014 aren\u2019t currently servicing. \nAs the firm explains in a Medium post: \u201cWe found central London fairly well covered during the day by existing services, but we identified bigger gaps in the night network. People in London are staying out later, especially in East London. For example there are more late night destinations on Commercial Road, without any night bus support.\u201d \nA spokesperson for TfL commented: \u201cThe service will link a string of venues across east London and will operate ahead of the launch of the Night Overground in December, transforming night-time connections across the local area. We will be assessing the Citymapper service to see what lessons might be drawn for night-time transport provision in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interior of Citymapper\u2019s buses match the app\u2019s green theme. \nImage: Citymapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe route of Citymapper\u2019s new bus service \u2014 launching later in August or early September. \nImage: Citymapper\n\n\nBeing a tech company, Citymapper also says its buses will be smarter than the average double-decker. The vehicles will anonymously count the number of passengers onboard; smart displays will give riders clear information about upcoming stops; while Citymapper will use its data to inform drivers about potential road and traffic problems. And, there\u2019ll be USB chargers under every seat \u2014 the perfect service to offer on a night bus when your phone\u2019s about to die. \nThe route is launching with the approval of Transport for London, but it won\u2019t be tapped into the agency\u2019s contactless Oyster card payment system. Instead, riders will be able to pay with contactless credit and debit cards, or with their phones, using Android Pay or Apple Pay. There\u2019s no word on how much the company will charge though. \nSilicon Valley tech firms trying to re-invent the bus has become something of a meme, with people often pointing out that the companies are just trying to provide a service for rich people without inventing anything new. Citymapper has obviously clocked on to this, though, and in the Medium post announcing its new commercial route, it pre-empts the criticism by giving two separate definitions of what it\u2019s up to: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s cleared that up then. \n"}
