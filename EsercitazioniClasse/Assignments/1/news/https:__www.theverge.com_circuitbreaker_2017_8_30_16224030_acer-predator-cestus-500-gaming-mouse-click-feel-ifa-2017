{"title": "Acer\u2019s new gaming mouse has adjustable click resistance", "content": " \nAcer\u2019s new Predator Cestus 500 mouse is a high-end ambidextrous gaming mouse with a few customization options. But what makes it stand out is the \u201cdual switch\u201d design which allows you to change between light and heavier click resistance based on what game you\u2019re playing.\nWe\u2019ll have to try it out to see how well it works. \u201cClick feel\u201d typically ranks after tracking and comfort, as far as mouse priorities go, but everyone I know has a click preference and it\u2019s nice for a mouse to offer variety. Acer claims FPS players prefer a hair trigger, while RTS players like a more difficult click, but I\u2019ve also heard the opposite. I personally prefer a minimal resistance to my clicks out of sheer laziness. The real win would be the ability to switch click feel between games, instead of swapping in an entirely new mouse.\nRazer\u2019s Mamba mouse has \u201cAdjustable Click Force Technology,\u201d with 14 distinct click feels that are adjusted by an Allen key, so Acer isn\u2019t breaking entirely new ground here. What\u2019s different is the price: Acer\u2019s mouse is $79.99, while the Mamba goes for $149.99 (though, to be fair, the Mamba is also wireless). The Cestus 500 will be available in November.\nOh, and check out these sweet side fins on the left and right mouse buttons. I\u2019ve never had a problem with falling off the mouse, but this extra level of safety could be nice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
