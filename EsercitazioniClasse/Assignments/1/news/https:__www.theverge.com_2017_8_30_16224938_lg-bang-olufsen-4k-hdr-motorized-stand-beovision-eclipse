{"title": "Bang & Olufsen teams up with LG on this stunning OLED television", "content": " \nLG and Bang & Olufsen have revealed their new OLED television called the BeoVision Eclipse, their first TV produced in a partnership announced last year. The BeoVision is a 4K TV and 450 watt music system that features a 3-channel sound bar with integrated internet radio and music streaming. The TV claims to deliver \u201cabsolute black and infinite contrast ratio\u201d and high dynamic range (HDR) as you\u2019d expect from LG\u2019s much lauded OLED panels. It also features a motorized floor stand that can move the TV around the room soundlessly at the press of a button \u2014 making the TV adjustable to your position if you\u2019re fidgety or move around a lot. The Eclipse can also be mounted on a motorized or manual wall bracket, and controlled with the BeoRemote One BT remote.\nAdaptability is one of the major selling points of the Eclipse. It comes with LG\u2019s webOS 3.5, enabling users to access and customize streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, Deezer, and features built-in support for Spotify Connect, Chromecast, and AirPlay audio as well as simple Bluetooth streaming. The speaker itself is physically customizable, with choices of aluminum or different colored fabrics. It can also be expanded to support a multi-channel surround sound system by adding Bang & Olufsen\u2019s BeoLab loudspeakers, with the TV\u2019s speaker then acting as the center channel.\nThe BeoVision Eclipse comes in 55- and 65-inch sizes, and will cost $10,990, and $15,990 respectively. They\u2019ll be on sale in Bang & Olufsen retailers starting in September.\n"}
