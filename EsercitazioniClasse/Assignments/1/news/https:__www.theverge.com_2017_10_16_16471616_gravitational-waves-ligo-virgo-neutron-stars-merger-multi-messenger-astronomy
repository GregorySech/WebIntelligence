{"title": "For the first time, astronomers detect gravitational waves from two neutron stars colliding", "content": " \nOnce again, scientists have detected gravitational waves \u2014 ripples in the fabric of space and time created by objects moving throughout the Universe. And this time, the celestial signal stems from a never-before-seen event: the merger of two neutron stars. In contrast to past observations of gravitational waves, the event was also detectable by regular light telescopes, giving scientists unprecedented insight into this cosmic collision.\na never-before-seen event\nThis is because all four previous wave detections have come from the mergers of black holes, which are events that don't emit light. But these waves were created from the violent collision of two distant neutron stars, the superdense leftovers of stars after they\u2019ve collapsed. When these two objects combined, they spiraled around each other rapidly before smashing into one another, creating a gigantic fireball of light visible to telescopes on Earth.\n\nThree different gravitational wave observatories across the globe picked up the signal in August: the dual US-based observatories operated by LIGO (which made the first wave detection in history last year) as well as a third observatory, Virgo, which is located in Italy. Thanks to this trio of inputs, astronomers located the area where the merger occurred, narrowing it down to a very small patch in the southern sky.\nOnce the general area was known, LIGO mobilized the rest of the astronomy community. Within just a few hours of the detection, thousands of astronomers operating up to 70 ground-based and space-based telescopes were searching the sky \u2014 eventually spotting the explosive leftovers of the merger. They continued to observe the event for weeks after the collision, learning more about how the chaotic object evolved over time. \nthe beginning of a new era known as \u201cmulti-messenger astronomy\u201d\nUntil now, light was really the only tool astronomers had to study objects in space. Scientists can learn more about distant objects by observing them in various wavelengths of light \u2014 from visible light to light we can\u2019t see, like X-rays and infrared. But now, both light and gravitational waves can be used to study celestial events together, marking the beginning of a new era known as \u201cmulti-messenger astronomy.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a revolution in astronomy, of having thousands of astronomers focus on one source for weeks and having this collaboration unravel in seconds, in hours, then days, and weeks,\u201d Vicky Kalogera, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University and one of the LIGO collaborators, tells The Verge. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s the Holy Grail.\u201d\nA long time coming\nThis astronomical revolution comes less than two years after the first gravitational wave was detected. Astronomers have been trying to figure out how to detect these ripples for the last century, ever since they were first predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Einstein argued that objects in the Universe actually warp the space and time around them. And when they move, they create waves in this space-time, a bit like a boat leaving ripples in a pond.\ndetecting these waves is an incredibly difficult process\nBut detecting these waves is an incredibly difficult process. The ripples from nearby planets and stars, for instance, are much too small to pick up from Earth. That\u2019s why scientists look for the biggest waves they can find \u2014 ones coming from the most massive objects in the Universe moving at rapid speeds. Merging black holes and neutron stars offered the perfect targets.\n\n\n\n\nWhen these superdense objects combine, they actually spiral around each other, growing closer and closer together over time. The spinning increases in frequency until the two objects are revolving around each other up to several times per second before combining in one forceful impact. This sort of activity creates gargantuan gravitational waves, which travel through the Universe at the speed of light. They fade away during their journey, but still make it to Earth in a diminished form. The LIGO and Virgo observatories have to use incredibly sensitive laser technology to pick up the signals from these waves. (Learn more about how those observatories work here.)\nUntil now, all four of the detections made by LIGO have been from mergers of black holes\nUntil now, though, all four of the detections made by LIGO have been from mergers of black holes. These discoveries told scientists a great deal about the types of black holes found in our Universe, but they don\u2019t offer much opportunity for follow-up observations. Black holes have incredibly strong gravitational pulls, so nothing \u2014 not even light \u2014 can escape from them. Even if astronomers could pinpoint where a black hole merger occurred, telescopes that observe light wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything. That\u2019s why astronomers have been eager to find merging neutron stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Virgo observatory near Pisa, Italy.\nPhoto: Virgo\n\n\nScientists have been getting a lot better at locating where these mergers come from, too, thanks to the recent addition of Virgo. The first three detections were made by LIGO\u2019s observatories alone, but the fourth signal was also seen by Virgo. Having three detectors pick up waves makes it much easier to find the sources of these signals in the sky. By timing when the waves reach each detector, astronomers can triangulate the location of the wave source in space, similar to how three GPS satellites are used to pinpoint the location of something on Earth. \nAstronomers just needed a source other than black holes that they could actually see.\nFinding the signal\nOn August 17th at 8:41AM ET, just before LIGO and Virgo were scheduled to stop observations after a months-long run, both of LIGO\u2019s observatories in Washington and Louisiana picked up what looked to be a gravitational wave signal. Immediately, astronomers suspected that it was from two neutron stars colliding, since the wave perturbed LIGO\u2019s instruments for over a minute and a half (much longer than previous signals from black holes, which lasted just fractions of a second). It was a sign that the merging objects were much smaller than black holes. \u201cNeutron stars are so much smaller than black holes, so they get much closer together before they merge,\u201d Laura Cadonati, a LIGO collaborator and professor of physics at Georgia Institute of Technology, tells The Verge. \u201cSo you can observe the waves for a long time, and get a nice, long, beautiful signal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rendering of the neutron star merger at the moment of impact.\nImage: Carnegie Institution for Science\n\n\nAt the same time LIGO got its signal, NASA\u2019s Fermi space telescope (in orbit around Earth) detected an intense burst of high-energy light, known as a gamma ray burst, coming from deep space. Astronomers have suspected that neutron stars may create these beams of high-energy radiation when they collide because the explosions are so hot and powerful. Detecting a burst at the same time as a wave signal made the astronomers confident they were seeing two neutron stars merge.\nMeanwhile, astronomers initially thought Virgo had missed the signal, since it wasn\u2019t showing up in the observatory\u2019s data. But after a further look, scientists realized Virgo had picked it up; the wave signal was just incredibly faint. It turned out the merger occurred in a part of the sky that is a bit of a blindspot for Virgo, which is a byproduct of the observatory\u2019s location on Earth. \u201cVirgo in a way missed it, because it happened to be in a narrow part of the sky where Virgo couldn\u2019t quite catch it,\u201d says Kalogera.\n\nBut the fact that Virgo missed it actually helped astronomers figure out where the signal was coming from: the scientists knew the exact spot in the southern sky that Virgo could not see. That knowledge, combined with the data from LIGO\u2019s two observatories, helped the collaboration to pinpoint exactly where the waves were coming from, narrowing the signal\u2019s home to a patch of sky of just 30 square degrees. That\u2019s a small sample of the night sky, which is 40,000 square degrees.\nA call to arms\nAs soon as the LIGO team suspected they had caught a new wave, text alerts were sent to astronomers around the world, telling them to get ready for a hunt. Five hours later, LIGO and Virgo shared a sky map with a general location. Seven hours after that, the aftermath of the collision had been pinpointed and the source of the gravitational waves was discovered.\ntext alerts were sent to astronomers around the world, telling them to get ready for a hunt\nThe ground-based Swope observatory in Chile saw it first, snapping images in visible light. Then other telescopes \u2014 both on the ground and in space \u2014 found it, too, measuring light from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomers gathered as much data about the event as possible, measuring everything from X-rays and ultraviolet light to infrared and radio waves. \u201cThis is the reason we all become scientists,\u201d Andy Howell, an astronomer at Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, one of the first observatories to spot the event, tells The Verge. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the feeling knowing you\u2019re one of the first people in the world to see a new phenomenon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kilonova on the first day of discovery, and four days after, as seen by the Las Campanas Observatory.\nImage: Carnegie Institution for Science\n\n\nIt\u2019ll be some time before astronomers decode everything they\u2019ve seen from these follow-up observations. But in the meantime, scientists have begun to paint a portrait of this collision using the data they\u2019ve gathered. Based on the LIGO measurements, the two neutron stars combined 130 million light-years away, much closer than the black hole mergers which occurred billions of light-years beyond Earth. And each neutron star was between 1.1 and 1.6 times the mass of our Sun, though they were probably just about 10 miles across.\nscientists have begun to paint a portrait of this collision using the data they\u2019ve gathered\nTheir resulting impact is known as a kilonova, an incredibly explosive event. The merger creates a gargantuan fireball, and the superdense materials from the two stars shoot outward in all directions. Initial light measurements from the kilonova show just how fast that material was moving, too: the outer layers of the kilonova sped away from the event at speeds close to one-third the speed of light, according to astronomers\u2019 estimates. These events aren\u2019t just explosive either; they\u2019re also thought to be factories for the production of the heaviest elements in the Universe. And the light emitted from the kilonova showed how those elements, such as gold, were produced in the wake of the merger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe locations of the three gravitational wave observatories, and the light telescopes that did follow-up observations.\nImage: LIGO-Virgo\n\n\nKilonovae have been mostly theoretical until now, and these observations confirm a lot of what astronomers expected to see during such an event \u2014 as well as opened up a few questions. \u201cTheorists have been working on kilonova for the past decade, and now with this one singular event, all this decade of work is all kind of coming to a head,\u201d Tony Piro, principal investigator of the Swope Supernova Survey, tells The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s really a momentous event.\u201d\n\u201cIt does feel good to find the source we\u2019ve always expected to find.\u201d\nAnd this is just the beginning. It\u2019s possible LIGO and Virgo saw more neutron star signals during their latest observational run, and that more could be seen in the future. The three observatories have been offline since August 25th, but engineers are working to make their instruments more sensitive to wave detection. The next observational run is slated to begin next summer, and once that starts, we could see an explosion of wave detections. For now, astronomers are basking in this latest discovery \u2014 something they\u2019ve been hoping to find for decades.\n\u201c[Finding neutron stars] was super important as the motivation for building LIGO,\u201d says Kalogera. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve finally detected them. It should not take away from our first discovery, but it does feel good to find the source we\u2019ve always expected to find.\u201d\n"}
