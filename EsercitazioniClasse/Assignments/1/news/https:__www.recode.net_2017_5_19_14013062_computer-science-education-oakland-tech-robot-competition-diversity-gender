{"title": "This Oakland high school robotics club should be the future of a more diverse tech industry", "content": " \nJust across the bay from San Francisco, a group of Oakland Technical High School students has been meeting twice a week for months, hacking away on robots slated to compete in two of the most important series of student robotics competitions in the world.\nAt Oakland Tech, around 20 high schoolers have been building robots for the Vex tournament and for the FIRST competition, where thousands of students go head to head to see which team can build the most capable machine.\nThe robots are supposed to be able to do random, albeit challenging, tasks. In this year\u2019s Vex event, which took place in January in Mountain View, Calif., at the Google Campus, the Oakland club was tasked with making a robot that can pick up small star-shaped figurines and throw them over a fence. For the local FIRST competition, which was held in San Francisco in March, the team had to build and program a robot that could pick up a cog and hang it on a peg. \n\u201cA lot of it is white, male dominated and heteronormative.\u201d\nBuilding these robots means piecing together a body, getting the motors working, then programming it to carry out an order. And it all has to work together without a hitch. It\u2019s not easy.\nWhile Oakland\u2019s team has won awards at robotics tournaments against contestants from all over the world, the team also stands out in other ways.\n\u201cWhen we go to competitions, we really don\u2019t look like the other teams that are there,\u201d said Kai Drayton-Yee, one of the leaders of Oakland Tech\u2019s robotics team, who is Chinese, Japanese and black. \u201cA lot of it is white, male dominated and heteronormative.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nOakland Tech\u2019s robotics club is led by three non-male-identified students. \n\u201cWe generally have the highest number of women on our team,\u201d said Drayton-Yee. \u201cAnd we generally have the most people of color on our team, too.\u201d \nPipeline problem\nTheir robotics club doesn\u2019t look much like a typical group of engineers in Silicon Valley, either.\nAt Google, for instance, only 1 percent of its tech employees are black, only 3 percent are Hispanic and only 19 percent of all its tech employees are women.\nLikewise, at Facebook, 1 percent of its tech employees are black, 3 percent are Hispanic and 17 percent are women, according to data released by the company last summer. In its blog post about the report, Facebook blamed a lack of available talent on what\u2019s called the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem, lamenting that there aren\u2019t enough diverse candidates entering the tech industry. \n(It\u2019s worth noting, though, that multiple reports have found there are more black and Latino computer science engineers entering the workforce than are being hired by tech companies.)\nOne likely reason for the shortage of candidates is a dearth of technology education in public schools.\nComputer science in Oakland\nComputer science education in public high schools across the country is rare, particularly in areas with high minority populations. But in Oakland, one of the most diverse cities in the country, that\u2019s changing.\nIn 2015, only three public high schools in Oakland offered computer science courses. But this school year, 14 do, out of 17 high schools district-wide.\nThere are now 2,853 Oakland public high school students enrolled in computer science, up more than three times from the 685 that were enrolled in it during the previous school year.\nOnly seven states across the country have standards for computer science in K-12 education.\nFor comparison, 10 of the 14 public high schools in San Francisco now offer computer science courses. (Though the cosmopolitan city just north of Silicon Valley has seen its overall public high school enrollment shrink after the late-1990s tech boom, as many of San Francisco\u2019s wealthy residents opted to send their kids to private schools.)\nStatewide in California, only 35 percent of high schools offer any computer science courses, according to data from the Level Playing Field Institute.\n\n\n\n\nComputer science education is also expanding across the country. Chicago offers computer science at approximately 65 of its 106 public high schools. In Los Angeles, of the city\u2019s 97 public high schools, 74 currently offer computer science courses. In Miami, all public high schools offer the courses, and in Washington, D.C., 10 of its 16 public high schools do. The data was compiled by the school districts for Recode.\nPrivate money, public education\nThe computer science expansion at Oakland high schools was funded in part by a $5 million grant from Intel to grow the programs over the next five years. By 2018, the district plans for every public high school in Oakland to offer computer engineering courses. Now that it is part of Oakland\u2019s core academic requirements, every freshman is required to take computer science if it\u2019s offered at their school. \nBut nationwide, only seven states have standards for computer science in K-12 education, according to data from the nonprofit Code.org, and only 32 states allow computer science to count toward high school graduation \u2014 otherwise it\u2019s an elective.\n\u201cHundreds of students across the district will now be creating applications and hardware projects, like robotics or websites,\u201d said Claire Shorall, who teaches calculus and computer science at Castlemont High School in Oakland and spearheaded the school district\u2019s computer science expansion. \u201cI think what we\u2019re going to see are ideas that haven\u2019t yet entered the market, because students from diverse backgrounds will create things we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\u201cForty-five percent of all computer science students in Oakland Unified are young women, and our numbers for African American and Latino students far exceed what we see in the tech workforce,\u201d Shorall said.\nMost of the Oakland school district\u2019s computer science teachers started as teachers in other areas and were trained up to teach the new courses. And most of those teachers leading Oakland\u2019s computer science classes are people of color, too, which Shorall says makes it easier for students from underrepresented communities to envision themselves entering tech jobs.\n\n\nSubscribe to the Recode newsletter\nSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\nYour email\n\n\nGo\n\n\n    By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n"}
