{"content": " \nIs Texas senator and former candidate for the Republican Party's 2016 presidential nomination Ted Cruz the Zodiac Killer? The question lingers in the minds of the American people, but today we must gather to discuss his involvement in a crime that took place on Twitter. Here\u2019s what we know: \nThe victim: \u201cTed Cruz is the Zodiac Killer\u201d meme\nThe evidence: In 2013, a theory began circulating online that Ted Cruz may, in fact, be the unmasked Zodiac Killer \u2014 a mass murderer whose identity has long remained a mystery. The rumor picked up steam leading up to the 2016 election; alleged evidence for this claim is bountiful. The Verge walked through the theory at length ahead of the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCruz himself has never denied these claims. In May, his wife Heidi went to bat for him, telling Yahoo News that it\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d how many people have been swayed by the rumor. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been married to him for 15 years, and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of garbage out there.\u201d Which is not directly denying the rumors either, but instead implying she\u2019s totally cool with it. I guess that\u2019s true love. \nRecently, during the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Ben Sasse, (R-NE), reportedly spilled Dr. Pepper on Cruz. Sasse later apologized for the disruption. \nAt 1PM, Cruz\u2019s Twitter account posted a photo of a Dr. Pepper-filled fridge and declared Sasse \u201ccut off.\u201d\nAt 1:52PM, Cruz followed up his previous Sasse mention with a direct tweet to the senator. It included no words, just an image Google refers to as \u201cbest guess for this image: zodiac killer letters.\u201d It certainly does match the very specific, coded letters we know to be sent from the killer, and has the killer\u2019s symbol-signature. \n\n\n\n pic.twitter.com/CRKdrSDWes\u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 18, 2017\n\n\n\nCruz is not funny or good at jokes, though humorous things often happen around him. Like when his account liked a porn tweet.\nThe outcome: The murder of a beloved meme, revived by a government official as a thinly veiled, presumably humorous threat against another government official.\nIs all this evidence circumstantial? I\u2019ve only ever heard that term used in crime dramas, so I don\u2019t actually know. As one of my colleagues so poignantly observed, \u201cthe \u2018Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer\u2019 meme caught fire bc everyone believes that Ted Cruz is loathsome enough to murder people.\u201d Cruz, he says, is therefore leaning into this joke about him being a bloodthirsty psychopath. Would anyone else besides the real Zodiac Killer do this? I cannot say for sure. But by the powers vested in me by no one in particular, I\u2019m issuing a ruling.\nThe verdict: Ted Cruz is guilty of the death of the \u201cTed Cruz is the Zodiac Killer\u201d meme. \n", "title": "Did Ted Cruz just kill the best Ted Cruz joke?"}
