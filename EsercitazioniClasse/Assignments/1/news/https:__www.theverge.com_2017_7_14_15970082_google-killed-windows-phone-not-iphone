{"title": "Android killed Windows Phone, not Apple", "content": " \nSo Windows Phone is well and truly dead (excepting a tiny handful of Windows 10 devices). There it lies, buried in the graveyard of failed smartphone platforms. Cause of death: Android. Yes, really.\nApple changed everything in mobile, but in the chaotic years after its release, there was a massive opportunity to be the alternative that would ultimately dominate marketshare. It was Microsoft\u2019s for the taking, but Google got there first.\nI started reflecting on what happened to these smartphones as the 10th anniversary of the iPhone came and went. And the thought that kept occurring to me is how little everybody knew about what was about to happen to the smartphone industry before the iPhone came along.  Nobody knew what they didn\u2019t know.\nThat led to some hilarious quotes from competitors that are easy to mock now. BlackBerry CEO Jim Balsillie\u2019s \u201cin terms of a sort of a sea-change for BlackBerry, I would think that\u2019s overstating it.\" Palm CEO Ed Colligan\u2019s \u201cPC guys are not going to just figure this out. They\u2019re not going to just walk in.\u201d Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer\u2019s \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appeal to business customers because it doesn\u2019t have a keyboard.\u201d  \nAfter they said those things, all of those CEOs tried (and failed) to adequately respond to the iPhone. BlackBerry duct-taped extra software on its aging platform and tried to make the whole screen a giant button. Palm made a go of it with webOS but couldn\u2019t get carrier support, nor make products good enough for consumers to go out and buy their devices. \n\nMicrosoft\u2019s response was Windows 6.5, a hack on an old OS that wasn\u2019t designed for full touchscreen devices. Then Windows Phone 7, which was an admirable reboot with genuinely new design ideas. It came too late, though, and floundered. Windows Phone 8 took a bad situation and made it worse by angering Microsoft\u2019s surprisingly passionate fanbase when they learned existing devices wouldn\u2019t get software upgrades. (The same thing happened with Windows Phone 10, though by then it hardly mattered.)\nOh yeah, one more thing: somewhere in there Microsoft bought Nokia and frittered away the most storied and trusted phone brand in history. Cool job.\nSo while Microsoft didn\u2019t do itself any favors, I\u2019d argue strongly that all these machinations and flailings weren\u2019t a response (or weren\u2019t only a response) to the iPhone. The real enemy was the company that had set its sights on Microsoft\u2019s phone ambitions since before the iPhone was released. \nThat company was Google, of course, and it only tangentially wanted to take on the iPhone. Google\u2019s real target was always Microsoft, and it hit the bullseye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s \u2018Sooner\u2019 prototype, killed by the iPhone\nSteven Troughton-Smith\n\n\nThe best window into what Google was thinking about when it was creating Android is the 2012 legal fight it had with Oracle about Java. The deeply nerdy API details of that case don\u2019t really matter now, but the process of a public, protracted court battle gives us a special and unique gift: testimony and documents. \nHere\u2019s some of what then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, had to say about the creation of Android:\n\nQ. And once Android came aboard and Mr. Rubin came aboard, was there a business strategy formed about what Android would be and how it worked?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Can you tell the jurors about that? What was it?\nA. My recollection was that the the strategy that evolved over the first year, which would be roughly 2000 and \u2014 2006, was to build a platform \u2014 which, again, we previously discussed -- that would be free and clear of some of the other licensing restrictions that were slowing down the industry, and that would, in fact, create a viable alternative to the then key players at the time. As you've earlier seen in the documents.\nSo our idea was that if we made something that was generally available, it would provide a lot of customer value; it could be a very large platform; and it would grow very quickly. All of which has, indeed, occurred.\nQ: When you say open or alternative to what was out there, tell our jurors what you mean by that.\nA. Well, at the time, we were quite concerned about Microsoft's products. It's hard to relate to that now, but at the time we were very concerned that Microsoft's mobile strategy would be successful.\nIt's also true at the time that the primary player in the industry was Nokia, who had an operating system called Symbian, which we were also concerned about.\nThis was before the iPhone was announced and before the whole iPhone revolution occurred.\n\n\u201cHoly crap, I guess we\u2019re not going to ship that phone.\u201d\nThis all sounds awfully precious now, with the benefit of hindsight. The very idea that Google was terrified of Windows Mobile is hard to wrap your head around. After all, we all know that was the iPhone that changed everything in mobile, it was the iPhone that made all those other companies launch half-cocked jerry-rigged products as a stopgap before remaking their platforms later on. \nIndeed, that happened with Android, too. Andy Rubin famously revamped Android\u2019s launch plan when we saw the original iPhone presentation:\n\nRubin was so astonished by what Jobs was unveiling that, on his way to a meeting, he had his driver pull over so that he could finish watching the webcast.\n\u201cHoly crap,\u201d he said to one of his colleagues in the car. \u201cI guess we\u2019re not going to ship that phone.\u201d\n\nBut go back to Schmidt in that trial for a second. The thing he and Google\u2019s other executives were worried about was ensuring that mobile users continued to have access to Google search. He saw clearly that there would end up being a software platform that lots of different manufacturers would license and use to make phones, and he wanted Google to be on it.\nRather than trust Microsoft and Nokia and everybody else to keep their platforms open to them, Google just went ahead and made the open platform itself. And then it released it to anybody to use for free, undercutting Microsoft\u2019s licensing fee for Windows Mobile.\nWhat killed Windows Phone was getting beat to market by Android. It took way too long for Microsoft to release a viable competitor to the iPhone - it didn\u2019t really land until 2010. By then, Android had already been around for two years and Verizon was selling the Droid for a year.\nBack then, despite the disruption in the market that the iPhone brought, US carriers still had the power to determine winners and losers. And since only AT&T had the iPhone, the other three in the US were casting about for their competitive product. Verizon, in particular, was going to be the kingmaker. \n\nIn 2008, Verizon tapped BlackBerry\u2019s Storm, which was a colossal failure. In 2009, Verizon looked at what else was around. Palm hadn\u2019t been able to convince Verizon to pick up the Palm Pre and Windows Phone 7 was still a year off. So Verizon went all in on Droid and the rest is history.\nThis is obviously an oversimplified timeline. Nokia woulda-coulda-shoulda made a move, for example. Palm and BlackBerry and everybody else made enough mistakes to fill books. \nBut in mobile, there\u2019s no greater woulda-coulda-shoulda than Windows Phone. Everything that made Android successful was stuff that Microsoft was basically already trying to do. It\u2019s just that Microsoft did it not quite as well, not quite as free, and way too late. \n\n"}
