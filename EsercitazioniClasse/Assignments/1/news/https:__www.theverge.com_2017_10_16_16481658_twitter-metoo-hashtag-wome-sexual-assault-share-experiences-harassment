{"title": "Thousands of women share experiences of sexual assault on Twitter through #MeToo", "content": " \nWomen across Twitter and other social media platforms are sharing their experiences of sexual assault and harassment using the hashtag #MeToo, after actress Alyssa Milano suggested the idea in a post on Twitter last night. The outpouring of stories comes in the wake of several high-profile investigative reports from The New York Times and The New Yorker into decades of sexual assault and harassment from Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Many women quickly responded to Milano\u2019s tweet, which said: \u201cIf all women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote \u2018Me too.\u2019 as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.\u201d\nSome responded to her tweet with just \u201cMe too,\u201d including True Blood actress Anna Paquin. Others detailed their own experiences. One person wrote, \u201cThe first time I was sexually assaulted, I was 13 years old. The last time it happened was 1 month ago, at work. I\u2019m 52 yrs old. #Metoo.\u201d\n\n\nMe too\u2014 Anna Paquin (@AnnaPaquin) October 15, 2017\n\n\n\nMen also voiced their support, including comedy writer Nick Jack Pappas, who wrote, \u201cMen, don\u2019t say you have a mother, a sister, a daughter... Say you have a father, a brother, a son who can do better. We all can.\u201d Milano starred with fellow actress Rose McGowan in the late-\u201990s series Charmed. McGowan was temporarily blocked from Twitter last week for condemning Weinstein and those who have worked with him. (One post read \u201cBen Affleck fuck off.\u201d) McGowan reached a settlement with Weinstein over undisclosed claims in 1997, according to the Times.\nSince the publication of the reports, Weinstein has been fired from The Weinstein Company and dismissed from the Academy. Amazon Studios has also cut ties with Weinstein, and more women have come out detailing their harassment experiences with the producer, including actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Cara Delevingne.\n"}
