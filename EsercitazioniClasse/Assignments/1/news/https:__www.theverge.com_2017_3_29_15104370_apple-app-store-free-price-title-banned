{"title": "Apple now forbids apps to mention price in their name", "content": " \nFor a long time, iOS and Mac developers have published apps on the App Store which reference the software\u2019s price in the title. It may seem a little crude to write \u201c[Your App Name Here] \u2014 Free [App Function],\u201d but it puts important information where users can easily see it. (And the word \u201cFree\u201d is more enticing than the word \u201cGet,\u201d which Apple uses for its free-to-download apps.) Now, though, the iPhone-maker is cracking down on this practice, which it\u2019s long discouraged.\nAccording to a report from VentureBeat, submitting an app to the App Store or Mac App Store with the word \u201cFree\u201d in the title now earns you a rejection, and this response: \n\nYour app\u2019s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app\u2019s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items.\nPlease remove any references to your app\u2019s price from your app\u2019s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app\u2019s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app\u2019s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect.\n\nApple confirmed the newly enforced policy (which also applies to screenshots of apps) to VentureBeat and AppleInsider. However, it\u2019s not clear if or when existing apps which mention price in their title will also be forced to change. Google\u2019s iOS Drive app, for example, is listed on the App Store as \u201cGoogle Drive \u2014 free online storage.\u201d \n"}
