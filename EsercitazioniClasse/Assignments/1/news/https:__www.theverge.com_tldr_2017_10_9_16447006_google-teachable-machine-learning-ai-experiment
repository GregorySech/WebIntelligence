{"title": "Google's new browser experiment lets you learn about basic AI", "content": " \nJust how does machine learning work? You\u2019ve probably read a primer or two on the subject, but often the best way to understand a thing is to try it out for yourself. With that in mind, check out this little in-browser experiment from Google named Teachable Machine. It\u2019s a perfect two-minute summary of what a lot of modern AI can \u2014 and more importantly can\u2019t \u2014 do. \nTeachable Machine lets you use your webcam to train an extremely basic AI program. Just hit the \u201ctrain green/purple/orange\u201d buttons, and the machine will record whatever it can see through your webcam. Once it\u2019s \u201clearned\u201d enough, it\u2019ll output whatever you like (a GIF or a sound effect or some speech) when it sees the object or activity you trained it with. I taught it to recognize my houseplants and respond with relevant GIFs, but others have used it make their hands go moo or play air guitar on command. \n\nAll this is pretty fun, but it also demonstrates some fundamental aspects of machine learning. First, that programs like these learn by example. They look, they find patterns, and they remember them. Second, they need a lot of examples to learn from. And third, and most importantly, their understanding of the world is superficial and easily broken. \nEarlier, for example, I said that I \u201ctaught\u201d the machine to recognize my houseplants. The truth is that I only taught it to recognize a vaguely green and fuzzy array of pixels. It doesn\u2019t see my asparagus fern and think (like I do): \u201cAh, this needs keeping out of sunlight and semi-frequent watering. I wonder why millennials are drawn to houseplants in the first place? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s because they can\u2019t afford houses, but also hashtag urban jungle, I guess.\u201d All the machine knows is the pixels it can see, and any extra information has to be programmed in. \nAll this is worth remembering the next time you\u2019re reading about machine learning or artificial intelligence. Yes, the field has made huge, huge strides in recent years, but as we\u2019re seeing more and more, the algorithms being created are nowhere near as clever as we\u2019d like them to be. In other words, they\u2019re still learning. \n"}
