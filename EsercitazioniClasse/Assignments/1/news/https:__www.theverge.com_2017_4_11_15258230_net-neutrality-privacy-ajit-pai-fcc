{"title": "The FCC\u2019s plan to kill net neutrality will also kill internet privacy", "content": " \nAfter Congress repealed the FCC\u2019s broadband privacy rules two weeks ago, new FCC chairman Ajit Pai promised the American people that he would ensure that the personal information they give to their ISPs would continue to be protected. Pai said that he planned to work with the Federal Trade Commission to \u201crestore the FTC\u2019s authority to police internet service providers\u2019 privacy practices.\u201d \nBut this plan will not only fail to provide effective broadband privacy protections, it will come at the cost of eliminating the FCC\u2019s net neutrality rules that prohibit ISPs like Comcast and AT&T from picking winners and losers on the internet. And there\u2019s a real chance the FTC actually won\u2019t be able to regulate ISPs at all.\nHow the FTC can police internet providers\nThe FTC currently lacks the legal authority to oversee any unfair and deceptive ISP practices, including privacy, because of a part of the Federal Trade Commission Act known as the \u201ccommon carrier exemption.\u201d \nA common carrier is a service that carries traffic without discrimination or interference, like telephone service. Prior to 2002, the FTC didn\u2019t police either telephone companies or ISPs. In 2002, a determination by George W. Bush\u2019s FCC that ISPs were not common carriers brought them within the scope of the FTC\u2019s authority. Then, the Obama FCC\u2019s 2015 decision to reclassify ISPs as common carriers put ISPs back under FCC oversight \u2014 the decision that also enabled the FCC to adopt the strongest-ever net neutrality rules as well as protect consumers from fraudulent billing, price gouging, and other harmful ISP practices. \nPai\u2019s plan is to kill net neutrality\nThe only way Pai can restore the FTC\u2019s authority over broadband would be to reverse the FCC\u2019s 2015 decision reclassifying ISPs as common carriers. If that happens, the net neutrality rules and the FCC\u2019s ability to protect consumers and competition in the broadband market would no longer be valid. \nAs reported by several news outlets, this is exactly what Pai plans to do. \nIn place of the net neutrality rules, ISPs would commit to several (but not all) net neutrality \u201cprinciples\u201d in their terms of service \u2014 no discrimination, no blocking, no \u201charmful\u201d paid prioritization. (Which is interesting, since the Wheeler FCC has found that paid prioritization is inherently harmful.) \nPai would make these fundamental changes without public input\nPlacing these commitments in their terms of service would give the FTC the ability to bring an enforcement action if an ISP did not live up to those promises. Some reports even suggest that Pai would make these fundamental changes without first providing an opportunity for public input.\nNilay Patel has explained why such a plan is, in his words, \u201cnonsense\u201d: terms of service change all the time; there are hundreds of small rural ISPs that are unlikely to be covered by this pledge; the FTC can only bring so many enforcement actions, and so on. Another name for the Pai Plan might be \u201cJust Trust Us.\u201d Hardly a comforting thought in a market where ISPs face little competition and serve as the sole gatekeeper to the internet.\nPai\u2019s plan will also get rid of privacy protections\nAnd despite his promises, the Pai plan won\u2019t restore the privacy protections the FCC\u2019s rules would have provided. The now-canceled FCC rules would have prohibited an ISP from selling, sharing or otherwise using your browsing history and applications usage unless you affirmatively gave permission for that use. The FTC\u2019s legal framework does not require affirmative opt-in consent for browsing history and app usage. A provider would only have to let you opt-out \u2014 something that consumers rarely do and which companies routinely make it hard to do. And importantly, while the FCC\u2019s rules would have protected consumers before they were harmed, the FTC can only act after harm has already occurred.  \nISPs that provide mobile or fixed telephone service would be completely exempt from FTC oversight\nEven worse, because of a recent decision from a Federal Appeals Court in California, the FTC can\u2019t prohibit the vast majority of ISPs from sharing or selling your personal information at all. That decision says that if a company provides a common carrier service, the FTC cannot enforce its laws against any of its services, even if they are non-common carrier services like video or online news. So ISPs that also provide mobile or fixed telephone service \u2014 which is pretty much all of them \u2014 would be completely exempt from FTC oversight. If the case stands (it is currently on appeal), then the Pai plan will deprive consumers of both net neutrality and broadband privacy protections.  \n\nI think the Trump FCC should keep the FCC\u2019s 2015 net neutrality and ISP classification decision intact. At a bare minimum, however, the FCC should not start a proceeding to reverse them unless and until the 9th Circuit decision is reversed. \nAmericans will once again make their voices heard if net neutrality is threatened\nA remarkable letter sent to Pai by 50 Republican House members on Friday demonstrates the political perils of leaving consumers\u2019 personal information unprotected. Despite the fact that just two weeks ago the House voted to repeal the FCC\u2019s broadband privacy rules, these House members urge Pai to continue to protect consumer privacy until such time as he completes his plan to repeal net neutrality. The letter, sent on the day before member of Congress have to face angry voters during recess, should serve as a cautionary tale. The American people wanted the freedom to decide how their ISP uses their personal information \u2014 they didn\u2019t want Congress to give it to giant internet providers. \nSimilarly, the American people want the freedom to decide where to go and what do with their internet connection. They don\u2019t want the FCC to give it to giant internet providers. If the past several days are any indication, if net neutrality is threatened, Americans will once again make their voices heard.\nGigi Sohn served as Counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler from November 2013 to December 2016.\n"}
