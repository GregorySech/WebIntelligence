{"title": "Apple\u2019s latest iPhone ad is a love note to Earth", "content": " \nApple\u2019s newest ad features an array of short clips, shot on iPhone by regular users, underscored by the calming voice of astronomer Carl Sagan. The crisp and clear clips \u2014 of forests, beaches, and mountains, of insects and birds \u2014 serve to advertise the smartphone\u2019s camera, certainly, but the choice of natural imagery and Carl Sagan\u2019s voiceover feel like a pointed message in the wake Donald Trump\u2019s decision to back out of the Paris environmental agreement. \nThe fact we only have one livable planet \u201cunderscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve, and cherish, the only home we\u2019ve ever known,\u201d Sagan says, an excerpt from his classic Pale Blue Dot. \u201cThere is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to where our species could migrate.\u201d They\u2019re words that scientists would say should be remembered as the United States\u2019 government backs out on promises to battle climate change. \nApple CEO Tim Cook has said as much, criticizing Donald Trump\u2019s decision both in public and private. Cook reportedly called the White House in a bid to urge the president not to back out of the Paris deal. When his pleas fell on deaf ears, Cook made statements both to his employees, and to the public in an interview with Bloomberg, saying that Trump should have stayed with the deal. \n"}
