 Welcome back to Circuit Breaker Live: the not-quite live edition. In case you missed our show yesterday — it streams live on Twitter every Tuesday at 4PM ET / 1PM PT — we’ve recorded the whole thing and have it ready for playback above. This week, we have Ashley Carman discussing the instant camera revival, Lauren Goode talking about the Apple Watch Series 3 and other wearables, and myself testing out some of the latest smart speakers, including the brand new Echo.The show is every bit as good today as it was on Tuesday. Just don’t expect a live response when you tweet at us. You’ll have to wait until next week.In case you missed it, you can also check out last week’s episode, where we talked Pixel 2 and party speakers.
