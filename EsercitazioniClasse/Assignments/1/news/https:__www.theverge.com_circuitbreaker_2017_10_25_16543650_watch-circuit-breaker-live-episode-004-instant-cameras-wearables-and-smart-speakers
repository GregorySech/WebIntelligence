In case you missed our show yesterday \u2014 it streams live on Twitter every Tuesday at 4PM ET / 1PM PT \u2014 we\u2019ve recorded the whole thing and have it ready for playback above. This week, we have Ashley Carman discussing the instant camera revival, Lauren Goode talking about the Apple Watch Series 3 and other wearables, and myself testing out some of the latest smart speakers, including the brand new Echo.\nThe show is every bit as good today as it was on Tuesday. Just don\u2019t expect a live response when you tweet at us. You\u2019ll have to wait until next week.\nIn case you missed it, you can also check out last week\u2019s episode, where we talked Pixel 2 and party speakers.\n"}
