{"title": "Bros are oblivious in SNL\u2019s parody of Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale", "content": " \nLast night, Saturday Night Live parodied Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale with a short sketch featuring a group of handmaids who come across a group of bros that they knew in their former lives. While the lives of the women (formerly known as Girl Squad) have drastically changed, the men\u2019s lives haven\u2019t.\nChris Pine\u2019s stereotypical bro and a friend encounter the group of women, and only vaguely remember society drastically changing. Pine offers up a weak excuse: \u201cI think I actually read something about that, but I\u2019ve been super busy at work lately.\u201d No matter how much the women try and explain what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s clear that the guys are aren\u2019t really paying attention. \n\u201cYou guys should like, fight back.\u201d\nInstead, they offer up some vague and extremely unhelpful suggestions: \u201cYou guys should like, fight back,\u201d Pine\u2019s bro friend says, while Pine says that they should drop his entertainment lawyer father an email, and is offended when one of the handmaids says that they can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t actually care that much, even though one of them \u201cmeant to go\u201d to that protest a while back. When the women are dragged off, they just shrug and complain that they\u2019ll probably flake on their invitation to hang out.\nIt\u2019s an entertaining sketch (Pine makes for a convincing bro, and SNL\u2019s tagline for Hulu \u2014 \u201cSee Netflix, we have one, too\u201d \u2014 is hilarious), but it\u2019s uncannily true to life. There have been plenty of examples where men have been completely oblivious to the systemic problems that women face, and this sketch shows that the Republic of Gilead probably won\u2019t be all that different. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nChris Pine went on SNL to clear up superhero movie he\u2019s actually in\n\n\n"}
