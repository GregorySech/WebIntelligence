Thanks to a tweet published last night, fans can now expect the evil ranger to make an appearance in the nigh-inevitable Power Rangers sequel.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/JMgzVJFYUH\u2014 Power Rangers (@PowerRangers) March 23, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Green Ranger is the alter ego of Tommy Oliver (Jason David Frank), who made his Mighty Morphin\u2019 Power Rangers series debut back in 1993 during the five-part \u201cGreen with Evil\u201d miniseries. Originally conceived as an evil nemesis for the five original Rangers, the character eventually returned and joined the team as its sixth Ranger. He\u2019d go on to become one of the most iconic Rangers in the entire franchise. \nGiven his status among fans, Green Ranger\u2019s arrival was almost certainly inevitable. And he\u2019ll likely have plenty of opportunity to show off his skills (at least until the White Ranger shows up). According to Variety, producer Haim Saban has plans for five more follow-ups, so long as today\u2019s release does well. \u201cIf this film is as successful as I hope on March 24,\u201d he said, \u201con March 25 we\u2019ll have the first story meeting for Movie No. 2.\u201d\n"}
