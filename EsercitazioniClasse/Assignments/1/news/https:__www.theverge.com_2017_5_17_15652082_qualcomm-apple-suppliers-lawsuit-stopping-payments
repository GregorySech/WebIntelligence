{"title": "Qualcomm sues Apple suppliers amid global patent battle", "content": " \nQualcomm is suing the four companies Apple uses to make iPhones and iPads for failing to provide royalty payments, after they received instructions from Apple not to pay.\nThe lawsuit names Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal, all of which Qualcomm says have stopped paying royalties for patented technologies used in Apple\u2019s products.\nApple instructed the four companies not to pay while it litigated a patent fight \u2014 which includes lawsuits in the US, China, and England \u2014 against Qualcomm. Apple says Qualcomm has been abusing its position as the dominant supplier of smartphone modems to charge unreasonably high rates to license its patents. Evidently, it\u2019s hoping not to pay until a judge weighs in.\nQualcomm says Apple agreed to cover lawsuit costs for its suppliers\nQualcomm is now attempting to flip the script, with the company\u2019s general counsel, Don Rosenberg, saying that Apple is abusing its position \u201cas the wealthiest company in the world to try to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms.\u201d\nAsked for comment, Apple pointed to a statement made by CEO Tim Cook during a recent earnings call. Qualcomm, Cook said, is \u201ctrying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value\u201d when its technology is only \u201cone small part of what an iPhone is.\u201d In an earlier statement, Apple said it had been trying to negotiate with Qualcomm for five years and that it had finally decided to withhold payments \u201cuntil the correct amount can be determined by the court.\u201d\nThe string of lawsuits kicked off with what could pose an even bigger problem for Qualcomm: a lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission, which accused Qualcomm abusing its market position much like Apple has claimed. Samsung and Intel both filed briefs earlier this week backing the FTC.\nQualcomm claims that Apple agreed to cover any monetary damages its suppliers incur for refusing to pay royalties and potentially breaching their contracts with Qualcomm. Asked for confirmation, an Apple spokesperson said \u201cI'm not aware that's strictly correct.\u201d\nIf Apple is covering some of the damages, it would mean Qualcomm is using this latest lawsuit not just as a way to recover lost payments, but as an attempt to get back at Apple. Qualcomm says it\u2019s already filed a separate claim against Apple directly for \u201cunlawful interference\u201d with its licensing agreements.\nThe withheld payments pose a $500 million problem for Qualcomm in this quarter alone. After learning that Apple\u2019s suppliers were refusing to pay up, Qualcomm had to lower its revenue guidance for the quarter, and similar dips could show up each coming segment until this legal battle is played out.\nUpdate May 17th, 10:59AM ET: This story has been updated to include comments from Apple.\n"}
