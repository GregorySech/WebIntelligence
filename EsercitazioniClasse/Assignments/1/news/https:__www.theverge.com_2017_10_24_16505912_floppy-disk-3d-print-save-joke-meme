{"title": "Why is this floppy disk joke still haunting the internet?", "content": " \nThere\u2019s a joke that circulates online every few years. It\u2019s a picture of a floppy disk, accompanied by the claim that a kid thought it was a real-life version of the \u201csave\u201d icon. Every time it pops up, people laugh, hit \u201clike,\u201d and marvel both at their own age and the cluelessness of kids today.\nOver the last week, this gag has been making the rounds on Twitter yet again, thanks to a user under the name Bill Gross. His tweet went viral, with more than 174K retweets to date. The catch? There is no smart-mouthed kid in this equation. Gross was just repeating a laugh he\u2019d once enjoyed. \n\n\nIn the \"I'm getting old\" department.., a kid saw this and said, \"oh, you 3D-printed the 'Save' Icon.\" pic.twitter.com/rwgCpSjfDQ\u2014 Bill Gross (@Bill_Gross) October 17, 2017\n\n\n\nGross, the founder of a tech incubator, was watching a talk by Michael Wolf at the WSJ D.Live Conference, when he started pondering the progression of technology. While he was live-tweeting the event, the disk image drifted through his timeline. \u201cI looked at it, and it brought back memories for me of my first floppies, multimedia PCs, and it made me feel a bit old,\u201d he tells The Verge. He grabbed a new picture of a floppy disk, added his own spin, and hit Tweet.\nGross considered his message as more of a meme than a literal report of something that happened to him, though he admits he has no idea how this goof got started. Old iterations of the floppy disk meme are not hard to find. The oldest instance I\u2019ve been able to dig up, circa a forum post in January 2014, comes from an unidentified web comic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, brands on Twitter have co-opted it in their usual attempt to be trendy. Tech bros have gleefully shared it with #humor hashtags. It\u2019s even made its way into PowerPoint presentations, which of course have then been recycled for Twitter content. It\u2019s appeared online in spaces like Reddit or Imgur. It even got a shoutout in a textbook. \nThe world is not full of clueless children repeating the same awed observation, though. It\u2019s more likely that adults are just regurgitating an old joke. Floppy disks are dead technology; that\u2019s hardly a new revelation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why this meme resonates so much,\u201d Gross says, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s maybe because people have nostalgia about this time, and also it\u2019s funny how the icon on the desktop survived so long after the floppy died.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a well-established fascination with antiquated tech and other bygones of people\u2019s youth. From media outlets to daytime TV shows, people love to examine the pass\u00e9 things these darn kids today \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d: broken records, typewriters, landlines and telephone booths, the dial-up sound on the first modems, and so forth. YouTuber channels like FBE (formerly The Fine Bros) have built entire followings off this curiosity with their \u201cKids React\u201d series.  \n\nThere\u2019s comfort in laughing at what kids today don\u2019t know, because it suggests that those of us old enough to remember such marvels are not obsolete after all. There\u2019s little reason for a kid to recognize a floppy disk for what it actually is, but we can pass our aging awareness off as intellectual superiority and rich life experience. Gross may be the latest, most popular example of the joke, but it\u2019s doubtful he\u2019ll be the last. The floppy disk lives on as technical shorthand instead of a physical object \u2014 that is, until everyone rightfully adopts the \u201cctrl/command + S\u201d shortcut.\n"}
