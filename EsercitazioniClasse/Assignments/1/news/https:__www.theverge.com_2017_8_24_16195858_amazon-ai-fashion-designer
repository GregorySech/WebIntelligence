{"title": "Amazon\u2019s new algorithm designs clothing by analyzing a bunch of pictures", "content": " \nAmazon has developed an algorithm that can design clothing by analyzing a bunch of images to copy the style and then apply it to new items generated from scratch, reports MIT. Amazon is focussing heavily on fashion, and has previously said it\u2019s looking to become \u201cthe best place to buy fashion online,\u201d so designing its own pieces pinned to current trends seems like a logical move. \nThe algorithm was developed by Amazon Lab 126, the company\u2019s research and development hub and uses a tool called generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN is a new technique in AI research that forces two neural networks against one another, using the outcome to improve the overall system. It learns from raw data \u2014 so by looking at a batch of images, it can draw out a style. That could mean spotting a particular trend on Instagram, Facebook, or its own collection of fashion imagery generated by the company\u2019s new Echo Look cameras.\nIt\u2019s the latest step by Amazon to further its clout in the fashion space. Imagine it: Amazon spots a trend and then quickly design clothes via AI that can be produced on-demand. Amazon\u2019s reach coupled with consumer desire for cheap, trendy clothes could one day create the clothing juggernaut of every clothing retailer\u2019s nightmare.\n\n"}
