{"title": "Despite the smartwatch, the clock hasn't stopped for mechanical watches", "content": " \nThe past few years haven\u2019t been great for the luxury watch market. Economic downturns, currency devaluations, and the development of the smartwatch \u2014 once poised to be the next major tech sector following the smartphone and tablet \u2014 helped usher in two years of declines in sales and profits for the Swiss watch industry. The common narrative was that the watch industry was being killed by smartwatches and was ultimately doomed. But much like the introduction of quartz watches in the \u201870s, which nearly decimated the luxury watch market, Switzerland rebounded and is now growing once again. \nThe smartwatch industry, on the other hand, is going through growing pains. Apple still sells millions of Apple Watches, but major players like Motorola have stopped making smartwatches indefinitely, while traditional watchmakers like Tag Heuer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant have released hybrid smartwatches \u2014 traditional dials with hidden smarts \u2014 pushing the market back to a more familiar design aesthetic.\nIf there\u2019s anything that has become clear since the initial launch of smartwatches four years ago \u2014 followed quickly by the decline of the industry into what\u2019s essentially a monopoly \u2014 it\u2019s that traditional watches aren\u2019t going anywhere. But how did the Swiss market become the only major sector to withstand an attack of \u201cinnovation\u201d from the technology industry in the last 15 years? Different market segments, the ubiquity of smartphones, and the history and timeless nature of a well-made mechanical watch.\nThe Swiss watch market has rebounded and is growing once again\nMarket segments is the easiest point to clarify. Most of the successful smartwatches have hovered around the $300 mark: the Moto 360 ($299), Samsung Gear S3 ($349), and Apple Watch ($369) all start at less than $400. The average sale price for luxury watches in March was $746, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Apple has already given up on its high-end gold Apple Watch line which started at $10,000, replacing it with a ceramic version for a tenth of the price. While Apple does offer its Watch at prices above $700, if you\u2019re buying it for function rather than form, what is the point of spending extra? Smartwatches and traditional watches may share a surname, a design style, and a place on the wrist, but their audiences do not match one to one.\nIf you flip that, however, putting form above function, and sprinkle in some history and product longevity, you have the recipe as to why the luxury watch market won\u2019t meet its demise anytime soon. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL to R: Martenero Edgemere, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant Flyback Chronograph Manufacture, Omega Speedmaster Grey Side of the Moon.\n\n\n\nI spent time with three traditional, mechanical timepieces: a Martenero Edgemere, a Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant Flyback Chronograph Manufacture, and an Omega Speedmaster Grey Side of the Moon. All three watches feature automatic movements, leather straps, and power reserves that will maintain the proper time for at least a day and a half without movement. But that is where the similarities end. Ranging in price from $550 to $12,000, these three timepieces imbue the major reasons why the Swiss watch market will continue, despite challenges from the tech industry. \nThe Martenero Edgemere is the most affordable watch out of the three (perhaps because it\u2019s not actually Swiss), coming in at $550. It includes subtle details that make the piece feel much more elegant than a watch in its price range usually does. Available in four different colorways, it features a raised hour ring, textured interior, and a sub dial at the 4.5 position which houses the second hand. It\u2019s powered by a Japanese Miyota 8245 movement, utilizes a domed sapphire crystal, and is one of the few watches that are hand-assembled in the US.\nThe Edgemere is the type of watch Apple and its cohorts are looking to take down\nIt\u2019s an excellent spring to summer timepiece, casually distinct in its own way with a comfortable handmade leather strap. \u201cWe came up with something that I think is our strongest design to date,\u201d Martenero CEO John Tarantino told me. \u201cWe tried to create a modern-day, nautical-themed watch that is more about capturing that aesthetic, and there were certain design cues that we pulled from marine chronometers as well. It is definitely a little bit more colorful and a little bit more whimsical than the other stuff that we\u2019ve done. But there\u2019s actually a very complex construction behind that design.\u201d\nThe Edgemere is the type of watch Apple and its cohorts are looking to take down. But Martenero says he has seen no effect on its sales since the emergence of the smartwatch, likely because it appeals to a different segment of the population. If you\u2019re in the market for a watch like the Edgemere, you\u2019re likely to have more than one watch to wear based on different events and seasons. That just doesn\u2019t work for a smartwatch. The ability to swap bands isn\u2019t the same as the option to completely change models without having a worse user experience, which you can\u2019t easily do with smartwatches without losing fitness data and other features.\nThen you have the audience who enjoys (or tries to enjoy) disconnecting from their smartphones. Smartwatches don\u2019t help in that cause. \u201cI feel like, if anything, there has been an effort of people I know to check their phone less, to tune out notifications, and to take short breaks,\u201d Tarantino said. \u201cLike hour-long breaks from their phone. The [smart]watch\u2026 is sort of going against that trend or that desire that people have just to take short little digital breaks.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant is the company hovering in that middle ground. The company has been known for making luxurious yet affordable watches for years, but recently it has become one of the major players in the smartwatch game, introducing nine models in the last year. But unlike most of the gadget companies, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant went with the hybrid model, a traditional dial with an embedded smart chip, combining its knowledge of mechanical watch design with technology from Silicon Valley. That combination could help the longevity of smartwatches moving forward, because there\u2019s no clear indication on what you will do with an outdated smartwatch in five years. \n\u201cThe Swiss watch industry is responsible for 65 percent of the world watch sales in terms of value, not in terms of quantity of course,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant CEO Peter Stas told me in an interview last year. \u201cIf you compare that with smartwatches, whether it\u2019s an Apple or Android, you look at the black screen for 95 percent of the time, or even 99 percent of the time. So that is actually completely contrary to what we have seen as the primary reason why people buy watches, which is the design.\u201d\nI spent time with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant\u2019s latest traditional piece, the Flyback Chronograph Manufacture, a truly stunning timepiece \u2014 the best I\u2019ve worn in some time. The Flyback Chronograph Manufacture I tested features a 42mm rose gold-plated casing with an in-house FC-760 movement that includes 32 jewels and tachymeter scale on the dial. There are numerous dial options, and the casing is also available in stainless steel.\n\u201cThat is actually completely contrary to what we have seen as the primary reason why people buy watches, which is the design.\u201d\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant has mastered restrained elegance with the Flyback Chronograph. From a design perspective, it can compete with massively successful watches like the IWC Portuguese Chronograph, which comes in at over double the price. It does have its fair share of ornamentations (including a wonderful crown clasp), but it isn\u2019t ostentatious. (If you prefer something even more understated, there is a dark gray model with a silver dial available as well.) At $4,295, the Flyback Chronograph is right on par with Tag Heuer\u2019s most expensive Connected smartwatch, but once again, the market for those two timepieces may not overlap.\nThen there is the watch market above $10,000. The Omega Speedmaster Grey Side of the Moon retails for $12,000 (although you can find it for around $7,000). The original Speedmaster was on the wrist of Buzz Aldrin during Apollo 11, becoming the first watch worn on the Moon. The \u201cmoonwatch\u201d collection \u2014 featuring the equally stunning Dark Side of the Moon \u2014 is a celebration of that event. \nThe Grey Side of the Moon is truly unique, with a 44mm casing cut from a solid block of ceramic, a sand-blasted platinum dial, an in-house Omega 9300 chronograph movement, and a bezel that glows in the dark. It is undoubtedly a statement piece \u2014 too big to wear on a daily basis, but perfect for a black tie event.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the pricing is in the materials, and the painstaking details that watchmakers like Omega add into their watches. And at these prices, there isn\u2019t any competition from smartwatch makers (anymore), and likely little to no overlap in consumers.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think there are many people who are buying $50,000 mechanical chronographs who are going to buy an Apple Watch instead, or people who would otherwise wear an Apple Watch, but then are like \u2018Oh no I like this [expensive mechanical watch], I\u2019m going to wear this instead,\u2019\u201d Stephen Pulvirent, managing editor at the watch publication Hodinkee told me. \u201cI think they\u2019re kind of competing on different planes.\u201d\nThe watch industry isn\u2019t like the technology industry \u2014 there is no \u201cbest\u201d here \u2014 it\u2019s all about preference. Choice is king when it comes to mechanical watches. Rolex has more color, metal, and band options for its Cosmograph Daytona watch than there are options for the Apple Watch. Some may prefer Hublot, while others think of the brand\u2019s timepieces as far too gaudy. Others will choose a steel band over leather every time.\nThe watch industry isn\u2019t like the technology industry \u2014 there is no \u201cbest\u201d here\nThese three watches are all mechanical and have leather bands, but each will serve totally different functions to different people, or could even be owned by the same person. To match that capability with a smartwatch is exceedingly difficult. Smartwatches are supposed to be an extension of yourself, but much like smartphones, switching them out when they don\u2019t match your outfit isn\u2019t a great user experience.\nWithout a doubt, smartwatches have shifted the luxury watch market in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s taught watchmakers not to get comfortable with their success, and it\u2019s also forced watch companies to engage with technology in ways that they may never have done without a push. \u201cI think, if you had asked them three or four years ago, most of them would have said \u2018Absolutely not. We\u2019ll never do that. That\u2019s not who we are and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u2019\u201d Pulvirent said about watch companies getting into the smartwatch game. \nSmartwatches may not kill off the traditional watch market, but it has created an ancillary market that can and will affect tides within a sphere that has only been disturbed a handful of times in the last century. The Swiss watch market didn\u2019t withstand the invasion of innovation by tech companies; it delayed it. But with the next watch-buying generation growing up always connected, and not desiring to be away from the internet like older generations, the time will come when tech companies with fix the issues with smartwatches, and they will once again be a threat to the traditional watch industry. Luckily for them, that time isn\u2019t right now.\nPhotography by Micah Singleton  / The Verge\n"}
