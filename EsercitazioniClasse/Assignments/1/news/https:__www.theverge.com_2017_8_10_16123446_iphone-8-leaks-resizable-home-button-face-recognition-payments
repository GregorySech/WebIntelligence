{"title": "The new iPhone could have a resizable home button and face recognition for payments", "content": " \nThere\u2019s been a host of leaks about the upcoming iPhone recently, most of which have been sourced from accidentally-released HomePod firmware, which also runs iOS. In the latest discoveries, developers have uncovered what looks like a resizable home button for the new handset, as well as support for Apple Pay authentication using facial recognition.\nIn a series of tweets, developer Guilherme Rambo found references to \u2018Pearl ID\u2019 (Apple\u2019s codename for its facial recognition system) that suggest it will be able to store multiple faces and will be accessible by third party apps. The firmware also includes the phrase \u2018multi biometric,\u2019 which suggests the phone might support two-step biometric authentication for extra security. That would mean combining, say, facial recognition and fingerprint ID. Additionally, the firmware code suggests that both the front and rear camera of the phone will be used for facial recognition.\n\n\nAbout Pearl ID:1 - The software definitely supports it for payments2 - 3rd party apps can use it3 - You can add multiple faces pic.twitter.com/aUotHwD64f\u2014 Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) August 9, 2017\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s more news on the virtual home button too, with developer Steve Troughton-Smith digging up code that indicates it will be resizable, and part of a \u201cperiphery area\u201d that can be expanded or minimized, with the home button hidden as needed.\n\n\nWe know some facts re iPhone 8 home button area:\u2022 it resizes\u2022 indicator can be hidden\u2022 no API to change color\u2022 tab bars extend under it\u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) August 10, 2017\n\n\n\nThe upcoming iPhone could also capture 240 fps video at 1080p, Rambo found. That\u2019s a step up in quality from the current iPhone 7, which shoots 240 fps, but only at 720p. HDR capture is also referenced in the firmware as \u201cModernHDR,\u201d but it\u2019s not clear what exactly that means. Designer Olivier Charavel created a mock up of what the useable screen space would be like using measurements found in the firmware, with the screen showing a taller-than-usual aspect ratio and a notch for the front-facing camera.\n\n\nProps to @charavel for a quick mockup taking these numbers into account. This is what I expect usable screen space to look like on iPhone 8 pic.twitter.com/wyCmfHtusO\u2014 Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) August 10, 2017\n\n\n\nPrevious leaks have shown we can expect features like an all-screen front, silent notifications while you\u2019re looking at your phone, and wireless charging.\n"}
