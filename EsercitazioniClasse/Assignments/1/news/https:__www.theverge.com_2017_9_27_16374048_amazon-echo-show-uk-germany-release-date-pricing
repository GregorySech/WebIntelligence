{"title": "Amazon\u2019s Echo Show is coming to the UK and Germany", "content": " \nAmazon is launching its Echo Show device in the UK and Germany soon. The online retail giant is opening up preorders for the Echo Show today, priced at \u00a3199.99 in the UK and \u20ac219.99 in Germany. Originally launched in the US, the Echo Show has all the same features as a regular Echo but with a 7-inch display attached.\nThe touchscreen display is designed to allow Alexa to show much more content to you, like tutorial videos or recipes. While the Echo Show launched with YouTube support, Google blocked access to YouTube on Amazon\u2019s device earlier this week. Amazon didn\u2019t address that major drawback today at its event in Seattle, but features like Amazon Music with lyrics and video calling will still be available. You\u2019ll also get fullscreen cards for answers to queries, including things like sports results and weather information.\nAmazon is expanding its calling and messaging features to the UK and Germany just in time for the Echo Show. Amazon hasn\u2019t set a firm release date on the Echo Show for the UK or Germany, but the company is taking preorders today and promising to deliver devices later this year.\n"}
