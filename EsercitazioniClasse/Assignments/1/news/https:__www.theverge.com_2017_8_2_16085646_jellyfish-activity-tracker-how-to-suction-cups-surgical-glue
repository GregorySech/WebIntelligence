{"title": "How do you make a jellyfish wear an activity tracker?", "content": " \nSpying on a jellyfish isn\u2019t an easy task. Jellyfish are hard to see, fragile, and, worst of all, they\u2019re gooey. Those traits make it tough to stick a tracking tag on them. But thanks to glue, suction cups, and cable ties, scientists are finally able to watch what jellies are up to beneath the waves. \nJellyfish are an important food source for hundreds of fish and endangered sea turtles. But they can also be a nuisance when their populations balloon and the stinging creatures wash up on beaches. The problem is, scientists know very little about these mysterious blobs of goo, like where they like to live, what they do, and what makes their populations burst into these destructive blooms. \nThe best way to watch an underwater creature without having to hold your breath is to stick some kind of tracking tag on it, which can be tricky to do. These tags act like souped-up Fitbits that track an animal\u2019s route, record its activity, and monitor water conditions around it. On a shark, a tag can wrap snuggly around a fin. And on a seal, it can sit sturdily on its head. But how do you tag a jellyfish? \nIt turns out, there\u2019s more to a jellyfish\u2019s body than just, \u201cjelly and mucus,\u201d says Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute scientist Kakani Katija in a blog post published yesterday. \u201cIt actually has some heft and structure.\u201d\n\nThat means it\u2019s possible to stick a tag to the top of a jellyfish\u2019s bell with surgical glue. These can last for up to a month. For shorter deployments, a suction cup can do the trick for a couple hours, according to the definitive guide to jellyfish tagging published last year by scientists from Stanford and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. \nFor long-limbed species like the barrel jellyfish, it\u2019s actually possible to wrap a tag around the stalk between the jellyfish\u2019s bell and its arms like a bracelet. Depending on the species, these tags can last hours to days. The main advantage with this method is that the jellyfish can stay safely in the water during the tagging process. (If the jellyfish is dangerous to humans, it\u2019s a bad idea to actually touch the jellyfish while doing this, the paper advises.)\nScientists have managed to successfully tag nine of the 200 species of jellyfish in the world so far, but there\u2019s a lot more to learn. One of the barriers can be actually finding the jellyfish to tag, Wyatt Patry, an aquarist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said in a blog post. When jellyfish swim too deep for the would-be taggers to reach them, his team uses the \u201cjelly donut\u201d technique, Patry said. They drive a boat in a circle, or donut, around the cluster of jellyfish to generate a current that pushes the jellies to the surface. \nIt sounds like a lot of work. But don\u2019t worry \u2014 for the rest of us amateur jelly fans without the scientific know-how or boat-driving skills, there\u2019s always the Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Jelly Cam, just a click away. \n\n"}
