{"title": "CBS has renewed Star Trek: Discovery for a second season", "content": " \nThe USS Discovery will continue to explore the galaxy. CBS announced this morning that it has renewed the latest iteration of the Star Trek franchise for a second season.\nCBS noted that the show has been successful at bringing in new subscribers to its streaming service All Access, and has earned acclaim from fans and critics. Following the season\u2019s premiere, CBS announced that sign-ups for the service had reached their highest level to date. CBS did not announce an episode count for season 2, nor when it would begin airing.\nStar Trek: Discovery is set roughly a decade before the events of The Original Series. The show follows Michael Burnham, a disgraced Starfleet officer who serves aboard the USS Discovery following the outbreak of war between the Federation and Klingon Empire. Presently, CBS has aired six of the first season\u2019s 15 episodes, and it has split the season into two \u201cchapters.\u201d The first nine episodes are set to premiere on a weekly basis through November, while the second half will premiere in January 2018.\nCBS also didn\u2019t indicate what direction the story will take for the second season. At New York Comic Con, the cast noted that the first season\u2019s story would be self-contained. Original showrunner Bryan Fuller envisioned Discovery as an anthology show, in which each season would be set in a different era of the franchise. That idea was apparently dropped when Fuller departed the series, but it remains to see whether it might be revived as Discovery continues.\n"}
