{"title": "Game of Thrones\u2019 first season 7 teaser trailer is here", "content": " \nThe first trailer for the seventh season of Game of Thrones is here, and it is mostly chairs and eyeballs. Accompanied by a slowed-down version of a very strange song called \u201cSit Down\u201d (because the trailer is about chairs), the 90-second clip shows Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Cersei Lannister all taking a seat in important chairs. Jon\u2019s chair appears to be in Winterfell, while Cersei\u2019s is the Iron Throne, and Dany\u2019s is the one waiting for her at Dragonstone when she hits Westeros this season. It looks like it\u2019s made of driftwood, which presumably relates to her new alliance with Yara Greyjoy.\nThe clip closes out with close-ups of everyone\u2019s eyeballs, Cersei exhaling a visible puff of air (it\u2019s winter now!), and then a close-up of a White Walker\u2019s eyeball. Cool! \nSeason 7 premieres July 16th on HBO. \n\n\n7.16.17#GoTS7 pic.twitter.com/0QyWbFBukt\u2014 HBO (@HBO) March 30, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
