{"content": " \nFresh off the news that it\u2019s opening its first permanent office in New York City, Lyft announced today that it has hired away a notable pricing expert from Uber to help it figure out how it can play a more proactive role in shaping the cities of the future. \nGarrett van Ryzin, a professor at Columbia Business School and Cornell Tech, will lead Lyft\u2019s new Marketplace Labs, where he\u2019ll oversee a team of applied scientists and technologists working on enhancing the current ride-sharing experience and better integrating Lyft with public transportation systems. He will report directly to Lyft\u2019s new VP of engineering, Luc Vincent, who has been tasked with leading the company\u2019s quest to develop its own self-driving car technology. \nIn an interview, van Ryzin said his goal is to \u201cmake the market more efficient \u2014 so all the things that have to do with matching and dispatching of drivers and pricing of the market and providing information to help balance the market.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, everything that makes Lyft Lyft: the speed at which a driver responds to your ride request, the length of time it takes to arrive at your location, and the fare you pay at the end of the trip. While at Uber, van Ryzin helped make the argument that surge pricing was a tool to increase rider efficiency rather than a back-handed way for Uber to make more money. He also saw the potential for the same model to change pricing strategies in other industries. Of course, most users just saw it as a necessary evil, even as they groused about having to pay more money during periods of peak demand. (Lyft has its own version of surge pricing that it calls Prime Time.)\nAnd while van Ryzin is working on improving marketplace efficiency, he\u2019ll also be pondering larger, more consequential issues for Lyft, such as its place in the city of tomorrow. This past summer, Lyft announced that it would begin hiring hundreds of engineers to develop its own autonomous technology. It also described its product of the future as an \u201copen platform,\u201d in which any of its partners in the self-driving space could plug into and begin offering trips. Van Ryzin said his job will be to optimize that process. \n\u201cHow do you develop a marketplace you can plug anything into,\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can plug human-driven ride-sharing vehicles into, you can plug in public transit links, you can plug in autonomous vehicles. Anything that would potentially get a person from A-to-B, you can synchronize and optimize with the same platform of marketplace technology.\u201d\nIf that sounds too Columbia Business School-ish for your tastes, van Ryzin boils it down like this: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about how all these modes of transportation integrate... how do you smash all that stuff together seamlessly.\u201d\n\u201chow do you smash all that stuff together seamlessly\u201d\nIn the future, someone could open up their Lyft app (if apps are still around) and see \u201ca menu of options\u201d for how they could get to where they need to go, van Ryzin said. \u201cBasically you wouldn\u2019t have to think about the combinations, we\u2019d do that for you,\u201d he added. \nIn addition to connecting riders and drivers, Lyft also thinks of itself as think tank for urban planning of the future. Co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green have written essays on the transition to autonomous vehicles and proposals for ending traffic congestion. Creating a new division of applied scientists to crack some of transportation\u2019s most intractable problems seems to be an extension of that. \nOf course, recent studies suggest that the impact of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft is not entirely benign. A new national report by the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies found that ride-hailing apps have only caused a slight decrease in vehicle ownership. Meanwhile, as people use these apps more, they are using public transportation less. Many trips that could be made by foot, bicycle, or via public transit are now made by ride-hailing services.\nFrom his perch at Lyft, van Ryzin says he plans to continue to study the physical impact of ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles on urban street life. \u201cThere\u2019s an entrenched set of interests around current modes of transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of cities are outgrowing that. And I expect Lyft to play a big part.\u201d\n", "title": "Lyft hires Uber\u2019s pricing expert to help figure out its impact on the city of the future"}
