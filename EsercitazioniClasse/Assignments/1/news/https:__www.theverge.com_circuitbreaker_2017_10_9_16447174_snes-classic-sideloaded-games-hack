{"title": "Nintendo\u2019s SNES Classic can run sideloaded games with this tool", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been little more than a week since the SNES Classic was released, but there\u2019s already a tool available for those who want to add more games to the console (just like the NES Classic before it). The hack comes from Russian user Cluster who has updated his hakchi2 tool, which can sideload extra games onto the NES Classic, so that it now supports the same thing on the SNES version.\nThere are release notes and a Reddit FAQ if you want to see how it all works or potentially do this with your own device. (Just remember the legality of emulator ROMs is dubious.) Cluster says the in-built emulator can support 75 percent of SNES games and there are workarounds for those that don\u2019t run. The SNES Classic is also capable of running sideloaded NES titles, too.\nIt\u2019s probably tempting to add more titles than the 21 loaded on the SNES Classic from the Super Nintendo\u2019s vast collection of games, given that the NES Classic had 30. Still, cracking your console more than likely undermines its warranty, and with the SNES Classic in high demand and limited stock, do you really want to risk it? \nNintendo did leave a cheeky message to those who do hack into the console, however:\n\n\nSNES Mini contains hidden message from Nintendo/NERD :) pic.twitter.com/ajqYL21zjh\u2014 Cluster (@Cluster_M) September 27, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
