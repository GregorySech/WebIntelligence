{"title": "Logitech will give all Harmony Link owners a free Hub after backlash", "content": " Logitech has been taking heat in recent days for announcing plans to permanently disable its Harmony Link device this coming March. But today the company is trying to make amends with affected customers by offering all owners of the 2011 product a free Harmony Hub. The Hub is basically the newer version of the Link that\u2019s been updated to control the smart home in addition to the many entertainment console gadgets that the Link supported. \u201cI made a mistake. It was an honest mistake,\u201d Rory Dooley, head of Logitech\u2019s Harmony division, told Wired. \u201cMea culpa. We\u2019re going to do right by our customers, and do the right thing.\u201d Logitech had previously offered a free Hub to Link owners who were still under warranty, and tried to assuage frustrations from everyone else with a 35 percent discount. Customers who already paid to upgrade at that reduced rate can now expect a full refund. And the company isn\u2019t going to be strict about who\u2019s eligible for the free Hub; as long as you\u2019ve got a Link in your posession, you\u2019ll be good. \u201cIf you send back in the Harmony Link, and say \u2018Look I bought this at some point,\u2019 we\u2019ll replace it even if you haven\u2019t connected it to our database,\u201d Dooley said. Logitech\u2019s decision, even after all these years after the Link\u2019s release, renewed an underlining concern that comes with cloud-dependent gadgets; you only own them until a company decides to stop supporting them and they abruptly stop working \u2014 even if the hardware is still totally functional. \u201cThe thought process was driven by the fact that we have something better, we\u2019re making it better all the time, it supports home control, voice assistants, and it does all the things that Harmony Link already did,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have anything to offer, then we would have done the work to keep the product working.\u201dBoth of these products allow smartphones and tablets to act as a universal remote and control your living room instead of using a separate remote. The Hub adds some new tricks such as Amazon Alexa voice support. To close out this whole thing, Logitech is also addressing a weird censorship issue that blocked \u201cclass action lawsuit\u201d \u2014 something angry customers brought up in response to the Link\u2019s end \u2014 from appearing in its forums. The company apparently chalked that up to the list of blocked words that stem from its community terms of service. "}
