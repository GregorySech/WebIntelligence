{"title": "Google\u2019s blob emoji are great and no one will convince me otherwise", "content": " \nA ton of things happened at Google I/O, but somehow the biggest news from last week was never even mentioned onstage: the latest version of Android will kill the blob-style emoji and replace them with circular ones that are more consistent with those from iOS, Twitter, Facebook, Samsung, and more.\nMany people, including some of us here at The Verge, said this was long overdue. But I say nay! To me, this is A Very Bad Move.\nAs I briefly said in last week\u2019s episode of The Vergecast, I adore the blob emoji because they\u2019re cute, unique, and show a lot of personality and expressiveness. While we can argue about the cons of Android fragmentation, one of the many reasons I like Android is because you actually have so many options to show individuality with the phone you use. I remember when I was in high school during the pre-iPhone years, there were tons of different cellphones to choose \u2014 from the ubiquitous Motorola Razr to the music-centric Sony Ericsson Walkman to the QWERTY keyboard Sidekick. Like our clothing choices and brand loyalties, our smartphone makes a statement about who we are.\nI\u2019m one with the blob, the blob is me\nAnd though it\u2019s true that a lack of standard emoji across the web means messages can get lost in visual translation, for me, that\u2019s not how I necessarily see or use emoji. When I type in an emoji during a conversation, it\u2019s not because I want the receiver to \u201csee\u201d how I\u2019m feeling \u2014 it\u2019s because that\u2019s how I see myself in the context of that message.\nTake the sweat drop face emoji for example. This is one I use often (don\u2019t ask) to emote nervousness, but now the Android O version looks legitimately ill, and much sadder than its iOS counterpart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojipedia\n\n\nThe kissing face is another I use often. I love the blob version of this emoji because even the little arch from Android 4.4 reminds me of myself \u2014 a short, petite person who has to literally arch and tilt my head up to give my significant other a kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojipedia\n\n\nSame with the weary face emoji and the way it literally droops down and shows tiredness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojipedia\n\n\nBeyond that, aesthetically, the flat colors on the emoji look great. I don\u2019t need emoji to look realistic or multi-dimensional. (In fact, I think most of the new ones look super dated and generic.) I just want them to be pleasing and cute to the eye, which Android O\u2019s versions are not. Look at what they did to the poor bunny emoji!\n\n\n@eli_schiff IT GETS WORSE pic.twitter.com/2Rj6MPZl9r\u2014 Ezhik (@SilverEzhik) May 20, 2017\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the ears!?!? It looks like a bear got thrown in a tub of bleach and is now pretending to be who it\u2019s not.\nIt is admittedly strange how attached we can get with what\u2019s really just a bunch of glyphs, but the fact that they virtually represent us is why the people who love them are so crushed to see them go. Why can\u2019t we continue to be a bunch of goofy, misfit-looking blobs? Wasn\u2019t it you, Google, who said to be together, not the same? \nYou\u2019re the company that, by some strange fate, brought us this emoji:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image contains sensitive or violent content\nTap to display\n\n\n\nOwn the weird.\nAll my blob lovers say it with me: I\u2019m one with the blob, the blob is me \u0f3c \u3064 \u25d5_\u25d5 \u0f3d\u3064.\n"}
