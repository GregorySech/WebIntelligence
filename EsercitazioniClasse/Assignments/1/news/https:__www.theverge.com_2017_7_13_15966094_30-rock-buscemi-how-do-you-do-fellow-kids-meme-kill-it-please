{"title": "\u2018How do you do, fellow kids\u2019 has become the \u2018how do you do, fellow kids\u2019 of memes", "content": " \nHow did we get here? And by \u201chere,\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201cBarb from Stranger Things nominated for an Emmy\u201d or \u201canother bad haircut for me,\u201d because I know the answers to the questions in both of those cases. I mean to the point where the \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?\u201d meme has maintained an inexplicable popularity for so long as to achieve the rare double-meta (memes are already meta) status, a height from which it is capable of breaking my brain. \nThis meme, taken from a 30 Rock scene in which Steve Buscemi wears a T-shirt reading \u201cMusic Band\u201d and a backwards baseball cap, imagining that he is passing as a teenager, is most often used by people trying to make the self-deprecating joke that they are old and do not understand something current or hip. (Or to accuse someone else of the same.) The meme, however, and the poster\u2019s knowledge of it, is supposed to subtly remind the viewer \u201cBut actually, I am hip enough to at least know of a meme to use in this situation.\u201d You don\u2019t really need me to explain it, as you\u2019ve seen it likely every day of the last five years, but just in case this ends up in a time capsule or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to debate with me at another time whether this image qualifies as a meme or is merely a reaction GIF, but the people who are still using it in this day and age definitely don\u2019t care.\n\n\nThey have used it so many times \u2014 and I am sorry to say that this \u201cthey\u201d includes basically all of my co-workers at The Verge \u2014 that its use has actually evolved to have the same effect as wearing a hoodie and carrying a skateboard into a high school. \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?\u201d this meme asks literally, and then asks again. It is about being uncool, and also using it is uncool. \nOnce this rather banal thought occurred to me (about three months ago), people only started using the meme more. Freud did not believe that women could experience paranoia, as they do not feel the same unceasing fear that men do of having their sexual organs cut off. And so, I know that I am not imagining this. \n\n\nme trying to get in on the @verge's cool video game clique pic.twitter.com/TYycJ7K2BU\u2014 Andrew J.

Know Your Meme explains the GIF\u2019s initial popularity as the by-product of online articles rounding up the best episodes and jokes of 30 Rock before it went off the air, and they are likely correct. The final season of the show premiered in October 2012. Sure, makes sense to me. But what about all those other peaks? They all happened long after the show stopped airing, and given the almost senseless flexibility of this image, it\u2019s very hard to imagine specific events that would prompt any individual spike. I can only guess at explanations for a few of these. \n\n  \nMay 2013\nMy best guess here is the publication of TIME magazine\u2019s notorious cover story \u201cMillennials: The Me Me Me Generation.\u201d The article starts out with an eager self-defense: \u201cI am about to do what old people have done throughout history: call those younger than me lazy, entitled, selfish and shallow. But I have studies! I have statistics! I have quotes from respected academics!\u201d This is a bad example of confident journalism, but a good example of the unconvincing \u201cI\u2019m self-aware\u201d message conveyed by posting one specific short moving image of Steve Buscemi. \nAugust 2015 \nThis is the birthdate of the subreddit r/fellowkids, which is a forum for mocking media and brands. Here are the rules for submissions: \u201cAds / media where 'the man' tries to appeal to young people using their vernacular in a lame, pandering way. The community has decided that self-aware ads / media are also welcome, but the non-aware kind is preferred.\u201d It appears this group has moved on from referencing their namesake \u2014 the GIF does not appear anywhere on the first several pages of results \u2014 which is nice and everyone else should do it, too. \nPlease note that the moderators specifically called out \u201cself-aware\u201d submissions as acceptable, presumably because true self-awareness is admirable no matter where it\u2019s found. Even in brands. Try it today!\nJuly 2016\nIn the final months of the 2016 election cycle, Hillary Clinton was regularly mocked for attempting to understand memes and pandering to younger voters. Hmm, not sure that was worth it. \n\nDecember 2016\nEach year, the month of December is capitalized by the media as an opportunity to recap the 11 months preceding it, and I suppose 2016 was a big year for people trying and failing to understand memes and youth culture in general. Memes hit the mainstream more powerfully than ever. Ordinary people with healthy, fulfilling lives were suddenly expected to understand 4chan, and the way misinformation moves through social networks like Facebook and Twitter. A reality TV personality became president of the United States and the whole world became what felt like a particularly heinous reality TV program. \nPeople were looking around a lot and saying \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d and having a hard time coming up with answers. So maybe it was just easier to go into the meme bank and pull out the simplest, most familiar icon of cluelessness and smash that \u201cpost\u201d button than it was to process even more information. This is my best and most sympathetic guess as to the enduring popularity of \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?\u201d \u2014 a popularity sustained for many, many years after it stopped being a funny or original joke. \nJune 2017\n\n\nhow do you do fellow kids is such a good meme i think it's in my top 5\u2014 Eilish Gilligan (@eilishgilligan) June 18, 2017\n\n\n\nAs I noted above, this is still happening. This is the reason for the post, and for my plea of \u201cplease stop.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be reminded of a joke that has its context five years ago in a TV show firmly grounded in Obama-era assumptions about what was funny and \u201chappening\u201d in the United States. \nTo further complicate my experience of the world, Know Your Meme\u2019s entry for \u201cHow Do You Do, Fellow Kids?\u201d lists the wrong episode of 30 Rock and the wrong story context for the meme. It comes from a February 2012 episode of the show in which Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) hopes to send private investigator Lenny Wozniak (Buscemi) undercover to find a man who mugged him. The error in the timeline published by what is inarguably the Paper of Record for memes might work as an overly complicated meta Easter egg \u2014 this meme about being out of touch is so powerful that it actually scrambles the brains of the most in-touch people on the face of the Earth. Wow!  \nAnd for good measure: Tina Fey\u2019s Liz Lemon spends most of this episode in a purposefully gross approximation of Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker makeup. The episode, called \u201cThe Tuxedo Begins,\u201d is a Dark Knight parody dreamed up nearly four years after that film\u2019s release. How? And why? I suppose, and assume, to give even more weight to this moment in which I feel confused and tired. \nAccording to my life experience, and to Google\u2019s data, \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?\u201d is more popular now than it was when the show it referenced was still a Thursday night staple for a national television audience that had so far seen only two Netflix original series and had never heard the phrase \u201cpeak TV.\u201d It is out of touch, out of date, and totally out of place in its current context. A meme of a meme, a monster that will kill me. \n\n\n"}
