{"title": "Peugeot\u2019s Instinct concept car is its vision of an autonomous near-future", "content": " \nOver the decades, Peugeot has earned a reputation for developing zany concept cars, like the Jetsons-like 1986 Proxima, the rocket-shaped Asphalt, or Moovie \u2014 an urban two-seater that looks more like a computer mouse than an actual car. The French manufacturer's new Instinct concept, unveiled at Mobile World Congress today, doesn't look as wildly futuristic as some of its previous creations \u2014 but according to Peugeot\u2019s design team, that\u2019s exactly the point. \n\"In the future, maybe you will have cars that can be only autonomous, and it will be forbidden to drive anymore,\u201d says Matthias Hossann, head of concept car and advanced design at Peugeot. \u201cBut this transition will be very long, and what we wanted to illustrate here is part of this transition, because this will take time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t create something that looks like a UFO.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a bridge, and it\u2019s something that we would like to push for the future,\u201d Hossann adds. \u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t create something that looks like a UFO.\u201d\nThe Instinct is certainly a nice looking car, and the design of its interior seems particularly clean and intuitive. But like many other connected car concepts, so much of its promise \u2014 the idea of cruising around in an autonomous, intelligent remote home that talks to all of your other devices \u2014 is predicated on a near-future that is still hard for most consumers to envision.   \nSpeaking to journalists at Peugeot\u2019s design complex outside Paris last week, Hossann said that unlike previous concept cars, the Instinct was designed from the inside-out. The idea is that drivers will be able to choose how much control they want to cede to the car \u2014 there are two self-driving modes and two active modes \u2014 and that the car, in turn, will be able to adjust its driving based on data collected from connected devices. (The car is designed to integrate with Samsung\u2019s Artik IoT platform.) If you just logged a hard workout on your smartwatch, for example, the Instinct could automatically shift into an \u201cautonomous soft\u201d mode to let you relax.\nThe plug-in hybrid\u2019s interior design is clean and austere, with a more pared-down version of the i-Cockpit that Peugeot first announced in 2010. The steering wheel and gas pedal are both retractable, and the center console consists of a large screen and an \u201ci-Device\u201d \u2014 a small, mouse-like handle that drivers can use to adjust interior controls or switch between driving modes. The floors are finished with a thin concrete layer, and its four seats are made of 3D mesh that is designed to adjust to the contours of a passenger\u2019s body.     \nThe Instinct\u2019s exterior is a combination of sharp angles and curves \u2014 the company says it was inspired by its \u201cgreat coachbuilding tradition\u201d \u2014 though it wouldn\u2019t look entirely out of place on roads today. (It\u2019s about the same size as Peugeot\u2019s 308 hatchback). The car\u2019s large, five-spoke wheels convey a powerful aura (it makes 300 horsepower), and there are colorful lighting flourishes under the grille and taillights. An air duct system has also been subtly integrated into the car\u2019s body for enhanced aerodynamics.   \n\u201cWhen you see a car with aerodynamic features, it looks like add-ons put on the car, so it\u2019s difficult to have something simple and really elegant,\u201d Hossann said.\nThe Instinct will make its official debut at the Geneva Motor Show next month, though Peugeot says that the technology underpinning the car likely won\u2019t enter production until 2025 at the earliest.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike more far-reaching concepts, the Instinct wouldn\u2019t seem out of place on roads today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four-seat car features several lighting flourishes under its grille and rear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeugeot says the interior was designed to provide passengers with the space they may demand in a more autonomous future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Instinct is about the same size as Peugeot\u2019s 308 hatchback.\nPhoto: Peugeot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear patterns are a recurring theme throughout the Instinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe car combines sharp angles with gentle curves in a surprisingly unified form. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taillights adopt the same linear pattern found throughout the car\u2019s interior and exterior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe car\u2019s Darth Vader-like headrests are made of flexible 3D mesh and leather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Instinct\u2019s mesh seats are designed to adapt to the contours of a passenger\u2019s body. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeugeot has pared down its i-Cockpit interface for the Instinct, though it retains its retractable steering wheel and gas pedal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA look from the back seat of the Peugeot Instinct. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrivers can adjust internal controls or switch driving modes using Peugeot\u2019s \u201ci-Device\u201d control.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe car\u2019s large, five-spoke wheels lend it an aura of power. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeugeot says its latest concept is designed for the near-future, as the industry enters a transition phase between active driving and full autonomy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeugeot\u2019s iconic lion logo lights up when the Instinct is in autonomous mode. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Peugeot 402 Andreau, which debuted in 1936, combined style and aerodynamics to create the \u201ctapered line\u201d that has since become a staple of its concept cars.\nPhoto: Peugeot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Peugeot Fractal concept, unveiled in 2015 as a car \u201cdesigned by sound,\u201d hinted at the experiential design that guided development of the Instinct.\nPhoto: Peugeot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Peugeot concepts, such as the Proxima (1986), aspired to a more space age future. \nPhoto: Peugeot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeugeot says the concept could enter production as soon as 2025. \n\n\nPhotography by Amar Toor / The Verge\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}
