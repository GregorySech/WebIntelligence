{"title": "Semi-automatic customer disservice", "content": " \n Dear Silicon Valley,\nI need your expertise. Can you find my refrigerator? \nMaybe it\u2019s you, Amazon, with your visionary fleet of robotic drones? Or perhaps Uber, will you begin to operate as a problem solver rather than a problem child? Or Apple, maybe you can build a find-my-fridge app. New York City \u2014 and maybe all cities \u2014 needs a smart delivery service to help save local businesses from themselves.\nThe refrigerator I ordered is somewhere in a delivery truck in the tri-state area. Don\u2019t ask me where because there\u2019s no way to track it. I spent an entire work day waiting in vain for my appliances, including a medium-grade 30-inch Whirlpool bottom-freezer fridge with accu-chill that never came. And when I called the third online customer service rep at PC Richard, the local seller that advertises \u201chonesty, integrity, and reliability\u201d to determine why I received no call, no text, no knock on the door between the hours from 7:45AM and 11:45AM (my original delivery window), I was told they had tried to reach me on my phone before running off with the refrigerator. \nMy refrigerator is running \u2014 this is not a crank call. \nI was assured that the PC Richard\u2019s delivery man would return in two hours to install my fridge. I left a series of additional contact numbers with the \u201conline\u201d customer representative, but was told that I would have no direct access to the delivery driver. Expecting the worst, I called the toll-free number again an hour later to confirm his whereabouts and was placed on a lengthy hold for 30 minutes, until I was finally told that PC Richard delivery was done with deliveries for the day. It was only 1:30PM.\nThe future will be lived in cities\nI have been told that the future will be lived in cities. But navigating logistics in the city where I live, New York City, can break you. Its imperfections remind me that we\u2019re still not living in the future. It begins at the gateway, the notoriously inefficient Laguardia Airport, the choked-up trail of cars at the Holland Tunnel, and the delayed subway trains. It continues to the long lines at Trader Joe\u2019s on a random Monday night. This place is like Level 3 autonomous driving in a blender: a giant ball of double-parked, semi-automatic customer disservice.\nIn the old days of mom and pop stores, I could have gone into the store and talked to Joe, the refrigerator salesman, whose nephew was probably also the delivery guy. Or if I had purchased from Amazon, like I do for more and more of my shopping these days, I\u2019d have a clear path of escalation and could have at least tracked my refrigerator\u2019s whereabouts. But here I found myself in the awkward middle ground, caught between an online service department and outsourced delivery service united only by their ability to disappoint me. I was a faceless voice on a phone with no clear course of escalation.\nCall, call, call, again, and hold, hold, hold\nWe are in a surreal moment of semi-automation. A local company can appear to be modern by selling goods on its website, but is unable to meet the baseline expectations of modern order fulfillment set by the internet giants. My only recourse was to call, call, call, again, and hold, hold, hold.\nI explained my frustration to the fourth online customer service soldier whose job is to field calls from indignant customers like me. \u201cHow about we knock that refrigerator price down?\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s going to make you happy is we deliver today, and that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\nIs this rant nothing more than a one-star review? No it\u2019s a real plea: help me find the proverbial refrigerator, along with a way for companies to better organize their automated procedures. I could have ordered my appliances from Amazon Prime, but I want local businesses to thrive. But to do so, they require modern logistical support. Otherwise New York City, like much of America, will just become another Walmart, USA.\nSincerely, \nTamara\n\n"}
