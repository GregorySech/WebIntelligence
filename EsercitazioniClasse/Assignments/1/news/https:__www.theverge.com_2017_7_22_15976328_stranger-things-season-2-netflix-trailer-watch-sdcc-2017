And from what we\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s plenty more \u201880s nostalgia. But the Upside-Down \u2014 and the monsters within it \u2014 is coming for Will Byers and everyone he loves.\nWe got our first glimpse of season 2 back in February during the Super Bowl. That brief teaser showed that the show was still mining the 1980s for nostalgic purposes, promising to turn the world upside-down, along with some bigger, stranger monsters.\nVincent Price\u2019s voice ratchets up the horror to eleven\nThis trailer makes particularly effective use of Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller, using Vincent Price\u2019s classic, funky voiceover to ratchet up the horror. And, of course, the show isn\u2019t done with Eleven yet, showing her pushing her way out of the upside-down back into our world.\nEarlier this month, Netflix announced that it was bumping the show\u2019s return up by a couple of days to October 27th, releasing a poster that revealed that there\u2019s still plenty of Stephen King references to look forward to.  \n"}
