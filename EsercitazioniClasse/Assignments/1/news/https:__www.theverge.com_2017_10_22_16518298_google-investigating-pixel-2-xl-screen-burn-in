{"title": "Google \u2018actively investigating\u2019 reports of Pixel 2 XL screen burn-in", "content": " \nOver the weekend, people with review units of the Pixel 2 XL began noticing a problem. No, not the already-known issues of muddy color and grainy textures when viewed in low-light, but one that\u2019s potentially more worrisome: screen burn-in. First reported on Twitter by Android Central\u2019s Alex Dobie, multiple people have noticed that when you look at the screen with a gray background, you can see faint outlines of the phone\u2019s navigation buttons on the bottom. \nYou can see it below, and I can confirm I\u2019m seeing something similar on my own review unit. \n\n\nThat's some pretty wild OLED burn-in on the Pixel 2 XL after maybe 7 days of full-time use pic.twitter.com/EPJTs6D0Kg\u2014 Alex Dobie (@alexdobie) October 22, 2017\n\n\n\nScreen burn-in isn\u2019t an uncommon issue, but it does seem especially worrisome that it\u2019s showing up within a week or so of these units coming into usage. It\u2019s also possible that what we\u2019re looking at here is image retention instead of actual screen burn-in. If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s not as permanent. Neither one is good, but \u201cghosting\u201d goes away where burn-in may not. Android Central has a good breakdown.\nWhatever it is, it\u2019s worrisome, so we reached out to Google for comment, and here\u2019s the response from a spokesperson in full, but obviously pay attention to the second part more than the rosy specs listed in the first half:\nThe Pixel 2 XL screen has been designed with an advanced POLED technology, including QHD+ resolution, wide color gamut, and high contrast ratio for natural and beautiful colors and renderings. We put all of our products through extensive quality testing before launch and in the manufacturing of every unit. We are actively investigating this report.\nIf it really is genuine screen burn-in (and early indications do, in fact, seem to point in that direction), it\u2019s a really big problem. Many screens, especially OLED screens, do begin to exhibit burn-in over time. But that time span is usually measured in multiple months or even years, not days or weeks. \nWe\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the issue in the coming days and will update our review of the Pixel 2 XL as is appropriate. Having a portion of your screen permanently marred takes what was a negative point against the phone and turns it into something much closer to a deal-breaker. \nUpdate: here\u2019s a big, giant shot of the issue on my review unit Pixel 2 XL. As you can see, it\u2019s faint \u2014 but it\u2019s also not the sort of thing that should even be possible a week or so in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel 2 XL screen burn-in\nDieter Bohn / The Verge\n\n\n"}
