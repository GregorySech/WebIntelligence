{"title": "Microsoft announces Age of Empires IV", "content": " \nIt\u2019s been a while, Age of Empires. \nMore than a decade after Age of Empires III was released, publisher Microsoft Studios has announced that Age of Empires IV is in development and coming to PC. There\u2019s no release window for the game; just  the launch trailer above, filled with concept art of historical battles. But even that will be enough to get fans of the series excited. \nThe first Age of Empires came out in 1997 as a real-time strategy game developed by the now-defunct Ensemble Studios. Players had to guide their troops through the Stone Age to the Classical period, with a follow up in 1999, Age of Empires II, taking the action to the Middle Ages. Age of Empires III was released in 2005, focusing on the colonial period, and adding a number of new game mechanics, and in 2011, the series tried its hand at free-to-play, with Age of Empires Online and its cartoony aesthetic. \nWe don\u2019t know where Age of Empires IV will fit into this history, but the choice of developer \u2014 Canada\u2019s Relic Entertainment \u2014 suggest a more traditional approach to the series. Relic has previously been responsible for a number of well-received strategy games, including Company of Heroes and Homeworld. \n\u201dWe can\u2019t wait to tap into our strengths as a studio to fuse historical context with deep strategic gameplay, and to bring this franchise back to the forefront of gaming and into the hands of its beloved community,\u201d said the developer in a blog post. \u201cWe look forward to sharing with you more details in the months to come. For now, just know we are beyond excited to be working on the next entry into the legendary franchise.\u201d \nUntil then, fans of the series also have Age of Empires: Definitive Edition to look forward to. This 4K remaster of the original Age of Empires will be released October 19th, and will be available exclusively on the Windows Store in Windows 10. It\u2019ll be nice to have the remaster for hardcore fans, but we can\u2019t wait to try something new in the AoE series. \n\n"}
