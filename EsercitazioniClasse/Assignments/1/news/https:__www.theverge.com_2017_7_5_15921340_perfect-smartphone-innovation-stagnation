{"title": "May we never find a perfect smartphone", "content": " \nThe iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary this past week has put me in a contemplative mood. I\u2019ve been thinking about smartphones in general, and about my perpetual quest to find the one that checks all of my boxes. And the thing I\u2019ve come to realize is that I don\u2019t actually want to ever find a perfect smartphone. So long as there\u2019s still something else irritatingly out of my reach, some other feature that my phone doesn\u2019t yet have, I\u2019ll know that smartphone makers are still innovating and pushing us forward. The perfect smartphone would be the sign of a stagnant industry.\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in starting every year with a refreshed anticipation for the novelties to come from the likes of Samsung, OnePlus, HTC, Huawei, and Apple. As much as we all love and rely on our smartphones, there\u2019s always something new coming down the pipe that draws our attention and our dollars. That innovation pipeline has slowed in recent years, as we can\u2019t enjoy such massive breakthroughs as high-resolution AMOLED displays every year, but it\u2019s still the case that every few months another layer of polish and improvement is added to the smartphone category. With such a moving target, it\u2019s obvious that an ideal phone that has everything one could want is a practical impossibility.\nThe Galaxy S8 from Samsung, for example, would have been the perfect phone at this time last year. It has exceptional design, top specs, a delightfully modern TouchWiz UI, and that envy-inducing Infinity Display. I rank its camera ahead of the iPhone 7\u2019s, and I\u2019d tell you that the S8 is the best phone you can buy right now \u2014 except the Google Pixel exists, and it has an even better camera.\nSo I use a Pixel myself. But the Pixel has a million little foibles that make it kind of crappy: the USB-C port at the bottom is sharp and digs into my fingers when I hold it, Bluetooth connections are easily cut off if I cover up the glass window on the back, and the headphone audio coming out of the Pixel is just terrible. it\u2019s also not waterproof and its battery doesn\u2019t last for a particularly long time.\nIn moments when I favor the best possible audio rather than photos from my phone, I lean toward LG\u2019s G6 with a quad DAC. That phone\u2019s musical advantage over any other is profound, and it\u2019s the sort of difference that you don\u2019t have to be an audiophile to hear and appreciate. The G6 also has a display that rivals Samsung\u2019s minimal bezels on the S8, though it falters when it comes to LG\u2019s interface atop Android and a few other downsides such as the aggressive over-sharpening of photos.\nThe HTC U11 could be considered a great candidate for the phone that balances all requirements, having a pretty great camera, a lightning-quick interface, and an especially gorgeous design in its Solar Red variant. But it doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack, and its display has the same old conventional bezels that Samsung and LG are quickly turning into a sign of having an outdated device. I\u2019m quite confident, in fact, that by this time next year the most obvious sign that your phone isn\u2019t from 2018 will be the size of its bezels.\nIf I insist on vanishingly small bezels, but I\u2019m not thrilled by either of the Korean companies\u2019 offerings, there\u2019s Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix or, more recently, Andy Rubin\u2019s Essential Phone. I love the idea of the person in charge of bringing Android to life creating his own phone and company, but Essential is more an indulgence than a real mass-market device. The phone is going to be distributed on a very limited basis, being a Sprint exclusive in the US, and it\u2019s made out of titanium and ceramic, materials which massively constrain the number of units that can be produced. It also lacks a headphone jack, and an early photo from it that was posted online and then quickly retracted didn\u2019t show much promise about its camera.\nWhat I love about smartphones \u2014 and I think this is a passion that most of us share but are unaware of \u2014 is that constant jumping around between devices and priorities. It\u2019s because we are never allowed to have everything in one single device that we treasure and appreciate it when any phone comes close. But the truth is that what we enjoy is the chase, and we wouldn\u2019t really know what to do if we ever achieved the goal of perfection. I enjoy following and writing about technology because of its constant progress, whether it\u2019s measured in millimeters shaven off a device\u2019s thickness, nanoseconds of improvements in touch responsiveness, or discrete new capabilities like wireless charging, contactless payments, and biometric authentication.\nThe perfect phone doesn\u2019t exist because smartphone innovation moves too fast. This was obvious and unremarkable a decade ago, but it\u2019s to every phone maker\u2019s credit that it continues to be the case today, deep into the smartphone age.\n"}
