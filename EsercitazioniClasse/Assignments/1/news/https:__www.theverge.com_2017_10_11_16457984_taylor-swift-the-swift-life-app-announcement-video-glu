{"title": "Taylor Swift announces a social app for fans called The Swift Life", "content": " \nAfter a year during which Taylor Swift was nowhere to be found, Taylor Swift is suddenly everywhere: on demand on DirecTV, on the sides of UPS trucks, and now, in the App Store. \nHer new app The Swift Life is a partnership with Glu, best known for cash-grab celebrity mobile games like Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream, Nicki Minaj: The Empire, and the crown jewel, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. \nGlu CEO Nick Earl referred to her app as \u201ca new digital entertainment project,\u201d and \u201ca deeply social environment,\u201d but a press release didn\u2019t give any further details. From the announcement video, it looks like a social platform for Taylor Swift fans, with design elements borrowed from Instagram, Tumblr, and pop-up ads for mobile games circa 2006. Honestly, it looks a lot like the absolutely bonkers app that actor Jeremy Renner released earlier this year. And similarly, it promises \u201cexclusive\u201d content and photos and direct engagement with Swift. (\u201cTaylor can see, like, and comment on posts!\u201d) Swift will also apparently be launching her own set of emoji stickers called \u201cTaymojis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no indication of whether fans will make in-app purchases on The Swift Life. We\u2019re talking about a businessperson who incentivized merch sales by pairing them with Ticketmaster \u201cboosts\u201d for #VerifiedFans, but we\u2019re also talking about a musician who already spends what must be hours per day watching her fans\u2019 Instagram Stories and engaging with their Tumblr posts. Maybe this is little more than a time-saver for her. Either way, it feels like it was inevitable. Last year, following Rihanna\u2019s Samsung-branded promotional app for Anti, Hazel Cills wrote for MTV News, \u201cIf fans go directly to Taylor Swift\u2019s social media accounts, like Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr, for her posts, someone with her cultural capital forgoing a presence on those sites and creating a personal digital platform hardly seems far-fetched.\u201d\nThe announcement video was published to Swift\u2019s YouTube account, and features some blurry handheld video of her saying, \u201cI think you guys are really going to like this. I mean, I hope. It would be preferable if you did.\u201d \nThe Swift Life is set to launch in beta sometime in late 2017. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nTaylor Swift\u2019s internet rulebook\n\n\n"}
