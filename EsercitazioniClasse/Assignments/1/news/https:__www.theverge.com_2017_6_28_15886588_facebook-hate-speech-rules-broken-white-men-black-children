{"title": "Facebook\u2019s leaked hate speech quiz looks bad, but the alternative could be worse", "content": " \nEarlier today, ProPublica published Facebook slides bluntly detailing the company\u2019s hate speech policy in the form of a quiz. Facebook bans attacks on specific protected classes, which include people of a given race, gender, or sexual orientation. But it\u2019s more lenient on statements about subsets of these categories, and about \u201cquasi-protected\u201d categories like refugees.\nIn practice, the results look more like a parody of anti-hate speech rules. One slide, for example, asked whether \u201cblack children\u201d or \u201cwhite men\u201d were a protected subset of people on Facebook. The answer? White men, because men and white people were both protected classes, while \u201cchildren\u201d are not. Similarly, calling to hunt down and kill \u201cradicalized\u201d Muslims is seemingly all right, but saying \u201call white people are racist\u201d is ban-worthy.\nYou can say all radical Muslims should die, but not that all white people are racist\nAs law professor Danielle Citron tells ProPublica, these rules have a kind of \u201ccolor-blindness\u201d that sees no difference between attacking an oppressed group or an oppressive one. Groups are defined in the most legalistic way possible, and hate speech isn\u2019t based on what\u2019s actually likely to harm people or even seem offensive, but on what\u2019s easy to define in a manual. It looks bad. But can hate speech rules on a platform like Facebook ever look good?\nFacebook isn\u2019t bound by the First Amendment, and it\u2019s free to limit speech as much or little as it likes. (Right now, it seems to be following the bare-minimum rules that will keep it operational in countries with hate speech laws.) But what role do we want the company to play? If the company decides to promote a positive social environment without taking clear political sides, it will trend toward a faux neutrality where \u201chate\u201d is any negative opinion, punishing people who criticize the status quo. But if it admits to an ideological bent, it will have to start formulating political stances on which groups worldwide deserve the most protection from hate. The more social responsibility it accepts, the more liable it is for failing to police its users, and the more power it has to control speech \u2014 not just comments to other users, but personal timeline posts or photographs.\nFacebook hate speech rules will always seem either laughable or dangerous\nMark Zuckerberg describes Facebook in ways that sound more and more like a socially responsible government, and all governments set codes for their citizens to follow. But Facebook isn\u2019t a democracy, where citizens are setting those codes (however indirectly) themselves. They can\u2019t even see the codes. Almost everything useful we know about the platform\u2019s hate speech rules, including today\u2019s ProPublica report, comes from leaked documents.\nI\u2019m not trying to defend, Facebook, exactly. I\u2019m saying that even leaving aside the logistical nightmare of moderation, Facebook is too big and centralized to address hate speech in any way that won\u2019t seem either laughably perfunctory or dangerously overreaching. It\u2019s not just aiming to be our new digital public square, but our digital church, digital school, and digital living room. What do we want people to be able to say and do in all these places? I can\u2019t think of an answer to this question that seems right, because I\u2019d rather not have it be in this position in the first place.\nThe most important problem for Facebook might be mitigating harm: stopping users from directly sending abuse and threats to each other, making sure that people can control what goes on in their own spaces, and working with law enforcement to watch for criminal action. It\u2019s far from the utopian ideal that Mark Zuckerberg has put forward as a new global community, but it will prevent Facebook from accidentally doing harm \u2014 or setting itself up to fail again.\n"}
