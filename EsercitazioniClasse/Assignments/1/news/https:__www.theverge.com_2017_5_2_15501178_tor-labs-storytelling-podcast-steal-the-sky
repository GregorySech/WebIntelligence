{"title": "Tor Books announces a new fiction imprint dedicated to experimental storytelling", "content": " \nYesterday, one of the largest publishers of science fiction and fantasy novels, Tor Books, announced that it is launching a new fiction imprint: Tor Labs. The new venture will focus on \u201cexperimental approaches to genre publishing, beginning with original dramatic podcasts.\u201d Its first podcast, Steal the Stars, will begin streaming this fall. \nThe imprint came out of a discussion between Tor editor Jennifer Gunnels and senior editor Marco Palmieri. Gunnels told The Verge that she used to work as a theater critic, and began talking to some of the people she knew in the theater world, eventually coming to the question, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool to do something to merge science fiction drama and publishing?\u201d \nPalmieri noted that while audiobooks have existed for decades \u2014 Macmillan, Tor\u2019s parent company even runs its own talk show-style podcasts \u2014 \u201cno US book publisher, as far as we knew, was doing audio dramas \u2014 plays written to be performed by voice actors.\u201d \nTor describes Steal the Stars as a \u201cnoir science fiction thriller\u201d about two government employees guarding a crashed UFO. The two fall in love and decide to steal the alien that they\u2019ve been tasked with watching, and then sell the secrets of its existence to the highest bidder. The story will be written by Mac Rogers, who created two podcasts for GE, The Message and LifeAfter. The story will air weekly beginning on August 2nd, and will run for 14 episodes. Tor will then compile the podcast into a full audiobook and a printed novelization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovelization cover.\nImage: Tor Labs\n\n\n\u201cWe decided to call our imprint Tor Labs because the entire undertaking made us feel like mad scientists,\u201d Palmieri explained. \u201cIt grew out of a willingness to look at the business of publishing speculative fiction in a different way.\u201d \nAs for what\u2019s coming after Steal the Stars, Gunnels and Palmieri aren\u2019t saying, but they have plans for the next big release. Palmieri notes that they aren\u2019t looking at replicating the same output as Tor.com, which publishes dozens of books each year. Putting together an audio drama is a \u201cmassive undertaking,\u201d he says, but notes that as they learn and develop the process, they\u2019ll be able to produce more stories, quickly. \nGunnels says that part of that undertaking comes down to how the two different styles of production come together. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging in that the scripts will go through multiple rounds of revision, some of which will come out of the production work with the voice actors.\u201d On top of that, the stories are put through the traditional manuscript process that Tor puts its regular books through.   \nAs a publisher, Tor has been experimenting with fiction for a couple of years now, launching ventures such as Tor.com as a separate imprint in 2015, which focuses on acquiring and publishing novellas and novelettes. Judging by the awards that its stories are racking up, it seems that the project is already paying off. Another experiment was John Scalzi\u2019s serialized novels The Human Division and The End of All Things, which were later collected into full-length print editions.\nThis new venture is interesting because it isn\u2019t focused on telling stories through the traditional means of physical, printed books, but as a testbed for figuring out how to tell stories as new technologies present themselves. \u201cIf the science fiction business teaches us anything,\u201d Gunnels says, \u201cit\u2019s that we can\u2019t fully imagine what new technologies will enable us to do until they\u2019re upon us. We want Tor Labs to be open to these changes in how people tell and experience stories.\u201d\nMost of all, they\u2019re excited for what\u2019s to come. \u201cAmerican audiences are rediscovering what the UK has known for decades,\u201d Palmieri says, \u201caudio dramas are fun.\u201d\n"}
