{"title": "American Vandal is the future of documentaries, not just dick jokes", "content": " \nThe dick joke-fueled mockumentary American Vandal is a refreshing take on true crime. It plays off the frenzy around real-life murder mystery series like Making a Murderer, Serial, and The Jinx, with a more lighthearted version of the genre. More importantly, it envisions the documentary process in more modern terms, creating a future where platforms like Snapchat or Instagram become tools of record for would-be detectives. \nTony Yacenda and Dan Perrault\u2019s spoof focuses on fictional high school students, as the team was heavily inspired by interviews with real-life teenagers. The Netflix series follows an ambitious filmmaker named Peter Maldonado (Tyler Alvarez), who\u2019s investigating an incident where 27 faculty cars were spray-painted with cartoon penises. A troublemaker named Dylan (Jimmy Tatro) is blamed for the vandalism and expelled, but Peter begins unravelling the school\u2019s case against him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the show\u2019s humor comes from the intensity its stars bring to examining the evidence, honing in on the vandal\u2019s artistic tastes, student vendettas, and gossip. The show uses a lot of faux found footage culled from students\u2019 Snapchats, Instagram feeds, and other social media presences. Yacenda says in order to create and understand how high schoolers use these platforms, they went straight to the source. \u201cThe common threads were that high school kids don't use Facebook much,\u201d he tells The Verge. \u201cCertainly not with their own friends. They use a lot of Snapchat. Instagram is the main one. But I guess you learn that kids have their public Instagram, and then they'll have a private Instagram for just their close friends, so they can post memes or whatever.\u201d\nIn the show, Snapchat videos and Instagram Boomerangs are used as alibis, evidence, or a way for junior documentarians to create timelines and track conversations. The team\u2019s hard-and-fast rule was that all these videos needed to be \u201cas authentic as possible,\u201d Yacenda says. \u201cWe always wanted to have logic of why a high-school kid would be shooting a video in the first place. Maybe it's somebody taking a selfie in the foreground, and something's happening in the background.\u201d\nPart of keeping this illusion up included keeping real platforms, rather than creating fake ones. \u201cI think that takes you totally out of the world, if we were creating our own social media apps for the sake of the show,\u201d Perrault says. That meant occasionally blurring out parts of an interface, or shooting some videos on an actual cellphone. This was especially true in the case of the show\u2019s big house party, a complicated event that tracks several of the show\u2019s key characters. \u201cWe wanted a ton of B-roll from the iPhone,\u201d Perrault says. \u201cAnd so we would clear the crew out of the room and basically play out the party as it naturally would go, and just give separate kids iPhones to get footage from that.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show\u2019s stars are believable due to how they use their phones to naturally document their lives, but credit needs to be given to Perrault and Yacenda\u2019s writing as well. Where many TV teens sound too scripted or too pop culture savvy, American Vandal presents a fresh take on kids, because they\u2019re just as awkward and honest as they are in reality. Perrault and Yacenda wanted to avoid creating caricatures. \u201c[TV shows] are trying to make a conversation funny, or they're trying to make it quick and punchy,\u201d Yacenda says. \u201cWhere, because ours is an investigation, we can really just let the kids talk like kids talk, which isn't the best dialogue for a typical TV show.\u201d\nThis also makes the characters more relatable, even to an older audience. \"Our lives are so digital, too,\u201d Yacenda says. \u201cYou could just project all of the insecurities and all of the desire for likes that we have. I think it's just magnified tenfold by the younger generation.\u201d \nAmerican Vandal\u2019s creators are already gearing up for a second season, but they declined to give more details. \u201cWe have an idea for a story that we really like that will be a new location and a new crime,\u201d Perrault says. \"There are plenty of new docs that have emerged since we began season 1, and then there's some classics that we can draw on.\u201d At the very least, the second season will probably put the dick jokes to rest. \n"}
