{"title": "OnePlus 5T will be announced on November 16th", "content": " \nOnePlus is just a week away from unveiling its next phone. The company announced today that it\u2019ll be holding a launch event for the OnePlus 5T \u2014 a rumored revamped, larger version of this year\u2019s OnePlus 5 \u2014 on Thursday, November 16th.\nWe\u2019re getting some launch details early, too. OnePlus says the 5T will go on sale in North American and Europe just a week later, on November 21st. It\u2019ll be widely available in India starting November 28th, and it\u2019ll come to China December 1st.\nTicket sales are just another part of building hype\nLaunch events are usually held for members of the media only, so that press can report on and get impressions of new devices. But OnePlus is doing something a little differently: it\u2019s holding the event in Brooklyn and will allow fans to come, so long as they buy a $40 ticket. The event will also be available to stream for free online.\nTicket sales are an unusual practice for a corporate launch event, but OnePlus says this isn\u2019t just another way to make money. The company says that all proceeds will go to charity, and that ticket holders will also receive \u201cswag worth up to $70.\u201d It hasn\u2019t said which charity it\u2019ll be donating to or what the giveaways will consist of.\nOnePlus is in large part built on branding and hype, so bringing customers into the fold for a phone launch event may be a savvy move. The company sells phones that are only somewhat modified from those that Oppo makes (they share a parent company), and it\u2019s largely distinguished itself through its marketing prowess. It\u2019s pretty clear that\u2019s happening again here. If anyone can tell me what the OnePlus 5T has to do with this robot, I\u2019m all ears:\n\nUpdate November 6th, 7:45PM ET: After publication, OnePlus reached out to say that it would be donating proceeds from ticket sales to charity and offering swag to buyers; that information hadn\u2019t been detailed at the time of the announcement, but a representative says it was \u201calways part of the plan.\u201d This article originally called the ticket sales an \u201can unusual way to make money off of fans\u201d by charging them to attend an advertising event.\n"}
