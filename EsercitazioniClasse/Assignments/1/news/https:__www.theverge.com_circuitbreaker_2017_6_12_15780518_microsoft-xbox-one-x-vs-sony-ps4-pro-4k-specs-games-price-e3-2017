{"title": "How the Xbox One X stacks up against the PlayStation 4 Pro", "content": " \nMicrosoft has finally taken the lid off the Xbox One X \u2014 formerly known as Project Scorpio \u2014 and the company isn't shy about calling its new game machine \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful console.\u201d \nThe One X is packing some serious firepower, with a custom eight-core AMD processor clocked at 2.3GHz, 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, and a 6-teraflop GPU with 40 compute units. Microsoft is proudly pointing out how the One X can support 4K HDR gameplay. (While Microsoft is tossing around the phrase \u201ctrue 4K\u201d a lot, apparently only some games will actually run in true native 4K, as opposed to checkerboard rendering.)\nSo how does Xbox One X compare to its biggest competitor: Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 Pro, which will be a year old by the time One X hits shelves?\n\n\n    Related\n  \nMicrosoft can\u2019t explain why its 4K is $100 better than Sony\u2019s\n\nWhen it comes to hard specifications, Microsoft has Sony soundly beaten here. The Xbox One X has a faster processor, a more powerful GPU, and more memory than even the PlayStation 4 Pro. Specifically, the Xbox One X has 6 teraflops (which, in very basic terms, is how many calculations it can perform per second), compared to 4.2 teraflops on the PlayStation 4 Pro. And the extra boost in RAM \u2014 12GB vs. 8GB \u2014 is also pretty significant, at least on paper. \nWhen it comes to hard specifications, Microsoft has Sony soundly beaten\nBut without some direct comparison of games on the two consoles, it\u2019s hard to say how much the extra speed and power will really translate to meaningful improvement in performance. At the end of the day, both consoles claim to be able to offer 4K HDR gaming. Based on that criterion, Sony has a $100 price advantage over the One X with the $399 Pro, which isn\u2019t exactly chump change. \nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth considering a final piece of the equation: games. Microsoft showed off variety of new Xbox One exclusives at E3 this year, including Crackdown 3, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, Forza Motorsport 7, and a passel of smaller indie titles. But compared to Sony\u2019s upcoming slate of God of War 4, The Last of Us II, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Death Stranding, Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, and Insomniac\u2019s Spider-Man game, there\u2019s still a long way to go before there\u2019s a compelling lineup of games that you\u2019ll need an Xbox to play.\nTo help you make your decision, here\u2019s how Microsoft and Sony\u2019s latest hardware fare when put head-to-head, along with the how powerful they are relative to the original hardware. (Just for fun, the Nintendo Switch is also thrown into the mix, and it\u2019s unsurprisingly almost comically underpowered in comparison.)\n\n\nXbox One X spec comparison\n\n\n\nCategories\nXbox One X\nXbox One S\nPlayStation 4 Pro\nPlayStation 4 Slim\nNintendo Switch\n\n\n\n\nCategories\nXbox One X\nXbox One S\nPlayStation 4 Pro\nPlayStation 4 Slim\nNintendo Switch\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n$499.00\n$249.00\n$399.00\n$249.99\n$299.99\n\n\nProcessor\nAMD Jaguar (2.3GHz, 8-core)\nAMD Jaguar (1.75GHz, 8-core)\nAMD Jaguar (2.1GHz, 8-core)\nAMD Jaguar (1.6GHz, 8-core)\nARM Cortex A57 (1.02GHz, quad-core)\n\n\nGPU\nIntegrated AMD (6 teraflops, 40CU)\nIntegrated AMD Radeon (1.4 teraflops, 12CU)\nIntegrated AMD Radeon Polaris (4.2 teraflops, 36CU)\nIntegrated AMD Radeon (1.84 teraflops, 18CU) \nNvidia Maxwell (0.5 teraflops, unofficially)\n\n\nMemory\n12GB GDDR5\n8GB DDR3\n8GB GDDR5, 1GB DDR3\n8GB GDDR5\n4GB LPDDR4\n\n\nStorage\n1TB\n500GB, 1TB, 2TB \n1TB\n500GB, 1TB\n32GB\n\n\nOptical drive\n4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\n4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\nBlu-ray\nBlu-ray\nN/A\n\n\n4K support\nYes\nYes (video only)\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\nHDR support\nHDR10\nHDR10\nHDR10\nHDR10\nNo\n\n\nPorts\nThree USB 3.0, HDMI (in), HDMI (out), IR, optical audio\nThree USB 3.0, HDMI (in), HDMI (out), IR, optical audio\nThree USB 3.1, one Aux, HDMI (out), optical audio\nTwo USB 3.1, one Aux, HDMI (out)\nUSB-C, microSD, 3.5mm headphone\n\n\nWeight\n8.4 pounds\n6.4 pounds\n7.2 pounds\n4.6 pounds\n0.88 pounds\n\n\nDimensions (in.)\n11.8 x 9.4 x 2.4\n11.6 x 9.1 x 2.5\n12.8 x 11.6 x 2.1\n11.3 x 10.4 x 1.54\n9.4 x 4 x 0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
