{"title": "What the EU antitrust ruling could mean for Google search", "content": " \nThe EU\u2019s antitrust watchdog this week fined Google \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) for manipulating search results to favor its own shopping services over those offered by competitors. The fine is the largest antitrust penalty issued by the European Commission (EC), which gave Google 90 days to give \u201cequal treatment\u201d to competing services in its search results. How the company does that could have far-reaching implications for its operations across Europe, experts say, though it may be years before the issue is fully resolved. \nThe EC investigation stems from a 2010 complaint filed by rival online shopping services, which claimed that Google\u2019s search engine unfairly promoted its shopping comparison product, Google Shopping, over their own. In a decision announced Tuesday, the EC said that Google indeed \u201cabused its market dominance\u201d in giving an \u201cillegal advantage\u201d to its own shopping service. \n\u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules,\u201d said Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\" \nThe ruling could \u201cpave the way for possible future cases.\u201d\nThe decision specifically addresses how Google treats shopping comparison services, but experts say it could set a precedent for how the company\u2019s search engine \u2014 the core of its business \u2014  operates as a whole. Peter Whelan, an associate law professor at Leeds University, says in an email that while the decision does not touch upon other Google search functions such as images or maps, the fact that Google was found to be in a dominant market position \u201cwill now pave the way for possible future cases\u2026 in other areas of its search services.\u201d Google is also facing antitrust probes in Brazil, and has been under investigation by antitrust regulators in South Korea. \nGoogle disputed the EC\u2019s decision in a blog post published Tuesday, arguing that Google Shopping \u2014 which displays images and links for various products at the top of search results \u2014 are more useful for consumers.  \n\u201cWhen you use Google to search for products, we try to give you what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d writes Kent Walker, Google\u2019s chief counsel. \u201cOur ability to do that well isn\u2019t favoring ourselves, or any particular site or seller \u2014 it\u2019s the result of hard work and constant innovation, based on user feedback.\u201d Walker also cited Amazon as a \u201cformidable competitor\u201d in the shopping space, countering accusations of monopolistic practices, and said that Google is considering filing an appeal. \n\u201cThe ball is firmly in Google\u2019s court.\u201d\nThe EC added that it\u2019s Google\u2019s \u201csole responsibility\u201d to ensure that its search practices comply with European regulation and that it must \u201cexplain how it intends to do so.\u201d If Google fails to change its practices within 90 days, Alphabet, its parent company, would face penalty payments of 5 percent of its daily global turnover. Whelan says that without specific guidance on how to ensure equal treatment for competing services, \u201cthe ball is firmly in Google\u2019s court.\u201d \n\u201cThere do not seem to be any easy or obvious solutions to remedy the Commission\u2019s concerns,\u201d Whelan said in an email. \u201cIt is possible that Google will have to offer a search engine with reduced features in Europe to comply with the decision.\u201d \nOne option would be for Google to adjust its search algorithm, or to prominently display links to competing services alongside its own. As Recode notes, however, such changes would likely lead to a decrease in advertising value. (Google Shopping began displaying paid links in 2012.) A more drastic move would be to pull its Shopping product from Europe altogether. As Search Engine Land points out, that\u2019s what the company did in 2014, when it shut down Google News in Spain following legislation that would have required it to pay media outlets. \nUS businesses and officials have previously accused European regulators of unfairly targeting American companies through various legal cases. In addition to two ongoing antitrust probes into Google\u2019s AdSense service and Android operating system, European officials have in recent years launched tax avoidance investigations into Apple, Amazon, and Starbucks. The US Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search practices in 2012, but the case was settled one year later.  \n\u201cThe EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate.\u201d\n\u201cThe EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate,\u201d Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said in a statement following the Google Shopping decision. \u201cThe EU\u2019s actions have created a cloud of uncertainty that will make large tech companies overly cautious about making changes to the user experience and service offerings that would benefit consumers.\u201d \nBut some of Google\u2019s US competitors have welcomed the EC\u2019s fine, describing it as a necessary measure to ensure a level playing field. \u201cI think it\u2019s a strong signal by the European Commission in response to Google stifling competition on the internet and diminishing consumer welfare,\u201d says Luther Lowe, vice president of public policy at Yelp, adding that it could be \u201cthe first domino\u201d in similar decisions from regulators around the world. Yelp is one of seven companies and trade groups that signed a letter this week in support of the EU\u2019s fine, and has been an outspoken critic of Google\u2019s practices.  \nIf Google appeals this week\u2019s decision, as many expect it to, it could be years before the matter is fully resolved. In the meantime, the ruling could provide the basis for civil lawsuits from competing services, creating more legal problems for Google. \n\u201cOn the basis of this decision, many people will bring cases and ask for damages,\u201d says Ioannis Lianos, chair of global competition law and public policy at University College London. \u201cSo it might be quite a lot of money and a lot of trouble for Google for a few years.\u201d\n\n"}
