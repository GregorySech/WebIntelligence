{"title": "Kevin Spacey replaced by Christopher Plummer in Ridley Scott's J Paul Getty thriller", "content": " \nThe fallout from sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey has continued, with the actor now being replaced by Christopher Plummer in Ridley Scott's All the Money in the World, reports Deadline. The film is still due to be released on December 22nd which means Scott will be working on an extremely tight schedule for reshoots. \nPlummer is replacing Spacey as billionaire J. Paul Getty in the thriller, which is about the abduction of Getty's 16-year-old grandson in 1973. Spacey worked around ten days on the film, shooting scenes that mostly feature just his character. The film also stars Mark Wahlberg as Getty's lawyer and Michelle Williams as Getty's daughter-in-law. Both are expected to have to reshoot material as well. The reshoot means Sony will also have to alter marketing content \u2014 a trailer was released in September that features Spacey prominently.\n\nScott told Sony only late Wednesday afternoon about the decision to replace Spacey, according to a source speaking to The Hollywood Reporter and other trade magazines. Plummer was Scott's first choice to play the role but Sony wanted someone with more star power reports THR.\nThe cast and crew of the film and Sony Pictures unanimously agreed to reshoot all of Spacey's scenes, Deadline says. Scott also asked for the film to be dropped from the prestigious closing night of the AFI festival. \nThis is the latest instance of studios and those in the industry distancing themselves from Spacey. Netflix fired the actor from its critically successful series House of Cards, while he was also dropped by both his publicist and talent agency CAA.\n\n\n\n\n"}
