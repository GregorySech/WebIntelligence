{"title": "You know The Defenders is a Marvel Netflix show because it has a hallway fight", "content": " \nWould The Defenders still be Netflix-branded Marvel show without a hallway fight? Fortunately, we won\u2019t have to answer this riddle. In the first full trailer, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Danny Rand finally united for their ultimate goal: punching dudes in a long, white walkway. \nThis impressive bit of choreography escalates from a moody march to a flurry of limbs and drywall. But each individual component is interesting on its own: the wide shot showing full bodies in fisticuffs, the dance of each character moving within the small space, Elektra sauntering in the background like the girl from The Ring. \nThere\u2019s a physical comedy to the clip as well, from Daredevil (decked out in Jessica\u2019s scarf) sucker punching a dude in the back while Danny Rand (a showoff who finally got some shoes) is bouncing off walls like a parkour wannabe. While we\u2019d never seen all four heroes assembled for combat, there\u2019s something undeniably familiar about the whole thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel and Netflix have been building up to this moment \u2014 the Defenders, together \u2014 since the first season of Daredevil. It was in this show that they also introduced one of the series\u2019 most lauded sequences: a five-minute, one-shot hallway fight scene. It\u2019s a cool sequence! Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, brawls his way on and offscreen through waves of bad guys. By the end, he\u2019s exhausted. Every punch takes him closer to the verge of collapse. \nSeason 2 of Daredevil brought another hallway fight to the table, with the addition of the Punisher. Fight coordinator Phil Silvera talked about the sequence to Entertainment Weekly: \u201cLast year, that hallway fight, [Daredevil] was tired, already beaten, broken, hurt, but he comes through to save this child,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, this is more \u2014 as the showrunners describe it \u2014 more of a descent into hell.\u201d Ok, fair enough. \nLuke Cage and Iron Fist adapted and continued this tradition in their own ways. Luke marches into a building with a car door shield, knocking out enemies left and right. Unlike Daredevil in this kind of scene, Luke doesn\u2019t seem worn out or stressed. He\u2019s in control, and the narrow space only helps magnify his power. By Iron Fist, however, the corridor fight was starting to lose its sparkle. The scene is full of cuts, and  the stakes seem low. Call it hallway fatigue, but the magic just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s a rough gig, being a superhero forced to fight in New York real estate. \n\n\n@kwameopam Every hallway is on a different floor in a different building.And every floor tells a different story.\u2014 Dan Slott (@DanSlott) May 3, 2017\n\n\n\nIn response to today\u2019s trailer, Marvel Comics writer Dan Slott told one of my colleagues on Twitter, \u201cevery floor tells a different story.\u201d Films like Oldboy (to which Daredevil would appear to owe a lot) or Snowpiercer have used this sort of cramped setting to amp up feelings of dread, claustrophobia, and hopelessness. Marvel adapted this idea to better define its characters: how they handle danger, and how they adapt to it. Luke is bulletproof, for example, and that car door is for show. It\u2019s a demonstration of his strength; that he can toss around a car door like it\u2019s no big deal. \nThe trick is to use these sequences sparingly. When fights in your series are starting to be recognized as a meta-goof, maybe it\u2019s time to mix it up a little. \n\n\nThe hall monitors unite. Just try to take their hallways. pic.twitter.com/wBb1Qgw0OP\u2014 Matt Patches (@misterpatches) May 3, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
