{"title": "Hasbro reportedly offered to buy Mattel", "content": " \nHasbro is one of the largest toy companies in the world (after Lego), and according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, it recently made an offer to take over its chief rival, Mattel. \nIf the deal were to go through, it would bring the two largest toy companies in the US and their vast catalog of brands together. The WSJ\u2019s sources say that the deal was made recently, didn\u2019t disclose terms, and that it might not go anywhere.\nBut, the deal could be an opportunity for Mattel, which has struggled financially in recent years. The company reported a decline in sales after Toys R\u2019 Us filed for bankruptcy in September. The bankruptcy also impacted Hasbro\u2019s sales, but the Rhode Island-based company has fared better this year, due in part to its toys based on Disney properties such as Star Wars, and Frozen. \n\n"}
