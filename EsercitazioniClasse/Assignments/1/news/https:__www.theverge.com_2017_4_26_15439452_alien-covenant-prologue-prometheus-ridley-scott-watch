{"title": "A new Alien: Covenant prologue connects the film to Prometheus", "content": " \n20th Century Fox has released a new clip from Alien: Covenant and it shows off how the film connects to the last entry in the franchise, Prometheus. While the movie\u2019s trailers have gone to great lengths to make viewers forget about Scott\u2019s disappointing side film, this clip shows that Prometheus will have a role to play in this year\u2019s film.\nThis is the second prologue that we\u2019ve seen for Alien: Covenant. In February, the studio released a clip that introduced us to the colonists bound for this film\u2019s planet, which happens to also be home to the android known as David, who we last saw as a disembodied head in the last film. It serves as a foreboding look at what we can expect from the next entry, including a callback to one of the franchise\u2019s most iconic moments. \nThis new clip is designed to bridge the gap between this film and Scott\u2019s underwhelming side entry for the franchise. Prometheus ended with the entire expedition to LV-223 getting killed off, save for David, and the expedition\u2019s archeologist, Elizabeth Shaw. They escaped the world by commandeering the Engineer\u2019s ship, and Shaw explains that she doesn\u2019t want to go home: she wants to look for the Engineer\u2019s homeworld.\nThat\u2019s pretty much what happens in this clip: we see Shaw reattach David\u2019s head to his body and their work to fix the ship and figure out the location of the Engineer\u2019s homeworld. David puts Elizabeth into stasis for the journey, and he is left with plenty of time to learn more about the advanced aliens, as well as the ship\u2019s deadly cargo. The clip closes with the two arriving at what\u2019s presumably the Engineer\u2019s homeworld, and David\u2019s poised to drop a whole lot of canisters on them. As we saw in Prometheus, this isn\u2019t going to go well. There\u2019s a lot of material crammed into just a couple of minutes, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is what the film would have been, had the reaction to Prometheus been a bit more positive. \nAlien: Covenant will hit theaters on May 19th.\n"}
