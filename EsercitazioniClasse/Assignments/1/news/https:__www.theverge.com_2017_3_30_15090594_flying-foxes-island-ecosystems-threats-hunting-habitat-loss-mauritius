{"title": "Flying foxes' adorable name won't save them from extinction threats", "content": " \nFlying foxes, increasingly at risk of extinction, face threats in the form of hunting, habitat loss, and mass culling. That\u2019s bad for island ecosystems \u2014 and, eventually, the people who live there, according to a new perspective published today in Science.\nUnfortunately for all of us, flying foxes are not actual foxes with wings. They are large bats with longish snouts and fox-like faces that mostly live on islands and archipelagoes from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean. The animals eat fruits, flowers, nectar, and roots \u2014 and they are key for pollinating plants and dispersing seeds. In fact, they can fly over long distances \u2014 over 37 miles in one night \u2014 bringing with them fruits (and seeds) and even pooping seeds as they fly. Plants aren\u2019t likely to survive if their seeds can\u2019t get far enough away from their mother plants, and so the flying foxes ensure their spread, says study co-author Vincent Florens, an associate professor at the University of Mauritius, in an email to The Verge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jacques de Sp\u00e9ville\n\n\nThere are 65 species of flying fox around the world, and about half of them are threatened with extinction. The bats are hunted in large numbers for their meat or as a sport, and the forests where they live are being cut down. Many fruit growers also believe the bats are bad, because the mammals eat their fruits; so several governments approve of mass flying fox killings. In 2015 and 2016, in the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the government killed over 40,000 flying foxes as part of a mass cull campaign, even though the local species, Pteropus niger, is considered vulnerable to extinction. \u201cThe cull was a response to the conflict with fruit growers,\u201d says study co-author Tigga Kingston, a biology professor at Texas Tech University.\nAlmost all of the threatened flying fox species live on islands. Islands are closed environments, so the bats have nowhere to escape if they\u2019re being hunted. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on an island, there\u2019s nowhere to hide,\u201d Kingston says. Tropical islands are also more vulnerable to cyclones and typhoons, which are dangerous for the bats. Sometimes, up to 95 percent of bat populations can be lost in a single storm, Kingston says.\nThe bats don\u2019t reproduce quickly, either. Female flying foxes become fertile when they\u2019re two or three years old, and they typically have only one baby each year. That makes it hard for populations to rebound when there are mass killings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jacques de Sp\u00e9ville\n\n\nSaving the flying foxes is challenging because the animals are treated differently in different countries. In the Nicobar Islands, for example, two flying fox species, P. melanotus and P. faunulus, are \u201cconsidered to be vermin\u201d and can be legally killed, the study says. In the Philippines, Palau, and Mauritius, there are laws protecting the bats, but they\u2019re not enforced, and hunters aren\u2019t prosecuted. Since 1989, all Pteropus species have been listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), limiting legal international trade in hunted bats. But in almost 30 years, the situation hasn\u2019t improved. \u201cConservation of the bats is actually worse than it was 30 years ago,\u201d Kingston says.\nThe local laws need to be enforced, habitats need be protected, and people need to be educated about the key ecological role the bats play, Kingston says. On islands like Mauritius, P. niger is literally the only important pollinator and seed disperser left, after two other flying fox species, some native birds, and other fruit-eating animals like dodos and giant tortoises were driven to extinction. Without these animals, plants won\u2019t be able to reproduce, including the crops locals grow for selling and eating. \n\u201cIf we carry on in the current situation then I think we\u2019re going to lose a lot more species,\u201d Kingston says. Not all hope is lost, but, Florens adds, \u201cit would require that human beings resolve to measure up to the so far rather pretentious definition of itself: our scientific name \u2018Homo sapiens sapiens\u2019 means \u2018wise wise man\u2019. There is nothing wise in so senselessly destroying the biodiversity on which we depend.\u201d  \n\n\n"}
