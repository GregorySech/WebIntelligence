{"title": "SpaceX successfully completes two Falcon 9 landings in one weekend", "content": " \nSpaceX has successfully launched and landed the second Falcon 9 rocket in roughly 48 hours \u2014 giving SpaceX two wins in its \u201cweekend doubleheader.\u201d The nearly back-to-back launches are a show of strength for the company that has said it intends to up the pace of its launches.\nThe rocket took off today from California\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base at 4:25PM ET, and delivered 10 satellites into orbit for the communications company Iridium. It\u2019s the company\u2019s ninth launch of 2017, and, six months in, are the most completed by SpaceX in a single year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rocket\u2019s 230-foot-tall first stage, which houses nine engines, then touched down on the drone ship called Just Read the Instructions floating in the Pacific Ocean. Musk warned earlier in the day that the landing might be tricky, and weather conditions were described as borderline.\n\n\nLaunch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium.

In fact, SpaceX hasn\u2019t lost a rocket during an attempted landing since early last summer. Today\u2019s leaves their landing streak still going strong with nine successes. \n\n  \n  Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it did) A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jun 25, 2017 at 2:41pm PDT\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal, because being able to consistently land the Falcon 9\u2019s first stages means SpaceX can reuse them. Refurbishing used rockets \u2014 which otherwise can cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to custom-build for each mission \u2014 is key to cutting launch costs. \nToday\u2019s Falcon 9 was a new one sporting larger, upgraded titanium hypersonic grid fins.  SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk tweeted that these are made out of a single piece of cast and cut titanium, and that they can withstand the heat of reentry without shielding. After the launch, Musk tweeted: \u201cNew titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.\u201d \n\n\nCloseup of the titanium grid fins.

That\u2019s more than a quarter of the way to the planned 75-satellite constellation intended to boost phone and data coverage worldwide, and enable better aircraft tracking. \nThe back-to-back launches are the closest together so far for SpaceX, which launched a refurbished Falcon 9 booster just over 48 hours ago on Friday at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. The reused rocket had previously delivered the first 10 Iridium satellites into orbit. On Friday, it sent Bulgaria\u2019s first communications satellite to space, and the rocket\u2019s first stage then landed on the \u201cOf Course I Still Love You\u201d drone ship in the Atlantic. It was the second ever successful landing of a reused rocket \u2014 but it was a little bumpy. Musk tweeted: \n\n\nRocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 23, 2017\n\n\n\nSpaceX hadn\u2019t planned for this weekend to be quite so busy. Friday\u2019s launch was originally scheduled for last weekend, but it was scrubbed so a problematic valve could be replaced in the cone that holds the satellite (called the fairing). But the increased pace doesn\u2019t seem to have harmed SpaceX\u2019s track record of successful landings \u2014 and this weekend\u2019s doubleheader is an early sign that SpaceX may be able to live up to its goal of more frequent launches. \nUpdate June 25th, 5:40PM ET:  Updated to include results of satellite deployment. \n"}
