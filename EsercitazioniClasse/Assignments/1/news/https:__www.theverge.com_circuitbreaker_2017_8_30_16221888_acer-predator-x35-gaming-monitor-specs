{"title": "Acer\u2019s 35-inch curved gaming monitor has a 200Hz refresh rate, G-Sync, and HDR", "content": " \nAcer is introducing a giant curved monitor today, with all the features you\u2019d expect from a new gaming display. The new Predator X35 features a curved 35-inch display, running at WQHD (3440 x 1440) resolution. Acer has managed to add both HDR and a high 200Hz refresh rate to the X35, which were both missing on the previous X34 model.\nAcer is also supporting Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync technology in the X35 to take advantage of that 200Hz refresh rate for gaming without tearing or artifacts. Acer is planning to make the X35 available in Q1 next year, but the company isn\u2019t providing exact pricing or release dates today. Acer\u2019s X34 still retails at $1,299 with a slightly smaller display and no HDR / high refresh rates, so it\u2019s safe to assume this X35 will be priced more than $1,000 once it\u2019s available early next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
