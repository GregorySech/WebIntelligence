The Verge has learned that Alan Cherry, who was part of the original leadership team that founded the ambitious electric car startup back in 2014, announced that he was \u201cstepping away\u201d from the company during an all-hands meeting at the company\u2019s headquarters today. A representative for Faraday Future has confirmed his departure. \n\u201cWe can confirm that he will be starting a new role at a non-automotive industry startup,\u201d the representative tells The Verge. \u201cAlan has been instrumental in building out Faraday Future\u2019s talent pool to more than 1,000 employees. We thank Alan for his incredible support for FF, and wish him best of luck in his next endeavor.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a tip for us?

His exit is just the latest in a growing line of executive departures from the company, which has struggled in the last year as LeEco, its biggest financial investor, ran into its own serious financial troubles. This past weekend, the company finally signed a lease on a new factory in California after plans to build its own in Nevada fell through. And that move was only possible because the company just received a $14 million \u201crescue loan\u201d from a new investment firm, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nJust two weeks ago, Cherry had accepted a \u201cnewly created role\u201d leading the company\u2019s employment training and development programs, according to an internal email from COO Stefan Krause that has been obtained by The Verge. It\u2019s unclear what prompted Cherry\u2019s departure, but sources tell The Verge that the move to a new role was viewed as a demotion. Crystal Peterson, the company\u2019s previous HR director, has assumed Cherry\u2019s role.\nUpdate August 8th, 7:25PM ET: Faraday Future has confirmed Cherry\u2019s departure. The post has been updated to reflect this.\n\n"}
