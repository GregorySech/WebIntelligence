{"content": " \nNext time you need an emergency order of LaCroix, you can just ask a Google Home to order a case from Target. Google announced today that Target will begin supporting its Google Express shopping service in the contiguous US. That also means Target will be supported through the Google Assistant\u2019s voice ordering feature, which is so far only live on the Google Home and Android TV but is coming \u201csoon\u201d to iOS and Android as well.\nTarget has only been available through Google Express in New York City and California before now, so today\u2019s announcement marks a major expansion and helps to fill out Google\u2019s service in a big way. It also follows behind Walmart, which is available nationwide through Google Express and added voice ordering support last month.\nHelping Google Home take on the Amazon Echo\nThe other thing that Target is doing, following Walmart\u2019s lead, is adding the ability to link an existing Target account to Google Express. That won\u2019t be available until next year, but when it is, customers will be able to more easily reorder products, because the service will know what exactly each person prefers to buy and in what quantities.\nGoogle Express may be far from Google\u2019s most successful service, but it\u2019s an obvious and necessary one to continue expanding, particularly as the company continues to go up against Amazon. One of the core functions of the Echo is its ability to easily order and reorder products, so for the Google Home to be an equal competitor, it needs to be able to offer that same ability. It\u2019s hard to beat Amazon\u2019s tight integration, but by shopping with well-known brick-and-mortar stores, Google may be able to win over people who haven\u2019t been wooed by Amazon Prime.\n", "title": "Google Home now lets you shop at Target with just your voice"}
