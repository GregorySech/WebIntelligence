The news comes from AndroidCentral, and as rumored, the new mid-range phone\u2019s standout feature is a giant, 4000 mAh battery that the company claims will get you through almost two full days of use on a single charge. With a low-resolution screen paired to that massive battery, that claim seems totally reasonable, although a final judgement will have to wait until the One X10 makes its way to users. \nThe battery life \u2014 if accurate \u2014 could be a differentiator \nAside from the battery, the rest of the phone is pretty much what you\u2019d expect from a mid-range Android phone in 2017: 5.5-inch 1080p screen, a MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. The cameras are  a 16-megapixel rear shooter and an 8-megapixel front facing camera with a wide angle lens for selfies. HTC has given the One X10 a few more premium features, though, including a a metal body and fingerprint sensor. It\u2019s not a particularly flashy phone when it comes to specs or design, but the battery life \u2014 if accurate \u2014 could be enough of a differentiator to make it stand out. \nThe One X10 has curiously only been announced on HTC\u2019s Russian site for 19,990 rubles (roughly $355), but there\u2019s been no word yet if the phone will see a wider release.\n"}
