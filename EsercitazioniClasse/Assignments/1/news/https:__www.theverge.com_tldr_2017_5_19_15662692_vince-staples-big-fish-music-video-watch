{"title": "One Video: Big Fish by Vince Staples", "content": " \nEvery week, a slew of new music videos hits the web. Watching them at your desk is not time theft because you deserve it; think of it as a nice reward for surviving another work week. But what if you don\u2019t have time to watch every video? Maybe you have a deadline, a hungry pet, or other grown-up concerns. In consideration of your schedule, Lizzie and Kaitlyn bring you a series called One Video. Each week we\u2019ll tell you \u201cone video\u201d you need to watch, why, and for how long.\nThis week\u2019s video: \u201cBig Fish\u201d by Vince Staples\nLizzie:  Most people would not remain calm if their nose-diving speedboat was being circled by a shark, and their lifejacket was floating towards the sunset. Vince Staples, in this video, and one would assume, in any similar situation, remains calm.\nThe song itself is a good late-night summer track, with bass so heavy it could leave a bruise. I think it would go over well at your next beach party. \nKaitlyn: Speaking of staying calm, and of beaches, I\u2019d like to add that Vince contributed a song to Baywatch (Music from the Motion Picture). So he loves beaches, beach dangers, and procedural solutions to beach dangers. I would guess. That song, called \u201cBagBak,\u201d features a really good lyric: \u201cBoy I\u2019m buoyant, we are / floating on them peons.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Vince Staples?\nLizzie: Vince Staples is a rapper from Long Beach, CA, so he\u2019s presumably familiar with the biology of marine life. \nKaitlyn: Actually, no, I\u2019m sorry Lizzie, he isn\u2019t very familiar with it. In this video, Vince Staples releases a goldfish into the ocean. Goldfish cannot live in salt water, even for the sake of imaginative imagery. We nearly disqualified Vince from One Video consideration because The Verge is a publication dedicated to facts and science, but in the end we reasoned that art can take some liberties once in a while.\nLizzie:  The goldfish gets pretty big by the end of the video, which you could attribute to salt bloat, but I have seen a big goldfish before. \nKaitlyn: Yes, it\u2019s a metaphor. Vince is in the phase of his career where he has to go from being a well-known, beloved person in his home state of California (a small pond) to a not-quite-as-well-known but critically acclaimed and pretty well-liked person in the broader United States (the ocean). He talks about death a lot, so the goldfish-in-salt metaphor is pretty good. \nWhat\u2019s special about \u201cBig Fish\u201d by Vince Staples: \nLizzie: \u201cBig Fish\u201d is special because it\u2019s relatable and could be a metaphor for absolutely anything. Are you a big fish in a small pond? A big fish in a big pond? Are you trying to keep your head above water while everything around you points to imminent danger? Are you a pescatarian? \nare you a pescatarian?\nKaitlyn: \u201cBig Fish\u201d is special because it\u2019s a good reminder that not all of your summer jams have to be peppy, it\u2019s okay to indulge in some humidity-induced gloom, and a good reminder that Vince Staples is releasing a new album soon called Big Fish Theory. It should also give you a little nudge to recall some of Vince\u2019s other music videos, which he famously comes up with the concepts for himself. For example, in a 10-minute short film for his 2016 EP Prima Donna, Vince raps as a bobblehead version of himself. \nPersonally, \u201cBig Fish\u201d is a good reminder of the time I went to a Vince Staples concert with my friend Lizzie, who writes one half of One Video every week. \nLizzie: Kaitlyn says there was a goldfish at that show. I don\u2019t know what she means. Maybe there was one. \nKaitlyn: There was, and it was integrated into the light show and graphics that accompanied the music. It was Vince\u2019s way of hinting that this day \u2014 the day of the \u201cBig Fish\u201d video \u2014 would come eventually. Lizzie couldn\u2019t see it because there were tall men in front of her, and she\u2019s quite small. \nHow long everyone should watch \u201cBig Fish\u201d by Vince Staples: \nLizzie:  I would stop watching just before the end when something unseemly may or may not happen to Vince. \nKaitlyn: As is often the case, I pick \u201cwatch it the whole time.\u201d If you watch all of \u201cBig Fish\u201d you might be lucky enough to discover that the YouTube algorithm has queued up a Pitchfork interview next. In it, Vince Staples says he believes Bill Nye the Science Guy is underrated: \u201cBill Nye is the reason all these kids know how to proportion their lean in their beverages.\u201d It turns out Vince is a science fan after all.\n\n"}
