{"title": "One Video: World of Wonders by Buddy", "content": " \nEvery week, a slew of new music videos hits the web. Watching them at your desk is not time theft because you deserve it; think of it as a nice reward for surviving another work week. But what if you don\u2019t have time to watch every video? Maybe you have a deadline, a hungry pet, or other grown-up concerns. In consideration of your schedule, Lizzie and Kaitlyn bring you a series called One Video. Each week we\u2019ll tell you \u201cone video\u201d you need to watch, why, and for how long.\nThis week\u2019s video: \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d by Buddy\nLizzie: This week\u2019s video was up against some real heavy-hitters, like Selena Gomez, Rihanna, and DJ Khaled\u2019s son. It won because it has way fewer views than those videos, and it\u2019s a classic summertime story: Buddy and Kaytranada spend the day in Los Angeles doing nothing in particular, picking up friends along the way.\nKaitlyn: \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d also won because of honest advertising. You didn\u2019t know, but that\u2019s how One Video is traditionally determined. \u201cGreen Light\u201d had a green light, \u201cBig Fish\u201d had a (big) fish, and so on. Some of the wonders in this music video: a T-shirt with a tulip on it, a garden with nice orange flowers I can\u2019t identify, a chameleon, a friend, a dance party on the sidewalk, two more friends, a Jeep ride at sunset, a new pair of white sneakers, a young man rapping to a young lady, \u201cI prayed for someone like you all my life\u201d and then comparing her to Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry, Naomi Campbell, Rihanna, and Wonder Woman. Um, it\u2019s so sweet? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is Buddy?\nLizzie: Buddy is a 23-year-old from Compton who, as a teenager, found a \u201cbuddy\u201d in Pharrell Williams. His first big hit was \u201cAwesome, Awesome,\u201d which was produced by The Neptunes. You\u2019ll have to forgive the title of that one, because he was only 18.\nKaitlyn: Buddy is also an old pal of some guys you might know: Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, and Wiz Khalifa? Ring any bells? In this video he\u2019s hanging out with another pal, Kaytranada, who produced his new EP Ocean & Montana. The EP is named after an intersection in Santa Monica, where the pals first met and started collaborating on tunes. \nAccording to Buddy\u2019s Wikipedia page, he belongs in two categories: \u201c1993 births\u201d and \u201cLiving people.\u201d Me, too! Both are true of me! This isn\u2019t how Wikipedia is organized, but I would also like to put Buddy in the category of \u201cgood pet owner.\u201d In this video, he feeds his chameleon some caterpillars and then tells his love interest some other things the chameleon is allowed to eat. Roaches, for example. \u201cKey lime pie is for the humans, though,\u201d he reminds her, and I agree. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s special about \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d by Buddy:\nLizzie: In a world of music videos with neon stage lighting, meme babies, and NBA player guest appearances, \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d stands out without trying very hard at all. It\u2019s simple; it\u2019s breezy; it\u2019s a barbecue day without the barbecue. Not only do Buddy and Kaytranada ride around in a Jeep with no roof, but they have a driver, and their driver is a cowboy. Is he a friend, too? If he is, he\u2019s the kind of friend who likes to stay in the car while all the other friends break for an impromptu dance sesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaitlyn: What\u2019s special about \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d is that it functions as a pleasant, non-aggressive reminder that you don\u2019t need to overthink it. Got an EP to make? Call your nice friend who\u2019s good at songs. Got a video to put out? I don\u2019t know, dance and film it. Got a lady you want to woo? Maybe just say a bunch of nice stuff to her and offer her some key lime pie. It\u2019s not rocket science. Why are we always treating everything like rocket science? Friends, relax! You don\u2019t need to mull everything over. \nHow long everyone should watch \u201cWorld of Wonders\u201d by Buddy:\nLizzie: I know Kaitlyn is gonna say \u201cthe whole thing\u201d so I\u2019ll just go with 2:19 to 2:28 (dancing), 2:45 to 3:14 (car ride at night), and 4:53 (final shot with the chameleon). \nKaitlyn: I\u2019m not going to overthink it, even if my friend Lizzie makes fun of me a little bit. The whole thing! Key lime pie for lunch!\n"}
