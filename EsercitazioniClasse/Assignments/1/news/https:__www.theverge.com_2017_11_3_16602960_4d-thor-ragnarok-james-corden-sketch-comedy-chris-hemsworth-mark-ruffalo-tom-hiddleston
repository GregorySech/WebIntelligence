{"title": "The \u20184D\u2019 version of Thor: Ragnarok might be better than the real thing", "content": " \nWhat is the future of film? A skit from The Late Late Show with James Corden imagines a bold new world in which moviegoers can watch Thor: Ragnarok as a cutting-edge form of cinema: \u201c4D,\u201d which Corden describes as \u201caction literally leaping off the screen. What that means in practice is a low-budget stage play, performed in the movie theater by actors in phenomenally cheap costumes and uncooperative wigs.\nThe twist? Those actors turn out to be the real-life Thor: Ragnarock cast of Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, Tessa Thompson, Mark Ruffalo, and Jeff Goldblum, reprising their movie roles for a live, surprised audience who thought they were actually seeing the new Marvel movie. \u201cWill they be mad that I\u2019m interrupting the film?\u201d Corden says. \u201cPossibly. You know, wherever there is change, people will call it disruption. So I guess, you know, what I\u2019m saying is, \u2018Who gives a [bleep]?\u2019\u201d\nThe 11-minute skit does include some light spoilers for the film, but it\u2019s worth it to watch Hiddleston lose his Inhumans-budget wig while Blanchett desperately phones her agent, looking for a way out of the production. \u201cI think those poor people just want to watch the movie,\u201d she says. The whole thing has a charming, middle school production feel, but the cast is game \u2014 at least, for this one performance.\nThor: Ragnarok is in theaters today, if you still want to see the real thing for some reason.\n\n\n"}
