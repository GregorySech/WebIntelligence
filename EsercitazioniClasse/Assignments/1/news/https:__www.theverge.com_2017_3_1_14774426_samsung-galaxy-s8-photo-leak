{"title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks in its full glory", "content": " \nEvan Blass, professional spoiler of well kept smartphone secrets, is back with another hit today, this time revealing the most-anticipated non-iPhone of 2017, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8. His new image reveals a handset that agrees wholeheartedly with Samsung\u2019s Mobile World Congress teaser of a device with utterly minimal front bezels. It also features Samsung\u2019s confirmed date for the launch, March 29th, and gives us a good look at what\u2019s presumably going to be the lock screen welcoming new users when the phone is released in April.\n\n\nI think this is what you've been waiting for. pic.twitter.com/FvYfsLOy0R\u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) March 1, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n    Related\n  \nSamsung Galaxy S8 review: ahead of the curve\n\n\n"}
