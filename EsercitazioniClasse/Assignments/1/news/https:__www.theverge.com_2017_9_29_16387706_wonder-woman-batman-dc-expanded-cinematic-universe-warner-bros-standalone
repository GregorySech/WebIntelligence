{"title": "DC is officially stepping away from its expanded cinematic universe", "content": " \nIt\u2019s no secret that DC\u2019s cinematic universe efforts have experienced some difficulties winning the hearts of both fans and critics. The exception has been the most recent entry in the franchise: the largely standalone Wonder Woman, released earlier this year. \nNow it seems that DC is learning from its past mistakes and successes. According to an extensive report by Abraham Riesman over at Vulture, Warner Bros. and DC will be deemphasizing the interconnected DC Extended Universe for future films, following a template set by Patty Jenkins\u2019 blockbuster hit. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been hinted at before, with reports of the standalone Joker prequel and director Matt Reeve\u2019s conflicting statements on whether The Batman would be part of the official connected universe of films, but now DC Entertainment has made the change official. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nFollowing Wonder Woman, not Marvel, is the key to DC\u2019s cinematic survival\n\nMoving forward, DC\u2019s superhero films will be divided up into what are ostensibly two separate categories. Some will be films that are technically still set in the same DCEU continuity as Batman v. Superman and Justice League, but instead of cramming everything into one strict ongoing narrative, the films will be allowed to breathe, focusing on individual characters and the specific vision of their respective directors. \nThe other half will be totally unrelated films, like the upcoming Martin Scorsese Joker origin story, that will be totally outside even that continuity. Those films, which will be released under a new, as-of-yet unnamed side label, sound like a bizarro-world opportunity for filmmakers to play with DC characters no matter how they\u2019re being portrayed in the other set of films. (For example, Jared Leto won\u2019t star as The Joker in the origin film, which is set to be directed by The Hangover\u2019s Todd Phillips.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe.\u201d - Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment\nAs DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson puts it, going forward \u201cthere\u2019s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe.\u201d Instead, Nelson says that audiences will \u201csee the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who\u2019s creating them,\u201d rather than the more intertwined storytelling we\u2019ve seen so far with Zack Snyder\u2019s films. \nIt\u2019s not the most clearly-articulated strategy, but moving away from the interconnected DCEU makes sense for the studio. It plays off the strengths of their biggest success, Wonder Woman, which largely ignored DC\u2019s universe and instead let director Patty Jenkins create a unique movie that was wholly devoted to its central character. It\u2019s the same thing that worked for DC in the past, too. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy, while wildly different from Wonder Woman on a thematic level, saw tremendous success with the same playbook: let Nolan play to his strengths and just tell a great Batman story. \nAs I argued in a piece earlier this year, it would also give DC a way to differentiate itself from Marvel, who\u2019s notably terrible at keeping filmmakers that don\u2019t fit into its narrow box of expectations. Look at Edgar Wright leaving Ant-Man, or Ava DuVernay passing on Black Panther for proof \u2014 or better yet, Patty Jenkins and Joss Whedon, both of whom are now in charge of DC\u2019s biggest sequels after disagreements with Marvel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at DC\u2019s newly announced strategy, the biggest question is actually why even bother with drawing a distinction between the two types of future films in the first place? If the goal is to largely ignore the interconnected universe, why keep the DCEU around at all? \nWhy keep the DCEU around at all? \nThe answer is probably two-fold. DC still has hundreds of millions of dollars sunk into the upcoming Justice League, in what is supposed to be its long-awaited answer to The Avengers. Joss Whedon is extensively reworking the film that Snyder originally started, but Warner Bros. is too far into this particular phase of the DCEU to turn back now. (It\u2019s worth noting, however, that a once-planned Justice League sequel is never mentioned by Nelson or DC Entertainment chief creative officer Geoff Johns in the Vulture piece.) \nThe other is that there is still some good in the DCEU, even if it\u2019s just in the form of actors like Gal Gadot, who has already become the canonical Wonder Woman in the eyes of fans everywhere. Keeping the DCEU around, even if in name only, lets DC continue to build off the work it\u2019s already done. And the studio appears to be planning to do just that: next year\u2019s Aquaman will feature Jason Momoa in the title role, building off his appearance in Justice League, even though the studio is considering Aquaman one of the first new movies that won\u2019t be part of an overarching storyline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, DC still has to make good films for this to work. Wonder Woman is certainly an amazing proof of concept, but it remains to be seen whether or not DC and Warner Bros. can continue to build off that success going forward. \nDC still has to make good films for this to work\nThere will certainly be plenty of opportunity for DC to correct its mistakes. Along with Aquaman and Justice League, Warner Bros. has announced a growing slate that includes Shazam, Wonder Woman 2, Cyborg, Green Lantern Corps, Suicide Squad 2, Justice League Dark, Flashpoint, The Batman, Batgirl, Gotham City Sirens... and that\u2019s just getting started. According to Nelson and Johns, DC Entertainment seems to have a strong sense about what has been going wrong with its movie universe. Now it is time for the studio to show it knows how to do things right.\n"}
