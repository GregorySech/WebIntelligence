{"title": "I Kill Giants preserves the emotion and mystery of the graphic novel it adapts", "content": " \nWelcome to Cheat Sheet, our brief breakdown-style reviews of festival films, VR previews, and other special event releases. This review comes from the Toronto International Film Festival.\nIn 2009, comics writer Joe Kelly and artist J.M. Ken Niimura produced one of the year\u2019s best graphic novels: I Kill Giants, the action-packed story of a defiant, troubled 5th grader obsessed with her private war against giants. Kelly plays it coy with his readers throughout the book: Barbara Thorson\u2019s classmates see her as weird and obnoxious, while school officials consider her imaginative and troubled at best, and dangerously disturbed at worst. No one considers the possibility that she\u2019s actually facing down giants \u2014 because giants don\u2019t exist.\nKelly also scripted the live-action film adaptation, which explains why it\u2019s so intelligent and careful about playing the same balancing act with the audience as the graphic novel. Viewers get to see what Barbara (played by Madison Wolfe) sees \u2014 the towering, slow-moving, dangerous forest giant that\u2019s haunting her seaside town, the bullying harbingers who taunt her when her traps don\u2019t work. But Kelly still leaves the question open of whether Barbara is the only sane person in town, or she\u2019s fighting her own delusions.\nEither way, she\u2019s clearly hurting the people who care about her and are trying to help her, including her sweet new friend Sophia (Sydney Wade), her tentative school counselor Mrs. Moll\u00e9 (Star Trek\u2019s Zoe Saldana), and her desperate, frayed older sister Karen (Imogen Poots). Even if Barbara is the only one who can see giants and knows how to fight them, her level of obsession with them has taken on a dangerous edge, leading her to act out in school and drive other people away. She acts like this is a natural side effect of her role as the town\u2019s protector, but she\u2019s clearly lonely, angry, and carrying around a weight that other people misinterpret. The film gradually unravels the nature of that weight, partly as a mystery, but more importantly, as a study of how concealing pain alone is harder and heavier than processing it with other people. \n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\nA little bit fantasy, a little bit horror, a little bit family drama. It\u2019s probably best described as a dark fairy tale, equally indebted to Guillermo del Toro and The NeverEnding Story. \nWhat\u2019s it about?\nA fair bit of I Kill Giants is just about process. It opens with Barbara studiously making and testing bait for the giants, laying out experiments, and observing the results. There\u2019s a personal human story going on between Barbara and the various figures in her life. (Virtually all of them female, including the people who support her and the bullies who haunt her; the speaking roles for male characters are fairly minimal.) But the film spends a fair bit of time with her alone, pursuing her quiet obsession \u2014 guarding her school with runes and handmade fetishes, leaving containers of rotting food around town as further bait, and other activities that look like mental illness from one angle, and a lonely, complicated vigil from another. If nothing else, it\u2019s impressive how, at such a young age, Barbara is so devoted to her self-appointed duties. She treats other people with fearless contempt because she sees herself as doing more important work, with bigger consequences, than whatever they\u2019re using to fill their empty lives. But in a way, she\u2019s earned that contempt. She works hard at planning for and dealing with giants. She\u2019s an adolescent girl with a full-time job.\nBut more than that, I Kill Giants is about loneliness and how hard it can be to face our fears, let alone to let other people in on those fears. Barbara takes on her solitary task with the ferocity of any hero saving the world because no one else seems to be doing it, but she also tries to let other people into her life. It\u2019s telling, and tragic, that she seems to be most balanced and confident when she\u2019s keeping everyone at arm\u2019s length. Only opening up seems to leave her vulnerable, frightened, and uncertain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIFF\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nGrief, denial, the outsized fantasies of childhood, and a couple of different kinds of personal courage. Also: bullies, and the way they heighten every negative emotion. Bullies suck.\nIs it good?\nThis is the feature-film directorial debut of Denmark\u2019s Anders Walter, already an Oscar-winner for his short film Helium. As a first-time film statement, I Kill Giants is particularly assured and remarkable. The CGI effects around the giants are clearly low-budget and a little shaky, but otherwise, the film looks marvelous. The cool tones of a grayish city and the deep woods around it contrast with the bright colors of Barbara\u2019s outfits, emphasizing her separation from the world. The visuals are sharp and striking, fitting for a real-world fairy tale. The graphic novel is visually dynamic and fantastical in a way that suggested it might only work in animation, but Walter gives it a real-world gravitas that falls somewhere between a del Toro film and M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s The Village. \nThe film\u2019s biggest flaw may be that the story becomes abrupt and artificially pat toward the end, particularly around the way Barbara\u2019s story and her personal issues resolve. The story strongly recalls 2016\u2019s A Monster Calls \u2014 Kelly\u2019s graphic novel hit shelves two years before Patrick Ness\u2019 novel A Monster Calls, but the movie adaptation of the latter beat I Kill Giants to the screen by a year, and the symbolism and even some of the monster visuals are undeniably so similar that I Kill Giants feels like it\u2019s operating in the other film\u2019s shadow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIFF\n\n\nBut I Kill Giants has its own distinct strengths, especially in Wolfe\u2019s fierce, nakedly hurting performance. As a girl who unashamedly runs around in mismatched layers and bunny ears (she tells Sophia they put her in touch with her spirit animal), she presents a potentially comical figure. But Wolfe gives her a sense of nuance and humanity. She is just a little silly, as children sometimes are when they take things extremely seriously. But her emotional armor is believable and compelling, and the constantly visible cracks in that armor make her story poignant. A scene where she awkwardly, painfully tries to relate to her sister Karen through puppets and cobbled-together action figures brings across just how much of a struggle Barbara finds in her efforts to relate to people. And yet that scene is funny, as well. There\u2019s a lot of emotion coming through in I Kill Giants. The way Wolfe performs it, and Walter frames and shoots it, makes Barbara\u2019s journey work both as metaphor and as a more literal experience in navigating the particular monsters of bereavement.\nWhat should it be rated?\nThere\u2019s some scary monster action and some painful themes that may go over kids\u2019 heads, but nothing graphic. It\u2019s a safe enough PG.\nHow can I actually watch it?\nI Kill Giants is looking for an American distributor, much like A Monster Calls before it.\n"}
