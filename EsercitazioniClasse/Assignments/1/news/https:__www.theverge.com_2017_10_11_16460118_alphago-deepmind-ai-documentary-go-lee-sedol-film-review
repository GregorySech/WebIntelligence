{"content": " What can we learn from losing? That\u2019s the question at the heart of the documentary AlphaGo, about an AI program designed to play the ancient Chinese board game Go. The film follows AlphaGo and its creators, the Google-owned firm DeepMind, as the program defeats first the European champion, Fan Hui, then the legendary player Lee Se-dol. Fan and Lee are forced to answer this question as they\u2019re overwhelmed by AlphaGo\u2019s uncanny play style. And as artificial intelligence imitates more of the qualities we consider uniquely human, their conundrum is an important preview for the rest of us, who may soon be asking ourselves the very same things: What will do when a computer takes our jobs? When we prefer its company to human company? When it makes art we love? How will it feel to be usurped? After Fan\u2019s first losses against AlphaGo at DeepMind\u2019s London headquarters, he goes for an hourlong walk to calm his nerves. He returns and loses again, laughing in exasperation and disbelief. He later joins DeepMind to help train the AI that beat him, and stays in the film as a primary narrator, offering the most open, guileless, and poetic perspective on what takes place. In the televised matches between AlphaGo and Lee in South Korea, he acts as a referee, but it becomes clear he isn\u2019t neutral: he\u2019s an AlphaGo convert.Lee starts out confident he\u2019ll win \u2014 but the tables are soon turnedWhen it\u2019s Lee\u2019s turn to face the music, he approaches the match with understandably fake humility. He\u2019s quiet and shy in interviews, but confident he\u2019ll win all five games. The film\u2019s experts agree: Go is much more complex than chess, with more possible board configurations than atoms in the observable universe. Computers cannot brute-force their way to victory by plotting out every conceivable move, so they\u2019ll have to show something akin to human ingenuity when they play. Nevertheless, Lee loses his first three matches in a row. AlphaGo\u2019s footage at this point is a slow-motion car crash of understanding, as Lee gradually realizes what he\u2019s up against. In the first match, he instinctively looks up at the man tasked with moving pieces for the computer \u2014 AlphaGo\u2019s lead programmer, Aja Huang \u2014 before remembering that this isn\u2019t his opponent. After his first loss, he rages on the board: going on the attack in uncharacteristic fashion, then retreating to contemplate a single move for 12 minutes. AlphaGo, meanwhile, weighs every decision equally, pausing for a minute and a half before making its response. There\u2019s torture in this regularity. AlphaGo\u2019s pauses are implacable, consistent: it doesn\u2019t respond to Lee\u2019s struggle; it plays the game as if he simply wasn\u2019t there.

If you don\u2019t remember how the matches went, I won\u2019t spoil the film for you, but suffice to say that humanity does land at least one blow on the machines, through Lee\u2019s so-called \u201cdivine move\u201d \u2014 Go terminology for a play that is both unexpected and entirely original. The film\u2019s third act drags a little. The behind-the-scenes footage of the DeepMind team gives insight into the emotions that go into such matches  they respect the game immensely, and are as stricken as Lee is at his losses , but not everyone will be satisfied with lots of shots of people looking at computer screens, and the narrative arc feels a little by-the-numbers. Similarly, while the music score is effective, it\u2019s oddly conspicuous. It prods and pokes viewers with unsubtle emotional cues, like a reality TV show would. \u201cNow, you should be nervous; now you should feel relieved.\u201d Lee\u2019s relationship with AlphaGo develops from frustration to collaborationThe film transcends this clumsiness, though, for two reasons. First, the emotions of everyone on-screen, from programmers to Go players, feel authentic and honest. No one cares about the cameras; they care about the game, for their own reasons. And second, the broader narrative affects us all. Artificial intelligence isn\u2019t going to go rogue and grab the nuclear codes any time soon, but the algorithms it helps produce are already having a massive impact on society. They\u2019re speeding up automation and threatening jobs; they\u2019re manipulating your news feed and shaping your online addictions. When Lee confronts the AI software, the experience is humbling, but it lets him improve his game. It grants him his \u201cdivine move\u201d  a very literal deus ex machina  and the film\u2019s final scene frames this as both heroic and a pattern which humanity should always try to replicate in our future encounters with AI. You fight and you don\u2019t give up. You learn something. But while this works in the context of Lee\u2019s battle with DeepMind\u2019s AI, it feels a little limited with regards to the wider challenges posed by artificial intelligence. We\u2019d all be lucky to have a confrontation with the machines as neat and well-defined as the one in AlphaGo. More likely, the forces of automation we\u2019ll face will be impersonal and incomprehensible. They\u2019ll come in the form of star ratings we can\u2019t object to, and algorithms we can\u2019t fully understand. Dealing with the problems of AI will take a perspective that looks beyond individual battles. AlphaGo is worth seeing because it raises these questions \u2014 but don\u2019t be surprised if it doesn\u2019t offer answers. It\u2019d take some sort of super-intelligent AI to work out what\u2019ll happen next. AlphaGo originally premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival this Spring and is currently in limited release in the US and UK. ", "title": "How will we face being defeated by machines?"}
