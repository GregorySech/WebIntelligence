{"title": "Show Notes: Congress just sold your internet privacy out from under you", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every chance I can, I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nHey \u2014 sorry for missing a few days there. I\u2019m still working out how to best deliver these. And when. Do you have ideas? Let me know. (Yes, email is a good idea. But what makes this the most valuable in an email? Curious for input there.)\nTHE WORST PR OUTCOME EVER\n\nEarlier this month, JetSmarter offered us a review ride on their private jet service... and sent us a contract requiring us to write a positive story within five days or pay them $2,000. We... did not do that.\nBut we wrote about that, and Ben Popper and Colin Lecher were inundated with customer and supplier stories about how JetSmarter was gradually increasing costs and reducing perks.\nAfter reporting it out, Ben and Colin discovered that JetSmarter is really quite shady \u2014 the company has customers sign an NDA that allows them to kick people out if they post negative reviews. Even on private WhatsApp chat groups for members. It\u2019s well worth a read.\nBut seriously, has any cold-call PR pitch ever gone so awry? Be, you know, smarter.\n\nGOODBYE INTERNET PRIVACY\nCongress voted today to repeal the FCC\u2019s privacy rules for ISPs, which means your broadband provider no longer has to ask your permission to sell your browsing data. Former FCC counselor Gigi Sohn wrote a great breakdown of what the bill does for us yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument (as always) is that free market competition will make these companies behave, because if consumers actually value privacy, they\u2019ll switch to providers that offer it.\nWhich, what are you smoking, first of all. The history of the internet is not the history of people knowing how to value online privacy. Come on.\nSecond, the fundamental problem with that is that most people don\u2019t have any choices for broadband providers. In New York City, tons of people can only get internet service from Spectrum. When I lived in Chicago, my only option was Comcast. Where is the competition to keep these companies honest coming from?\nYou have to willfully ignore the competition issues here. How much does that willful ignorance cost?\n\n\n\n.@boblatta is defending a bill to let AT&T (one of his biggest donors) sell your browsing history without your consent. #BroadbandPrivacy pic.twitter.com/oE9oodfyMK\u2014 Joshua Stager (@joshuastager) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nUgh. I hope everyone is ready for years of stories about bad ISP behavior, because that is the only reasonable check we have left.\nGALAXY DAY\n\nTomorrow is the big Galaxy S8 launch. I\u2019m really quite excited by it; it sounds like Samsung is trying to push a bunch of take-\u2019em-for-granted ideas about phones forward.\nVlad Savov wrote the essential pre-brief before the event: basically, Samsung has so much to prove with this phone, starting with that whole \u201cdoesn\u2019t explode\u201d thing.\nBut lots of other questions about the actual thing and how it works, even if we know the basics from leaks: is that no-home-button face-unlock actually any good? How does the DeX dock work? And on and on. Tomorrow will be a big day, even if we already know how the phone looks and most of the specs. How the product actually works is all too often taken for granted.\nWe\u2019ll have wall-to-wall coverage of the event and the device, so don\u2019t look anywhere else. Ever. Just keep reading our desktop home page, forever.\n(Also, there\u2019s a lot of snarky jokes about Samsung\u2019s plan to sell refurbished Note 7s under a different name in countries outside the US, but the company says it\u2019s doing it for environmental reasons, and that\u2019s pretty valid. There are millions of these things, and now that the root cause of the battery issue has been discovered, it\u2019s probably better to have them be useful than throwing them in a landfill. I doubt they\u2019re going to make a big deal about this.)\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nAndy Rubin teased his new Essential smartphone yesterday. Another new phone I\u2019m actually excited about \u2014 Rubin is one of the few people who\u2019s done this successfully more than once. \niOS 10.3 hit overnight, with a huge upgrade to the iOS filesystem. But... can you think of a quieter set of Apple announcements in a while? A new iPhone, a new iPad, and a huge update to iOS (sure, to a system-level thing, but still) and basically no hype around it. Wonder if the company is saving the buzz for something else, or if there just wasn\u2019t enough of a narrative around the new stuff for it to create buzz.\nNetgear expanded the Orbi line of mesh WiFi routers with a new wall plug module, which is fascinating. The Plume system is based entirely on little plugs, but there\u2019s something really powerful about a range of access points in all shapes and sizes creating a mesh. \nSpaceX is about to relaunch of of the Falcon 9 rockets it recovered on Thursday, which will make history. Loren Grush and Miriam Nielsen are on the scene for us, and we\u2019ll have blowout coverage of the launch. See, some things are still incredibly inspiring and wonderful.\nFinally, you can harvest your pet\u2019s fur and wear it as a watch band, which proves that innovation isn\u2019t dead. It is alive, in the form of literal hair products. (This is probably an April Fools joke, but I couldn\u2019t resist.)\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.\n\n\n\nemail address...\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n    By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n"}
