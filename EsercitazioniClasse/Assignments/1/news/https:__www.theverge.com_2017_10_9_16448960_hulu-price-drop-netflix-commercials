Variety reports that Hulu is attempting to build its subscriber base in advance of its new fall programming.After the first year at $5.99 per month, Hulu subscribers will be bumped up to $7.99. As Variety points out, Hulu offered a similar deal for new subscribers last fall.Last month, Hulu announced that it had budgeted around $2.5 billion for original programming in 2017. Hulu’s biggest breakout original so far is The Handmaid’s Tale, which won the streaming service its first Emmy (and several Emmys) last month. But the company has more originals on the way, including a Stephen King anthology series with J.J. Abrams attached to executive produce. As for non-original content, Hulu recently added a slew of hugely popular sitcoms, like How I Met Your Mother, M*A*S*H, and Glee. The deal will remain available to new subscribers until January 9th, 2018. The Verge has reached out to Hulu and will update with any new information.Correction, 3:26PM ET: An earlier version of this story stated that the price drop came after Netflix had increased its prices, but Hulu actually soft-launched its price drop at the end of September.
