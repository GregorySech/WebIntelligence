{"title": "The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is the best way to play Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "content": " \nOne of the most surprising things about the Nintendo Switch\u2019s Joy-Con grip \u2014 the standard controller that comes with the console \u2014 is that it works at all. The controller amounts to essentially a plastic shell with two Wii remote-like Joy-Con controllers snapped to each side. At first, it doesn\u2019t feel so different from any other modern controller. But after an hour or so, its compromises are noticeable. It\u2019s cramped for one thing, forcing you to hold your hands very close together. It also lacks a proper directional pad, and several buttons can be awkward to reach.\nThese faults become especially apparent when you\u2019re binging on a game like the lengthy adventure of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But there\u2019s a solution: the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\nIt just feels better\nLike its Wii and Wii U predecessors, the Switch\u2019s Pro Controller is Nintendo\u2019s attempt to add a more traditional control option to its lineup of motion wands and tablet controllers. The result is a sort of mash-up between Sony\u2019s Dual Shock 4 and an Xbox One controller. (The Pro even features subtly textured grips just like the latest version of the Xbox\u2019s gamepad.) But what\u2019s most important is how it\u2019s different from the out-of-the-box Joy-Con grip setup. The most noticeable thing is that the Pro is wider, so your hands sit more comfortably apart. This extra room also means that the buttons and sticks are comparably spread out, placed in more natural positions. Overall it just feels better, with a more solid design and better realized layout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Joy-Con grip configuration\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\n\nFor Breath of the Wild, these changes are especially important. The game features a surprisingly complex control scheme. While exploring, you need to constantly swap between avoiding attacks, shooting arrows, swinging a sword, and more. With the Joy-Con grip this can be a bit cumbersome; the tiny face buttons mean that occasionally I will jump when I mean to attack, or throw my sword when I\u2019m really trying to pull out a bow and arrow. These misfires are relatively rare, but nonetheless frustrating. It\u2019s no fun dying in battle because you accidentally hit the wrong button.\nIt\u2019s no fun dying in battle because you accidentally hit the wrong button\nAnother thing you\u2019ll be doing regularly in Zelda is pausing to load its menus. Pressing the + button lets you save, interact with your inventory, and check your objectives, while the - button brings up your map, which you\u2019ll need to check constantly. The Pro puts these two buttons in a much more natural spot in the middle of the controller, easily accessible by your thumbs, while on the Joy-Con grip they\u2019re awkwardly placed close to other buttons and one of the joysticks. The same goes for the screenshot button \u2014 a feature that seems tailor-made for Breath of the Wild\u2019s many beautiful vistas \u2014 and the Switch\u2019s home button. Both are in a weird spots at the bottom of the controller with a Joy-Con grip, while the Pro Controller places them in a more accessible area just below the + and - buttons.\nNone of these issues are huge, glaring flaws. Breath of the Wild is perfectly playable with the controller that comes with the Switch. The same is probably true for most other Switch games, though I haven\u2019t been able to test any others just yet. But an experience like Zelda \u2014 a massive open world that will likely take you dozens of hours to complete \u2014 those tiny flaws become magnified. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who has been waiting years to explore the latest rendition of Hyrule for dozens of hours, dropping an extra $70 on a fine-tuned controller might be a solid investment.\n\nNintendo Switch First Look\n\n\n\n\n"}
