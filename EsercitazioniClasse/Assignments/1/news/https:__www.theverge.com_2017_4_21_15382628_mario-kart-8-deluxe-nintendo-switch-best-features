{"title": "The 7 best things about Mario Kart 8 Deluxe", "content": " \nThree years ago, I felt comfortable calling Mario Kart 8 on Wii U \u201cthe best Mario Kart ever.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a drastic shift for the long-running series, but more of a refinement. From the twisting, gravity-defying tracks to game-changing new weapons to the vibrant and beautiful levels, Mario Kart 8 took almost everything I loved about the series and made it better. Mario Kart 8 went on to become the beleaguered Wii U\u2019s best-selling title by a huge margin; more than half of 13 million people who owned the console also had a copy of Mario Kart 8.\nNext week the game is getting a chance to reach even more players with the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s largely the same game from 2014, but with a few important changes and additions that make this the definitive version. The best Mario Kart is now even better \u2014 here are the most important reasons why.\nYou can hold two items at once\nThe biggest gameplay change seems like a small tweak: you can now hold two items at the same time. The improvement is significant. It alleviates one of the few problems with the original version of the game. Now, if you\u2019re holding onto a useful item like a fire flower or a super horn, you don\u2019t have to use it in order to pick up another item.\nUnfortunately you can\u2019t swap between the two items. But the ability still adds an extra layer of strategy to an already well-tuned experience. I found myself trying to collect two sets of turtle shells or bananas, using them as a defensive shield once I darted ahead of the pack.\nAlmost everything is unlocked from the start\nWhen you start Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, you\u2019re greeted with a huge roster: there are 42 characters in total, including a handful of new additions. All of them are available from the beginning. Unlike in the original Mario Kart 8, you no longer have to spend hours grinding through the Grand Prix mode to unlock new characters or race tracks for multiplayer. That said, you\u2019ll still need to collect coins in order to gain access to new vehicles and parts, but having so much content available right away makes it easier to jump into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, especially for those who already played plenty of the Wii U version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\nIt goes where you go\nLike most Switch games, Mario Kart 8 benefits a great deal from the console\u2019s portability. It may be best-known as a console series, but with Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 7, Nintendo produced some of its best entries for handhelds. It\u2019s a game that works well on the go, though fans of the early entries may prefer playing split-screen crowded around a TV. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe allows for both. \nFinally, a proper battle mode\nThe original Mario Kart 8 was an incredible racer, but it lacked one big thing: a robust battle mode. The mode was technically included, but was seriously lacking in options. It also re-used race tracks from the main game, which weren\u2019t ideal for all-out battles. Deluxe fixes this with eight arenas designed specifically for battle mode \u2014 four new, four based on arenas from previous games \u2014 and five different kinds of battles. \nMost of the new battle options are pulled from previous Mario Kart games, but my favorite is new. Called \u201crenegade roundup,\u201d the mode gives each player a chomping piranha plant, and the goal is to snap up as many members of the opposing team as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart steering makes it easy for kids to play\nOne of the new additions to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is something called \u201csmart steering.\u201d Essentially, the feature makes it easier to stay on the track, subtly correcting your steering to avoid accidents. When you couple this with the automatic acceleration option, you have the perfect racing game for kids. Now they can just focus on guiding the kart and using items.\nWith both of these features switched on, my four-year-old daughter managed to get through an entire grand prix and finish in fourth place; not bad for her first time playing the game. Even better, these options can be switched on individually for each player, making it easy for players of different skill levels to play together.\nYou get all of the downloadable content\nThe original Mario Kart 8\u2019s downloadable content added many new tracks and characters, some from outside of the Super Mario universe. You could race as Zelda\u2019s Link through quaint towns based on Animal Crossing, and there was even a fast-paced track based on futuristic racer F-Zero \u2014 probably the closest we\u2019ll get to a new F-Zero game anytime soon. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes all of these add-ons in addition to the main game, so you\u2019ll get an extra 16 tracks and an oddball mix of Nintendo characters right out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a word: inklings\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn\u2019t introduce any new tracks, but it does include a handful of new items, characters, and vehicles. There\u2019s the Boo ghost power-up that steals items from other racers, and you can now drive as Baby Bowser or the skeletal turtle Dry Bones. By far the best addition, though, is the inklings from Wii U paint shooter Splatoon. These human-squid hybrids are some of Nintendo\u2019s best new characters in years, and with their colorful, competitive nature they slot seamlessly into the world of Mario Kart. Let\u2019s hope this is just a step towards Inkling Girl joining the cast of Super Smash Bros.\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe is coming to Nintendo Switch on April 28th.\n"}
