{"title": "Musicians balk at SXSW contract that warns visiting artists about deportation", "content": " \nA clause in the SXSW artist contract appears to threaten international artists by giving festival staff the right to contact immigration authorities. In a series of tweets sent this afternoon, Told Slant\u2019s Felix Walworth announced they were canceling the band\u2019s showcase because of issues with the festival\u2019s contract. Walworth shared a screenshot of what is apparently the contract that says international musicians on a visa who \u201cadversely affect the viability of their official SXSW showcase\u201d could be deported if they play unauthorized shows. \n\u201cAfter looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw [sic] I have decided to cancel Told Slant's performance at the festival,\u201d Walworth wrote. \u201cI'm not interested in aligning myself with an institution that interacts with immigration authorities as a means of controlling where art is shared and performed, and who makes money off of it.\u201d\n\n\nAfter looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw I have decided to cancel Told Slant's performance at the festival pic.twitter.com/rI2Xv0duJl\u2014 Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Austin 360, SXSW co-founder Roland Swenson responded to Walworth\u2019s tweets, saying that they gave \u201ca much worse impression than what is real\u201d and noted that the clause has actually been in festival contracts for years. SXSW has never alerted immigration authorities in the past, he said, and doesn\u2019t plan to unless an artist does something \u201chorrific.\u201d He said that the clause specifically mentions unofficial showcases because most artists aren\u2019t traveling on a work visa, and don\u2019t get paid to play.\nJoey DeFrancesco of the band Downtown Boys, which has played SXSW in the past, also pointed out on Twitter that a similar clause has appeared in SXSW\u2019s contracts for years, but this is the first time it seems to have gotten a widespread reaction. Criticism over the contract comes during a period of heightened fear for immigrant communities in the US. Trump\u2019s recent immigration ban, coupled with increased activity by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could potentially be a catalyst for unfounded threats toward immigrants. \nIn a post-Trump era, it looks different than how it was intended\n\u201cIn the post-Trump era, it looks different than how it was intended, and how it was received in the past,\u201d Swenson told Austin 360. \u201cBut we\u2019ve come out strongly against the travel ban, and we\u2019ve really been going the extra mile to make sure these bands don\u2019t get screwed over when they enter the country.\u201d\nIn a statement to The Verge, Swenson called the backlash a \u201cmisunderstanding of our policies\u201d:\n\nWe understand that given the current political climate surrounding immigration, the language that was published seems strong... We hope never to be put in the position to act on this. Indeed, we spend a great deal of time communicating with international artists concerning numerous issues, including how to avoid issues at U.S. ports of entry. \nMoreover, there is language in the Performance Agreement which is included to inform foreign artists that the U.S. immigration authorities have mechanisms to create trouble for artists who ignore U.S. immigration laws.\n\nStill, SXSW\u2019s aggressive wording in its contracts feels unusual, especially for a festival that benefits from its many international showcases. \nDowntown Boys\u2019 Victoria Ruiz started an online petition today asking SXSW to remove this clause from the contracts. \u201cSo many of the artists playing the festival are addressing and confronting the very power structures that SXSW is perpetuating through their threats,\u201d Ruiz told The Verge in an email. \u201cThey are a festival, not law enforcement.\u201d\nOn Twitter, Walworth is encouraging other artists to ditch the festival as well. In an email to The Verge, Walworth confirmed this was going to be the band\u2019s first year playing at SXSW.\nUpdate February 2nd, 6:30PM ET: Updated to add comment from Roland Swenson / SXSW.\n"}
