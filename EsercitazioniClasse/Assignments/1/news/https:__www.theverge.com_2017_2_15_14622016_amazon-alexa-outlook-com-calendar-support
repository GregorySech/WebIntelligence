{"title": "Amazon's Alexa now supports Outlook.com calendars", "content": " \nAmazon has silently updated its Alexa assistant this week to add Outlook.com calendar support. While the digital assistant has supported Google calendars since its launch, Outlook.com support had been missing until this week. You can use Alexa to add or review upcoming events in a calendar using commands like \u201cwhat\u2019s on my calendar?\u201d or \u201cadd an event to my calendar.\u201d\nYou won\u2019t need to update any Alexa-powered devices as Amazon has added the Outlook.com support in the background. You can add Outlook.com calendars from the Alexa app for iOS or Android, or on the web under settings > calendar. \n"}
