{"title": "How climate change will affect the quality of our water", "content": " \nLast year, slimy green and foul-smelling algae took over Florida\u2019s beaches, releasing toxins that killed fish and shellfish and sickened people. The algal bloom prompted the Florida governor to declare a state of emergency and likely caused widespread economic damage. If climate change goes unchecked, we could see more of these algal blooms along our coasts and in lakes, according to new research. That means that climate change won\u2019t just affect the quantity of our water supply \u2014 causing drought, for instance \u2014 but it will also affect its quality.\nA study published today in Science shows that, in the future, more rain and more extreme storms will wash out increasing amounts of nutrients like nitrogen into rivers and coastal waters. Nitrogen is food for tiny algae, called phytoplankton \u2014 and when it\u2019s washed ashore, it can feed algal blooms like the ones in Florida. (Warming ocean waters are also to blame.) Using several climate models and projections, researchers showed that nitrogen runoff could increase by nearly 20 percent in the continental US by the end of the century \u2014 with the upper Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin and the Great Lakes seeing the largest increases.\nNitrogen is food for tiny algae\nNitrogen leaches into waterways from a variety of sources: farmers use it to fertilize crops; animals and humans produce it naturally in their poop; and nitrogen compounds are produced when we burn fossil fuels. Whenever it rains, this excess nitrogen (and other nutrients like phosphorus) are washed up from the soil and air into rivers, lakes, and ground water, and eventually into the sea. Here, nitrogen can do great damage: not only can it cause algal blooms, but when those algae die, they sink to the bottom and decay, using up oxygen in the process. This creates areas of low oxygen where fish and shellfish can\u2019t survive. Algae blooms can disrupt fisheries, causing millions of dollars in lost revenue, and cut drinking water supplies.\n\u201cThere are huge impacts that go much beyond what you would think of, oh well, it\u2019s just nitrogen in the water,\u201d study co-author Anna Michalak, a professor of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University, tells The Verge. \nAlgal blooms and so-called dead zones \u2014 like the one in the Gulf of Mexico or Chesapeake Bay \u2014 are on the rise, and not just in the US. The world\u2019s population, with all its nitrogen-rich waste, is increasing; and agriculture is spreading and becoming more intensified. As a result, we\u2019re pumping more and more nitrogen into the environment. But what\u2019s going to happen in the future? For this study, researchers at Stanford and Princeton wanted to understand how climate change will affect nitrogen runoff \u2014 and as a consequence, water quality. \nMichalak and her colleagues analyzed 21 different climate models to see how rainfall is likely to change by mid-century and by 2100. If we do nothing to address climate change, there\u2019s likely going to be more rain almost anywhere in the US, except in the Texas area. There are likely also going to be more extreme storms, especially in the Midwest and Northeastern US. Even if the amount of nitrogen we put in the environment doesn\u2019t increase, and we don\u2019t do anything to address the problem, the increased rain will carry more nitrogen into waterways, the study found. The Northeast could see an almost 30 percent increase in nitrogen runoff, the upper Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin a 24 percent increase, and the Great Lakes a 21 percent increase, the study says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maps on the left show how rain will increase (blue) and decrease (red) if we don\u2019t address climate change, by midcentury (map A) and by the end of the century (B). The maps of the right show changes in extreme storms in the spring.\nImage: Science\n\n\n\u201cThe one-sentence takeaway would be that we already have a nitrogen problem in the US, as many places in the world. [And] it\u2019s only going to get worse because precipitation is going to increase,\u201d says Ellen Douglas, an associate professor of hydrology at the University of Massachusetts Boston, who did not take part in the study. There are other factors that can make the effects of this nitrogen overload even worse \u2014 like rising temperatures. Algae, for instance, grow faster when it\u2019s warmer. But this study is only taking rain into consideration. The projections also assume that the amount of nitrogen we\u2019re dumping into the environment will stay the same, but we know that it\u2019s likely going to increase given our booming population and rising food demands, Douglas says.\nYet, the study is \u201cthe most comprehensive examination\u201d of how climate change and rain will affect nitrogen runoff, says Denise Breitburg, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, who did not take part in the study. The results also show that water quality isn\u2019t just a local issue, it\u2019s affected by how humans are changing the climate globally, Michalak says. \nwater quality isn\u2019t just a local issue\nMichalak hopes that policymakers will use the results to inform strategies to reduce how much nitrogen we produce. Local governments in the US are already trying to address the problem \u2014 by implementing better septic systems, for instance, or working with famers to determine how much fertilizer is applied, when, and where. In the Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin, farmers are already trying to reduce nitrogen input by 20 percent compared to 1980\u20131996 levels, according to a mandate by the Environmental Protection Agency. But to meet that target in the future, considering climate change, they should reduce nitrogen input by over 60 percent, the study says.\nThere\u2019s always the option of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, of course. But keeping nitrogen at bay is also key. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep dumping our waste into the environment, whether agricultural or human-based waste,\u201d Douglas says. \u201cWe need to find ways to reduce that flux of nitrogen.\u201d\n"}
