{"title": "Federal court blocks Trump\u2019s revised immigration ban before it begins", "content": " \nA federal judge in Hawaii has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration\u2019s revised travel ban from taking effect, according to The Washington Post. The ruling, by US District Judge Derrick K. Watson, froze the travel ban before it was scheduled to take effect at midnight. \nWatson was one of three judges to hear arguments against President Trump\u2019s executive order on Wednesday, with hearings in Maryland and Washington state also taking place. Lawyers for the state of Hawaii, which filed the lawsuit, claimed that the revised executive order was \u2014 much like the original executive order \u2014 essentially a Muslim ban, as it targeted citizens of six-Muslim majority countries, and thusly violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\nThe revised executive order, entitled \u201cProtecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d calls for the suspension of the US refugee program for 120 days, bans the issuance of new visas for citizens of Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, and Sudan for 90 days, and cuts the number of refugees allowed to enter the US in 2017 from 110,000 to 50,000.\nThe block of the revised travel ban is a major blow the Trump administration, which designed the second ban to pass the judicial scrutiny that brought about the demise of the initial order. This fight isn\u2019t over yet \u2014 it\u2019s likely that the White House will argue to have the executive order reinstated. \n"}
