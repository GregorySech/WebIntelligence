{"title": "Sorry, space cats, this interactive A-Ha video is the best use of ARKit we\u2019ve seen", "content": " \nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of serious, business-y applications for iOS 11\u2019s ARKit framework, but bless humans, because it\u2019s also being used for very important and practical things like space cats and little BB-8 sidekicks.\nNow, Chicago-based TRIXI studios has seemingly done the impossible and created an application for ARKit that is more monumental than space cats (and cats are one of the pillars of the internet) \u2014 an augmented reality version of A-Ha\u2019s iconic sketch video for \u201cTake on Me.\u201d\n\u201cWe had portals in [first-person shooter] PHANTOGEIST on Project Tango last year,\u201d TRIXI founder Chip Sineni tells The Verge, \u201cand instantly thought of the \u2018Take on Me\u2019 video... When ARKit came along, we were very excited by the idea that just \u2018normal\u2019 phones could do such great AR, so it seemed like the perfect situation to stress test what ARKit could do.\u201d\nA-Ha\u2019s original video, a short-form piece where a comic book character comes to life and falls in love with a girl, took months to make with its thousands of hand-drawn sketches that were then applied to a live-action shoot with rotoscoping. TRIXI\u2019s take only took a couple of days. \u201cThe hardest part was not having the all the live video receive the post effect,\u201d says Sineni. \u201cBut [we] really wanted that effect of turning your world into the \u2018Take on Me\u2019 experience, not a baked in experience.\u201d\nThe TRIXI team says the video was all possible with purchases from Unity 3D\u2019s Asset Stores. GameFlow was utilized for visual scripting, the characters and animations were done using Mixamo, and then AI assets were used to give them logic. \u201cIt is crazy how asset stores have democratized code and art for game making,\u201d says Sineni, \u201cthat anyone can do this so quickly now.\u201d\nTake that, space cats.\n\n"}
