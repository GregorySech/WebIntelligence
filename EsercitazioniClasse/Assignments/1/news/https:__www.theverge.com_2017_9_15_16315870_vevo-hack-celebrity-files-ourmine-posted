{"title": "Hackers dumped Vevo\u2019s celebrity dossiers after a company rep questioned their skills", "content": " \nThe hacking group OurMine has been breaking into company networks and social accounts for years, usually inflicting more embarrassment than outright damage \u2014 but when they gained access to Vevo servers last night, the company somehow managed to provoke something worse. \nAccording to a screenshot posted by OurMine, the group contacted a Vevo representative at 6:10PM with news of the compromise, only to be met with profanity and disbelief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, OurMine posted 3.1 terabytes of data from Vevo\u2019s servers, a leak first reported by Gizmodo. Browsable from OurMine\u2019s site, the data included Vevo\u2019s private dossiers on 90 different artists, including Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, One Direction and U2. Other documents included social-media strategy memos and instructions for disabling the office\u2019s alarm system.\nDespited the public airing, OurMine insisted they would delete the data if contacted by a Vevo representative \u2014 and they seem to have kept their word. This morning, the data abruptly disappeared from the site. A new message on explained, \u201cwe deleted the files because of a request from VEVO.\u201d Attempts to access the data redirected to a Vevo-branded Box login page.\nOurMine didn\u2019t explain how they\u2019d gained access to the data, but in a statement to Variety, Vevo attributed the compromise to \u201ca phishing attack through LinkedIn.\u201d\nVevo joins a long string of companies compromised by OurMine, which typically uses high-profile targets to drum up interest in legitimate security products. Last month, the group compromised both the WikiLeaks website and various HBO-linked social media accounts. Previous targets include Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey.\n"}
