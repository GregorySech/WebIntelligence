{"title": "An afternoon with one of Spotify\u2019s \u2018Badass Women,\u2019 a 20-year-old New Yorker with one pop-rock anthem", "content": " \nTwenty-year-old singer-songwriter Samia has three songs on Spotify, and each has basically nothing to do with the others. \nOne is a folk ballad about friends dying young from drug abuse, painted with broad strokes Biblical imagery. Another\u2019s a life-or-death torch song for Father John Misty, titled \u201cThe Night Josh Tillman Listened to My Song.\u201d The third, released this April, is \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys,\u201d a bubbly pop-rock tirade about dudes who won\u2019t stop talking. You could call it an anti-mansplaining anthem \u2014 one that offers up a handful of pretty good burns. The chorus is simple enough to be immediately satisfying, and the first time it hits, its delivered in a flat, pleasantly rude monotone: \u201csomeone tell the boys they\u2019re not important anymore.\u201d The second time, the delivery builds from a snarky lilt into a full-on belt. \nIt\u2019s this song, its unlikely placement on one of Spotify\u2019s curated playlists, and the flurry of tweets it elicited from amped-up young women on the internet, that made me ask her if she might want to hang out. \n\u201cForget it, I\u2019m never going to work with anybody who\u2019s mean to me again.\u201d\nOn a Thursday afternoon in September, when Samia wanders up to my picnic table on the corner of 1st Street, she\u2019s dragging a backpack and wearing a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce Girls Girls Girls t-shirt cut off in the middle. It was clearly broken-in a long time ago, and probably not by her, and she\u2019s paired it with pinstripe pants, white high-tops, and tall orange socks. She\u2019s also carrying a black jacket that she slides into as the afternoon turns colder, saying, \u201cthere\u2019s a cool thing on the back.\u201d It\u2019s a portrait of David Bowie.\nIt\u2019s a look, for sure. A young-and-making-music look. She also has a balloon of dark hair, a surprisingly low, confident voice, an oddly comforting presence, and soft spots for Kesha, Charli XCX, and Miley Cyrus \u2014 though she just downloaded Nirvana\u2019s entire discography onto her phone and also worships Courtney Barnett. Also Janis Joplin. And Rihanna and Bob Dylan. \nSamia says she wrote \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d in response to a bunch of male musicians she was collaborating with \u201cwho fancied themselves really knowledgeable and important.\u201d She woke up one morning determined to write away all the boys who were rude or condescending, whether professionally or romantically: \u201cI was like, forget it, I\u2019m never going to work with anybody who\u2019s mean to me again. And also never date anyone who\u2019s mean to me again.\u201d A few weeks later, she found out that \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d had been plopped onto Spotify\u2019s \u201cBadass Women\u201d playlist. She was sitting in her parents\u2019 bedroom, scrolling through the stats on her distribution site, and noticed that she\u2019d jumped from about 3,000 streams total to 13,000 streams for just that day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months later, \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d has been streamed about 160,000 times, which is nothing more exciting than \u201crespectable.\u201d Spotify\u2019s playlists have made much bigger hits than this, and a bonafide Cinderella story on the platform would see \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d perform well enough to get bumped up to bigger and bigger playlists. So far it hasn\u2019t, though it made its way onto Discover Weekly playlists throughout the summer and hasn\u2019t been cut from \u201cBadass Women\u201d yet. \nWhat\u2019s interesting to me about Samia \u2014 a New Yorker who can\u2019t wait to turn 21 just so she can get into a bar to charge her phone, never mind getting her friends into 21-and-up venues to see her play \u2014 is that this little blip might determine the course of her career anyway. \nI found Samia in my Discover Weekly playlist in July \u2014 not on \u201cBadass Women,\u201d which I don\u2019t follow. But it\u2019s likely that her placement in my Discover Weekly was a ripple effect from that initial placement. As The Verge\u2019s Ben Popper reported in September 2015, Discover Weekly takes advantage of the fact that Spotify\u2019s 100 million users are making their own playlists constantly. Simply put: the algorithm can find other users whose taste is similar to yours, then pull tracks from their playlists, taking cues from how they\u2019ve arranged and paired songs you might like, then repackaging them and serving them to you as a personalized Monday morning treat. In Discover Weekly\u2019s algorithm, Ben wrote, \u201cEach time a user with similar taste playlists a certain song, it\u2019s a vote that the song will sound good to you when paired with other tracks on that playlist.\u201d \n\nSamia\u2019s song was likely plucked from \u201cBadass Women\u201d and indirectly picked out for me by some stranger who, like me, listens to a lot of guitar music made by women, has put Mitski\u2019s Puberty 2 on at least 14 playlists in the last year, started digging back into Taylor Swift\u2019s discography in June (like a sucker), and has never met a kiss-off track she didn\u2019t like. That would pretty much explain why Samia noticed that almost all of her new fans are young women.\nIt took weeks to pick out an afternoon for us to meet, because even though Samia left her contemporary music program at the New School last year, she\u2019s been incredibly busy. To make money while she figures out the music stuff, she\u2019s been doing a lot of acting. (It helps that her mother is Kathy Najimy, a character actress best known for Hocus Pocus and Sister Act). She\u2019s part of the ensemble in Sarah DeLappe's new play The Wolves, a New York Times Critic\u2019s Pick about a high school soccer team, and she has plenty of friends who need warm bodies for short films. \n\n\nHey! If you've found my music through a Spotify playlist can you let me know which one? Thaaaaaaank you!\u2014 Samia (@samiatheband) July 17, 2017\n\n\n\nA representative from Spotify told me that Samia\u2019s song was discovered by the \u201cBadass Women\u201d curator by pure chance: \u201cShe has an internal tool that can group tracks according to sub-genres, and she basically was listening through all the new releases that week looking for songs that fit the mood of the playlist she curates.\u201d Obviously the origin story of any musician is full of these weird little moments of luck and happy accident, but in the streaming age it\u2019s possible (and pretty simple) to click a few links, send a few emails, and easily trace things all the way back to the beginning. There\u2019s a little bit less magic involved, as there\u2019s a digital record and a logical series of events. \nThe algorithm has other little consequences too. Samia considers herself a folk singer first, interested in writing \u201clyrically obscure, verbose, Dylan-esque songs,\u201d and that\u2019s the vast majority of what she\u2019s been performing, bopping between Midtown lounge The Cutting Room and any Lower East Side or Williamsburg 100-capacity venue that will have her. \u201cSomeone Tell The Boys\u201d is totally different. It\u2019s a bouyant, forceful, slightly over-sung command that\u2019s punching up even as it\u2019s inviting Samia\u2019s new teenage fan base right on in. You can imagine a nouveau feminist pop star like Hailee Steinfeld singing this song. In fact, Steinfeld\u2019s most recent single \u2014 \u201cMost Girls,\u201d released the same month as \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d \u2014 is also meant as a rebuttal to dumb boys talking. \n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see what those companies are interested in me for, based on that song.\u201d\nNow Samia is getting attention from management companies and record labels, all of which want her for something along Steinfeld\u2019s lines. \u201cThey\u2019ve all come through Spotify,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich means they\u2019ve come through \u2018Someone Tell the Boys,\u2019 which is the song that\u2019s done well there. It\u2019s interesting to see what those companies are interested in me for, based on that song.\u201d She tells me she doesn\u2019t plan to choose between folk and pop, but then she contradicts herself a little bit: When I ask if the popularity of \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d will affect how she thinks about what to write next, she nods, \u201ccertainly.\u201d \u201c\nOf the \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d she\u2019s heard so far, she says, the recurring theme is: \u201cWho the fuck are you? You need to be more clear.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWandering around the Lower East Side, past bars we can\u2019t go into, though they radiate historical significance pertaining to many of Samia\u2019s musical heroes, I tell her about the morning I played \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d for a dude. He rolled his eyes like of course you would like this song and then he said \u201cOf course you would like this song.\u201d She laughs, but she\u2019s unsurprised and unmoved. \u201cThere are a lot of dudes who feel that way about the song,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. I was just watching the Lady Gaga documentary and she said something like \u2018My threshold for dudes has considerably shrunk in the past couple of years.\u2019 I really empathized.\u201d She adds that she noticed that her song was shared on Reddit, but she didn\u2019t bother to read any of the comments. \n\u201cI love social media, I spend a lot of time on social media, but I have no idea how to use it to my benefit,\u201d she says. \u201cI sort of just post shit, and stare at it, and try to not delete it.\u201d \n\u201cI love teenage girls. Everyone expects them to be crazy, so they give themselves permission to be ridiculous.\u201d\nOn that note, I ask her, what\u2019s she doing about Twitter? \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d has attracted a small but eager fanbase of teenage girls, who Samia hears from mostly in tweets. She wasn\u2019t expecting them, after years of playing folk songs in New York and opening for her friends\u2019 band AJR, a sort of Vampire Weekend-aspiring trio of brothers with a small claim to fame thanks to a lead single that sampled SpongeBob Squarepants. But as an effusive Harry Styles fan herself, she has a lot of respect for the power of a fandom made up of young women. \u201cI love teenage girls,\u201d she says emphatically, shaking her head while she bumps the ice cubes around a glass of tea. \u201cEveryone expects them to be crazy, so they give themselves permission to be ridiculous. That\u2019s kind of empowering.\u201d \nShe admires Harry Styles she says, because nobody else in the world is \u201ctrying to be a rockstar right now.\u201d His \u201870s pastiche debut album came out in May, and her favorite song is \u201cKiwi,\u201d a doofy classic rock banger about a girl who pairs \u201chard liquor\u201d with \"a bit of intellect.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tell her what I tell everyone the first time I meet them, which is that that there\u2019s a life-size Harry Styles cut-out on the wall in my bedroom and it\u2019s a joke but only kind of. Without breaking eye contact, she ups the ante with a truly remarkable story about fandom, recounting how she begged her boyfriend to sublet the apartment of a female musician she admires, so that she could go over and touch the woman\u2019s things. \u201cI should stop telling people that the first time I meet them,\u201d she laughs, ripping a bite off of a croissant. This is the moment in our conversation where it hits me that Samia can be massively popular if she wants to be. Teen girls love her now, with one not-quite-viral song on the books. They don\u2019t even know yet that she totally gets it.\nIt probably doesn\u2019t even matter that she had no idea that Spotify playlists could make a difference for a song until \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d ended up on one, or that she had no idea that she could have a teen girl fanbase until that playlist served her to them. \u201cThe algorithm stuff is awesome, but I\u2019m so not a mathematical person and I don\u2019t understand marketing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m confident in myself as a performer so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d She made her website herself, and the music video for \u201cSomeone Tell the Boys\u201d was shot by her friend Kayhl Cooper. \nThey haven\u2019t really figured out how to put it online yet. \n\n"}
