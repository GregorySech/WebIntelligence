{"title": "Google Motion Stills update fixes yet another thing about Apple\u2019s Live Photos", "content": " \nMotion Stills, the excellent Google app for iOS that stabilizes iPhone Live Photos and lets you share them as GIFs and videos, has a new update out that fixes another annoyance with Apple\u2019s occasionally useful camera feature. \nHave you ever taken a Live Photo where the canonical \u201cmain\u201d frame just isn\u2019t the one you wanted? Where your subject\u2019s expression was captured at the least flattering nanosecond, for instance, or where rapidly changing ambient light shrouded your photo in darkness at just the wrong time?\nMotion Stills now fixes that by letting you choose any frame from your Live Photo and re-export it with that frame as the primary image. You can scroll through each captured frame with a simple slider, and the exported image works like any other Live Photo \u2014 but now you don\u2019t always have to 3D Touch the screen to see the moment you wanted.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nGoogle is making better apps for the iPhone than for Android\n\nThere is a catch. For space reasons, Live Photos only save the primary frame in full 12-megapixel clarity, with the other frames handled as lower-resolution video; choosing one of these frames will therefore result in a photo with less detail than the original. But since the vast majority of Live Photo viewing probably happens on phones, this may not be a major issue for you.\nIf you ever shoot Live Photos and you haven\u2019t downloaded Motion Stills yet, it\u2019s well worth doing so right away. As ever, the features work retroactively with all the Live Photos that are already in your library; the single scrolling stream is getting a little unwieldy at this point, but perhaps that\u2019s something for a future update.\n"}
