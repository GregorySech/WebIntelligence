{"title": "The original Sarah Connor is returning in a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day", "content": " \nJames Cameron has been working on relaunching the Terminator franchise, and the original Sarah Connor will be returning in the first new film. According to The Hollywood  Reporter, Cameron announced yesterday that series star Linda Hamilton would be reprising her role in the as-of-yet untitled film, alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger. The last time all three collaborators worked on a film in the franchise was some 26 years ago \u2014 in 1991\u2019s Terminator 2: Judgement Day. \nEver since that movie, a number of sequels and attempted reboots have rolled off the assembly line, but none of the efforts were as memorable as the two original films. The most recent entry, Terminator: Genisys, tried to reboot the franchise with an alt-timeline take that recast Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke in the Connor role. That film tanked at the box office, and plans for subsequent films were scrapped.\nThe return of Cameron has resulted in an entirely different game plan. According to the Reporter, the new movie will be a direct sequel to Judgement Day, ignoring all subsequent non-Cameron entries, and will kick off a trilogy of new films designed to transition the franchise from Hamilton and Schwarzenegger to a younger cast. Cameron and Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller, who will be directing the first sequel, assembled a writers room to break the story for the new trilogy. Some of those involved included The Sarah Connor Chronicles creator Josh Friedman, Dark Angel co-creator Charles Eglee, and prolific TV and film writer David S. Goyer. It\u2019s the same kind of workshop approach that Cameron used for Avatar, which in that case resulted in a total of four planned sequels. \n\nDuring the Terminator announcement, Cameron reportedly touted the cultural importance of the Connor character returning, particularly in an older incarnation. \"As meaningful as she was to gender and action stars everywhere back then, it\u2019s going to make a huge statement to have that seasoned warrior that she\u2019s become return,\" he\u2019s quoted as saying. \"There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys, but there isn\u2019t an example of that for women.\u201d\nAs my colleague Tasha Robinson noted in a recent conversation, that would seem to indicate that Cameron hasn\u2019t been keeping up with Helen Mirren\u2019s work in the Red franchise. But it\u2019s also somewhat difficult to take his statements at face value given recent comments he\u2019s made about Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman. Last month, Cameron was criticized for calling that film \u201ca step backwards\u201d for female heroes because Wonder Woman was portrayed as both powerful and attractive, something that has always been an intrinsic part of that character. \nThe comments about Connor\u2019s return almost come off like the filmmaker trying to capitalize upon a cultural moment in which strong female heroes are being brought to the forefront. That said, given Cameron\u2019s larger track record \u2014 he not only created Sarah Connor, but turned Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Ellen Ripley into a gut-toting warrior in Aliens \u2014 there is definitely reason to celebrate Linda Hamilton\u2019s return to the franchise in this way. And anything that erases the last three Terminator sequels from memory is more than welcome.\n"}
