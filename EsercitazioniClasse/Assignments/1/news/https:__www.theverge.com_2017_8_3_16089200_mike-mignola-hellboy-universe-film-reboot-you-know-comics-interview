{"title": "Hellboy creator Mike Mignola on the future of his shared universe, and the film reboot", "content": " \nIn 1993, writer-artist Mike Mignola introduced comic book readers to Hellboy, a demon discovered and raised by American soldiers after World War II that ended up fighting against forces attempting to take over the Earth. It was an almost immediate hit, and Mignola went on to expand the world with an array of new characters and a related comic series. \nOne big part of that universe has been a series called B.P.R.D., which follows the titular government agency dedicated to protecting the country against paranormal threats. Mignola brought Hellboy\u2019s story to a close with Hellboy in Hell a couple of years ago, and this month he launched a new arc called The Devil You Know that will bring B.P.R.D. to an end as well. \nI spoke with Mignola about what it\u2019s like to say goodbye to beloved characters, what\u2019s next for the sprawling Hellboy universe, and what fans can expect from Neil Marshall\u2019s upcoming film reboot, Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen.  \nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.  \nYou ended Hellboy\u2019s story with Hellboy in Hell in 2016. What made you want to give the character a definitive end? \nHellboy in Hell was was supposed to be a series with a lot of one- or two-issue stories, but it turned into what I didn't want it to turn into: one big story. I restructured it a couple of times to be one of three books, and there was just a point where I realized that it\u2019s here where our story comes to an end.\nI had to scrap some stuff I planned to do, but I analyzed what I wanted to do and realized it was just more of the same. It felt ready to wrap this up. It\u2019s one thing I always try to do with all of these books \u2014 it\u2019s the case with B.P.R.D., too \u2014 where these things are going, but you try not to put too tight a rein on it. Sometimes it turns out longer than you thought it would be. You look around and go, \u201cOh, that guy is now where he needs to be, that guy is now where he needs to be.\u201d \nSort of like a road trip, where you plot out where you want to go, but let it play out on its own. \nYeah. You say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us six months to travel the country,\u201d but in reality, it takes you two weeks, because it turns out that it\u2019s just a big fucking desert. \nThe larger Mignola-verse isn\u2019t over with the end of Hellboy. Are you surprised at how this world has evolved and grown over time?\nI hate to say Mignola-verse. It\u2019s spooky whenever I use it! It\u2019s certainly nothing I ever imagined doing, and the thing I\u2019m most proud of \u2014 and I wish I could take all the credit for it \u2014 is the fact that it\u2019s all happened very organically. The beauty of being able to do stories set in various time periods and stuff, they all work together really well. There's still a lot of ground to cover.\nTwenty-five years of Hellboy, B.P.R.D., and related books... you can read all that stuff and it's a coherent, complicated story. That\u2019s not something I ever set out to do, but I\u2019m happy with how it turned out. I just don't think there's anything like that in comics right now, now that Marvel and DC keep scrapping their continuities and starting over. \nOn a logistical level, how do you keep your continuity and characters straight? \nWe did this book a few years back, The Hellboy Companion, for us. We would say things like, \u201cWe know in one of the books, we established the year Abe Sapien was found,\u201d but we would always forget what book that was in. So we came up with a book with a timeline. There are also people online who keep track of this stuff. [Dark Horse Comics Executive Senior Editor] Scott Allie is very good at keeping track of that.\nWhat\u2019s worked really well is that we\u2019ve only had me, [writers] John Arcudi, Chris Roberson, and a couple of others work on the whole run of this series. We haven't had to bring in an outside guy that we had to bring up to speed on continuity.\nAs this became a big, sprawling story, how did you keep it true to your original vision?\nI\u2019ve always been the broad-strokes guy. I do have specific things I wanted on the books I worked on. When we expanded to B.P.R.D., the first couple of books with John [Arcudi], I was much more heavily involved as co-writer, but at some point, I realized I had a general direction of where the B.P.R.D. story would go, and a general idea of how it would ultimately end.\nWhen John committed to the book, I very quickly stepped back and said, \u201cI want you to feel like this is your book.\u201d I encouraged him to create his own characters or mess with the ones I created, and not just write the stories I was telling him to write. I always feel like I get the best work out of people if they feel like they\u2019re creating the work themselves. It keeps me surprised at how things are going, and I figure if I\u2019m surprised, the reader will be surprised. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Dark Horse Comics\n\n\nThe Devil You Know is the next big story arc for B.P.R.D. It comes after the big Hell on Earth arc, Hellboy in Hell, and the end of the Abe Sapien run. How did you guys develop this ongoing storyline, and what do you hope it will do?\nJohn Arcudi had been writing the book forever, and at some point, he just felt he had done everything he wanted to do. So when he decided to wrap up Hell on Earth, we were really in a funny spot with, \u201cWho do we get to finish this thing?\u201d I always knew we had one big arc left to do, and he didn\u2019t leave where it ended.\nScott Allie was just finishing up Abe Sapien, and we talked about bringing in a new writer. But it\u2019s almost a closed shop, and it\u2019s not fair to a new writer to say they have to close up the book. So I asked Scott if he could just close it out. He\u2019s been involved since the beginning, and he\u2019s been keeping track of all the plot threads for 20-some-odd years. I think he was relieved I asked him. \nThat\u2019s made it comfortable, because we did have a pretty clear idea of the broad strokes of this last B.P.R.D. arc, so I spent a couple of days talking with him about what would happen next. \nWhy do you think it\u2019s time to close up B.P.R.D.?\nWe\u2019ve done a lot of damage to the world and characters, and I\u2019ve had this story in mind. You look around and go, \u201cOh, all the pieces are lining up the way they\u2019re supposed to.\u201d We\u2019ve gone back and forth on the length of the series. We didn\u2019t want to wrap it up super-fast, it was just: \u201cHere\u2019s what needs to be done, now see how many issues that needs to be.\u201d You don\u2019t want to keep something running artificially long. I think that\u2019s something that separates us from mainstream comics. If you want to do a world and characters that evolve, you have to let them do so at their own pace.\nThe beauty is that we have this Hellboy and the B.P.R.D. series that Chris [Roberson] is writing, where we\u2019re filling in this gigantic gap between Hellboy\u2019s first appearance to when the first comic was published, which takes place in the \u201890s. That\u2019s 40 to 50 years of untold stories. There\u2019s definitely places to go beyond where B.P.R.D. is. There\u2019s also the Victorian era that hasn't been fleshed out. There's prehistoric stuff I'd love to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Dark Horse Comics\n\n\nHow are you balancing writing a story that appeals to new readers and to longtime fans?\nYou know, I\u2019m probably not great at that. The thing we\u2019ve always tried to do is say that you don\u2019t need to read what\u2019s come before to understand what\u2019s happening, but I think that, as we\u2019re wrapping things up, we\u2019re trying to recap where it fits with the series. For example, with some of the characters that have been gone for a while, we try and explain what\u2019s gone on with them. \nIt seems as though you have prefigured the modern movie cinematic universe concept like Star Wars or Marvel, where they establish a framework to drop stories into. \nI was reading Marvel comics in the \u201870s, and one of the things that was great about those stories was that they felt like a whole giant world. You could read Captain America and find stories about him in the 1940s. Then, you find out that there were other characters in the \u201840s, and what happened them. You got the sense that this was a big populated world with a history that made sense. Now, most of that is pretty much gone now, but that\u2019s the feeling that I\u2019ve tried to keep with Hellboy and B.P.R.D.\nWhat I didn\u2019t want to do is a story that begins in Hellboy but continues in [the spinoff series] Lobster Johnson. My feeling was if you want to read B.P.R.D., you\u2019ll get as much as you need to make the story work. But the more of these books you read, the more you see the history and how the threads connect. \nSort of an anti-Marvel Civil War concept. \nI never want to do comics where it feels like a trick to get readers to buy books that they don\u2019t want. If you hate the 1930s, you don't want Lobster Johnson. That\u2019s fine. If you don\u2019t give a shit about the Victorian era, don\u2019t read Witchfinder. But if you do read Witchfinder, you find threads that connect to Hellboy and B.P.R.D. You\u2019ll find a consistent history behind everything, but you\u2019re not missing much if you don\u2019t read the entire thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Dark Horse Comics\n\n\nYou\u2019re back to writing full-time on a couple of new books, like Koshchei the Deathless. What\u2019s that about?\nThat's a six-issue miniseries that I wanted to do for a long time. Once Hellboy was wrapped up, I told [illustrator] Ben Stenbeck I would finally write that book. I first introduced Koshchei in Hellboy. He\u2019s a Russian folklore character, but I created an origin that draws on a couple of different folktales. There's a tremendous amount of great, weird stuff in Russian folklore, and the more I read, the more I realized that it just scratches the surface. People have called Hellboy an antihero. If Koshchei is a hero at all, he\u2019s an extremely anti-hero. He\u2019s a very dark character who\u2019s done a tremendous amount of really dark things.\nHellboy really began to draw on Russian folklore later in the series. What draws you to it? \nMonsters. Russia just has fantastic stories about monsters. Norse mythology was always my favorite because they're the best monsters, and Greek mythology has always had terrific monsters, but I\u2019ve always been put off by the costumes they wore. I wasn\u2019t familiar with the Russian stuff, but I did like Baba Yaga. When I began using her, I started looking at Russian folklore to flesh out her story, and discovered all this other stuff. \nI love those bizarre, rambling folklore tales where a person has to go to this place to get directions to go to that other place, where they get a magic ball of string they have to follow. So I like to embrace the really odd parts of the story. I\u2019m hoping the overall feel of this new miniseries will feel like a Russian folktale set in the Ozark mountains. \nI just saw that Ian McShane is joining the cast of the new Hellboy movie. How closely are you involved with the new film?\nI\u2019m a weird kind of co-executive producer. I\u2019m not actually sure what my title is, but unlike the del Toro movies, where I was active in pre-production and design, I\u2019m not doing that this time around. When the decision was made to do another movie, I got involved, basically saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do that story, don\u2019t do this, or that, change this, and that.\u201d I helped to steer it. Christopher Golden and I did write a couple of drafts of the screenplay and got it on track, and then the decision was made to do a reboot. I really just get questions about how things work, and while I\u2019m not doing a lot, I\u2019ve been talking with the creature-design guy and the makeup guy to get the look of Hellboy and his hand, and things like that. \nThe film is aimed at an R rating, as opposed to the del Toro films which were PG-13. What are you hoping this will bring to the story? \nThat\u2019s been the feeling from day one. It\u2019ll lean in the horror direction, more so than the fantasy direction del Toro was doing. When Neil came on, we decided to go for an R rating, so he doesn\u2019t have his hands tied, and so he can go as dark and as tough as he wants to go. I was a fan of his, and when he came onboard, I thought it was terrific: now it\u2019s really going to be an action-horror film. \nIt\u2019s not that we want to wallow in blood, but when you do a PG-13 rating, you bang your head into rules about how intense certain things can be. I think it helps that Deadpool and Logan were R-rated, and what I\u2019ve been telling people is that the tone of it will be much more the Logan approach: lean, dark, tough, and not something that stops to show limbs flying through the air. \nIs there anything you\u2019ve learned from Hellboy and B.P.R.D. in the last 20 years that is now translating into the film?\nYeah. It\u2019s a very loose adaptation of one of the Hellboy graphic novels. When you have more books out there, you have a lot more to sift through. You can look around at how big the world is, and borrow pieces from here and there. You want to sell a larger world, but you have to pick and choose what goes in there. The challenge for us has been to not lose sight of the specific story, but suggest the elements of a larger story. My hope is that this introduces a lot of stuff that then expands into a Hellboy Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nA rebooted Hellboy is the final nail in the coffin for Guillermo del Toro\u2019s third film\n\n\n"}
