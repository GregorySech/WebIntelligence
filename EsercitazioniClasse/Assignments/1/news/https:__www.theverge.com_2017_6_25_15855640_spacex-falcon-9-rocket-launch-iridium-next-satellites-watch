{"title": "Watch a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch 10 satellites into orbit", "content": " \nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch later today carrying a new batch of satellites into orbit for communications company Iridium. After takeoff, SpaceX will try to land the Falcon 9\u2019s first stage \u2014 the 14-story-high core of the rocket that contains the main engines and most of the fuel \u2014 on an autonomous drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. If successful, it\u2019ll be the 13th time SpaceX has successfully landed one of these rocket stages, and the eighth time it\u2019s performed the feat at sea.\nThis is the second launch SpaceX is attempting in one weekend \u2014 the quickest turnaround ever. (Launches are weeks or months apart, usually.) On Friday, SpaceX sent a Bulgarian communications satellite into space from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, in what the private spaceflight company called a \u201cweekend doubleheader.\u201d That flight was supposed to occur last weekend, but it was pushed back so that a valve could be replaced in the fairing, which is the cone at the top of the rocket that holds the satellite. On Sunday, Elon Musk said that the rocket has also been equipped with \u201csignificantly upgraded\u201d fins made of titanium, which replaced aluminum fins that were prone to catching fire during reentry. \n\n\nFlying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. https://t.co/SmyCCQRt2F\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 25, 2017\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s launch is part of Iridium\u2019s plan to create a large constellation of 66 telecommunications satellites in lower-Earth orbit called Iridium NEXT. It will deliver mobile voice and data coverage all over the planet, including over the ocean and at the poles. The first 10 satellites were launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket in January; today\u2019s launch will bring the number of satellites in space to 20. When fully completed, the constellation will also be used to provide a minute-by-minute tracking system for airplanes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket that launched the first 10 Iridium NEXT satellites in January.\nPhoto: SpaceX\n\n\nIridium has six more launches scheduled with SpaceX over the following 12 months, CEO Matt Desch said during a call with reporters on June 19th. \u201cOur network activity in space is really going to get a bit frenetic here in the coming months,\u201d Desch said. As these new satellites go up, they will slowly replace the old-generation satellites \u2014 some of which have been in orbit since the 1990s.\nAll Iridium NEXT satellites will be launched on new Falcon 9 rockets \u2014 at least for now. Desch said he\u2019s open to the possibility of launching on already-flown Falcon 9s, if the reused rockets can speed up the schedule. \u201cSchedule for me is very, very important,\u201d Desch said. \u201cCost and risk are aligned,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe the risk is low right now but it\u2019s not zero, because it\u2019s a new thing.\u201d \nSpaceX completed its first landing of a Falcon 9 first stage in December 2015, and has completed 12 so far, including one on Friday. Two of these recycled rockets have been successfully launched and landed so far. Friday\u2019s rocket that carried the Bulgarian satellite to space was actually the same Falcon 9 that put the first 10 Iridium NEXT satellites in orbit in January.\nToday\u2019s Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 4:25PM ET, with an instantaneous launch window. The backup date is Monday, June 26th at around the same time. Check back this afternoon to watch the mission live. The live broadcast begins 20 minutes before launch.\n\n\n"}
