{"title": "The fight for net neutrality is officially back on", "content": " \nAfter months of blunt force foreshadowing, the Federal Communications Commission announced today that it\u2019s ready to pick a fight with the public over the future of the open internet. It\u2019s great news if you\u2019re a lawyer for Verizon or Comcast, and terrible news for the rest of us. \nIn its first wave of propaganda, the FCC says that its proposal to roll back internet regulation will \u201cRestore Internet Freedom for all Americans\u201d \u2014 a mendacious slogan on the level of the \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d or the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Healthcare Plan.\u201d Like the first fight for net neutrality, this one is going to be about words and what they mean. For instance: \u201cinternet freedom.\u201d\nWhat does the FCC mean now when it talks about \u201cinternet freedom?\u201d Here\u2019s what Chairman Pai\u2019s office said today in a press release: \n\nChairman Pai is now setting the FCC on a course to fix the problems that the prior FCC created.  His plan to restore Internet Freedom by repealing Obama-era Internet regulations will benefit all Americans. \nIt will restore Internet Freedom by ending government micromanagement and returning to the bipartisan regulatory framework that worked well for decades.\n\nThis is the same tired line that Republicans have been trotting out for years, and it\u2019s based on a dumb, misleading conflation of \u201cthe internet\u201d with \u201cthe behavior of internet service providers.\u201d The current net neutrality rules already give consumers \u201cinternet freedom\u201d by restraining internet providers from dividing the internet into a nightmare of toll zones and walls. Net neutrality rules aren\u2019t \u201cgovernment micromanagement,\u201d they\u2019re the exact opposite: they are a condition of possibility for the competitive anarchy that has defined the internet and allowed companies to rise and fall without permission from their ISP. \n\u201cTitle II regulation\u201d simply gives the FCC the authority to make sure those ISPs are behaving \u2014 a power the Republican-controlled FCC wants to relinquish to the very companies they\u2019re supposed to monitor. \nChairman Pai said as much earlier this month when he floated the nonsensical idea that broadband providers self-regulate by putting net neutrality provisions in their terms of service agreements. Here are just some of the things those broadband companies have done in the past 10 years:\n\nDeliberately throttled internet traffic\nLied about throttling internet traffic\nSqueezed customers with arbitrary data caps\nMisled consumers about the meaning of \u201cunlimited\u201d internet\nGave privileged treatment to vertically integrated companies they own\nStrong-armed cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet\nFought against being held accountable as public utilities, while profiting from public utility regulations\nFought and killed privacy rules that protected customer web browsing data\nHeld customers hostage to make Netflix pay up\nLied about net neutrality rules hurting network investments\nAvoided real competition at all costs\n\nThe FCC wants to put these companies in charge of the internet. Let\u2019s work together to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Tell the FCC we\u2019re not going back. \nYou can contact FCC chairman Ajit Pai and let him know what you think by emailing him: Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov. You can also call the FCC at 1-888-225-5322. At the prompt, press 1, then 4, then 2, then 0 to be connected to an agent and file a complaint. \n"}
