{"content": " \nThe nine-episode second season of Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things will begin streaming on October 27th. It\u2019s been more than a year since the kids from Hawkins first faced the otherworldly monsters from The Upside Down. The show was a huge success, and this new season faces enormous expectations from fans. \nStranger Things\u2019 eight-episode first season leaves off after the Hawkins kids confront The Upside Down\u2019s Demogorgon and a slew of federal agents trying to contain the situation. Meanwhile, Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) travel to the other world, where they finally discover and rescue Joyce\u2019s son Will. The monster discovers the kids, but Eleven destroys it and vanishes. The show then jumps forward a month, showing that everything is starting to get back to normal, until Will coughs up a slug-like creature and has a vision of the world he just escaped. It\u2019s a clear setup for more dealings with The Upside Down and its creatures.\nHere\u2019s everything that we know so far about what to expect from this next season. Caution, there are likely some light spoilers ahead.\nThe second season takes place about a year after the events of the first\nSeason 2 begins on Halloween 1984, about a year after The Upside Down first threatened Hawkins. Will has been trying to cope with his experiences. According to series co-creator Matt Duffer, he\u2019s been seeing images of the place, and it \u201cseems like he\u2019s having some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d The other kids are mourning the loss of Barb Holland and Eleven.\nJoyce has begun dating a former classmate, Bob, while Hopper is trying to keep the events from season 1 under wraps. As we\u2019ve seen in the first teaser trailer and Comic-Con trailer, those events aren\u2019t going away, and there appear to be bigger problems on the horizon. \nThematically, season 2 is a movie sequel\nThe Duffer Brothers have said on a couple of occasions that they had an idea of where the show would go after season 1. Since the first season was loosely modeled after films like E.T., Alien, and The Goonies, the second season is modeled after sequel films like Aliens or Terminator 2. The Duffer Brothers singled out James Cameron as a huge inspiration: \u201cOne of the reasons his sequels are as successful as they are is, he makes them feel very different without losing what we loved about the original.\u201d\nRecently, Finn Wolfhard (who plays the Stranger Things\u2019 Mike Wheeler) described the second season as \u201cStranger Things but just sorta hopped up a little. It\u2019s almost like season 1 was drinking a Coke and season 2 they drank a Red Bull.\u201d\nExpect season 2 to be more horror-oriented\nAs the action and drama in season 2 is ramped up from the first, expect it to be darker and more oriented toward horror, according to Wolfhard. That shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise, given what the characters went through. Netflix has teased much bigger challenges ahead for the kids and the town of Hawkins. \nIn this more horror-flavored season, we know to expect a couple of big things: Will Byers will continue to deal with the fallout of his time in The Upside Down, and the characters will be going back there, according to the trailers. People around Will aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s going on with him; we\u2019ve seen him visiting doctors, but they\u2019ll quickly realize that the events of season one aren\u2019t past them yet. \nWe can also expect a much bigger monster: a spidery shadow creature that Will sees in visions, which we\u2019ve seen in various trailers for the next season. According to TV Guide, the show\u2019s young stars say it\u2019s horrifying, and they refer to it as \u201cThe Shadow Monster.\u201d In the latest trailer, Hopper says, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was before: it\u2019s grown,\u201d which certainly sounds like he\u2019s talking about a creature. \nThe entire cast will be back, including Eleven\nWhile Eleven vanished at the end of season 1, it shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise that she\u2019s back. Netflix released an image back in November that featured the entire cast, and she\u2019s since appeared in the season\u2019s first trailer. In particular, we know Eleven will be returning because we\u2019ve seen her in the trailers, but Netflix also released a clip that shows how she gets back to the real world.\nThe one exception to the \u201ceverybody\u2019s back\u201d promise: Barb. She\u2019s apparently really dead, but her death will have a major impact on the events of this season. \nThere will be a bunch of new characters\nWhile season 1 introduced audiences to an excellent cast and their characters, season 2 will bring in a bunch of new faces. One look at an episode\u2019s script reveals Keith, an arcade employee.\nThere are also some big names joining the show. Sean Austin (Lord of the Rings, The Goonies) will play Bob, Joyce\u2019s former classmate and now boyfriend. Paul Reiser (Aliens) will play a \u201chigh-ranking member within the Department of Energy,\u201d who is in town to help contain the mess made in season 1. Danish actress Linnea Berthelsen (The Desert) will play a character named Roman, \u201can emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child.\u201d Comedian Brett Gelman will appear as Murray Bauman, a former journalist who peddles conspiracy theories, who happens to be in town investigating a cold case.\nAlso joining the character roster are Max and Billy. Max (played by Sadie Sink) is described as a \u201ctough and confident 13-year-old female.\u201d She\u2019ll be a series regular. Billy (played by Dacre Montgomery) is her stepbrother, a \u201csuper muscular, overconfident 17-year-old.\u201d\nWe know the titles of all the episodes, and who\u2019s directing them. \nWhen Netflix announced the show would get a second season, it did so with a short video that revealed the titles for season 2\u2019s episodes, which seem to contain some references. But the company apparently recently changed that lineup, and a new tweet introduced the current titles for the first six episodes: \n\n\u201cMadMax\u201d\n\u201cTrick or Treat Freak\u201d\n\u201cThe Pollywog\u201d\n\u201cWill the Wise\u201d\n\u201cDig Dug\u201d \n\u201cThe Spy\u201d\n\nThe tweet says the last three episode titles are unknown, but here\u2019s what was originally listed: \n\n\u201cThe Secret Cabin\u201d\n\u201cThe Brain\u201d\n\u201cThe Lost Brother\u201d\n\nWe also know who\u2019ll be directing them: while the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy are returning to helm most of the season\u2019s episodes, the show has attracted some big names, such as Pixar director Andrew Stanton, who will direct two episodes.\nThere are plenty more nostalgic references\nThe first teaser trailer opened with an Eggo waffle commercial, and cameos of classic video games such as Dragon\u2019s Lair, Galaga, Asteroids, and Pac-Man. Cultural references have always been a part of Stranger Things\u2019 marketing, with posters that harken back to Stephen King and tons of classic 1980s horror movies.\nSynth band SURVIVE will once again provide the score\nThe first season\u2019s soundtrack was an unexpected delight, provided by synth band SURVIVE, which is returning to provide the score for season 2. The soundtrack will be out on October 20th, and the track listing features some minor spoilers. From the sounds of things, it\u2019s going to keep the same tone and feel.  \nWe already know a third season is on the way\nThere are nine episodes in this next season, but fear not: we know that the show is already coming back for a third season. It doesn\u2019t have a release date yet, but given the voracious appetite for the show, we\u2019ll probably be seeing hints about plans for that season as soon as the second season airs. \nThere\u2019s likely still more to come: Ross Duffer teased the possibility of a fourth season earlier this year, telling Vulture, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out.\u201d Matt Duffer added: \u201cWe just have to keep adjusting the story. Though I don\u2019t know if we can justify something bad happening to them once a year.\u201d \nAnd there\u2019s been some talk about a fifth season as well: producer Shawn Levy told EW that \u201chearts were heard breaking in Netflix headquarters when the Brothers made four seasons sound like an official end, and I was suddenly getting phone calls from our actors\u2019 agents.\u201d He says \u201cthere\u2019s very much the possibility of a fifth. Beyond that, it becomes I think very unlikely.\u201d\n", "title": "Everything we know about Stranger Things\u2019 second season (and beyond)"}
