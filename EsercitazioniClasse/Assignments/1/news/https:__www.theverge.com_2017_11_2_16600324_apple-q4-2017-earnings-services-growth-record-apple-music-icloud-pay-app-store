{"title": "Apple makes more money with services than AirPods, Apple TV, Watch, and iPad sales combined", "content": " Apple announced today that revenue from its services division came in at $8.5 billion in the past quarter, a 34 percent year over year increase. That revenue is now more than both iPad and Apple\u2019s \u201cother products\u201d division \u2014 which includes AirPods and other accessories, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPod touch, and Beats products \u2014 combined. The news was part of the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings results. Apple\u2019s services division has been the company\u2019s second strongest source of revenue behind iPhones since April 2016, when it first surpassed Mac sales. Services include Apple Music and iCloud, which the company said saw a 75 percent subscriber growth, though it did not specify just how many users that number entails. Apple also saw more downloads and longer time spent in the App Store following a redesign announced at WWDC and launched with iOS 11 in September. Citing App Annie\u2019s latest estimates, App Store revenues are nearly twice as much as the Google Play Store\u2019s, according to Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri.Lastly, Apple\u2019s services growth was also attributed to the expansion of Apple Pay to countries around the world, including Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the UAE in the last month. Stateside, Apple has worked with retail partners including supermarket chain Safeway to support Apple Pay, with rollouts beginning in October to eventually support all 912 stores in the US."}
