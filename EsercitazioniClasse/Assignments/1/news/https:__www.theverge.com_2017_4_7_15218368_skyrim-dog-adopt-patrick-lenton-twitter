{"title": "One man\u2019s quest to save his dog is still the most compelling reason to play Skyrim", "content": " \nA year ago, writer Patrick Lenton shared a story on Twitter about finding a dog in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Its owner was dead. He adopted it because he\u2019s \u201cnot a monster.\u201d He quickly grew to love this very good dog, which would eagerly (and at times foolishly) charge into battle with him. As Lenton started tackling bigger foes, like giants and very grumpy dragons, it became clear that his pooch was in danger. \nHe put aside his world-saving adventure to make a new home for his dog. It became a sprawling journey far more entertaining than the plot of Skyrim itself. \n\n\nworst part of Skyrim was when I found that dog whose owner died in a cabin, and then I of course had to adopt the dog bc i'm not a monster\u2014 Patrick Lenton (@PatrickLenton) April 5, 2016\n\n\n\nLenton\u2019s thread went viral on sites like BuzzFeed back in 2016, but it\u2019s resurfaced thanks to a tweet from Silicon Valley actor Kumail Nanjiani. It\u2019s impossible to verify that the situation played out exactly as Lenton tells it, though it does fit within the game\u2019s rules for pets: if you want a dog in your house, you need an adopted child to claim it. The thread is a wonderful story, if only for how well Lenton tells it. His simple wish to save his dog becomes a comedy of errors as he tries to build a perfect home, adopt kids, and hold together a happy family \u2014 going to any lengths for his pet. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Very Good Skyrim dog.\nImage: The Elder Scrolls Wiki\n\n\n\nLenton wasn\u2019t forced to adopt this dog. He\u2019d lose nothing if he let it die (except a piece of his soul, I guess). His struggle as a player is as admirable as it is hilarious, but it\u2019s entirely of his own making. It\u2019s a testament to the power of emergent stories, narratives that players themselves build in open worlds. Look no further than modern games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a Skyrim-like experience. The best moments in the game have nothing to do with following the main quest. They\u2019re about collecting horses, sharing unexpected deaths, or accidentally setting a forest on fire with a bear. \nI played Skyrim back when it was first released in 2011, albeit very briefly. I loved my Khajiit hero, Punkin, for his tufted ears and perpetually puzzled expression. I even enjoyed the game\u2019s variety of goofy bugs \u2014 except the one that stranded me on a mountain, after my horse inexplicably slid away as though it were on an invisible conveyor belt. But, eventually I got bored and ditched the game. My mistake here is a simple one: I never took the time to venture beyond the game\u2019s main objectives. I chained myself to the rails of a single ride instead of venturing through the entire amusement park. \nSkyrim came out about six years ago, but the game continues to thrive. It\u2019s been ported and remastered beyond its PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 launch to the latest generation of consoles. It\u2019s even coming to the Nintendo Switch. If you\u2019re curious why it endures after all this time, look no further than this story about a man and his virtual dog: a perfect and charming tale made possible by the weird possibilities of an open world.\nLenton has said on Twitter that even after all this time, he still gets chased away from the home he built. He might not see his dog again, but at least the story has a happy ending in real life. \n\n\n@PatrickLenton Dear Patrick,You're welcome.
