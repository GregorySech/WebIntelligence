{"title": "Anchor is like Snapchat stories for audio, and it\u2019s delightful", "content": " \nA year ago, a pair of New York entrepreneurs released Anchor, an app for recording short-form audio snippets that they hoped would \u201cdemocratize radio.\u201d \u201cAs popular as this medium is we feel it\u2019s really hard for regular people to contribute to it,\u201d co-founder Nir Zicherman told TechCrunch. The initial version of Anchor let you record \u201cwaves\u201d of up to two minutes, and anyone could add on with a minute of their own. I appreciated the democratic impulse, but the results sounded less like radio and more like extremely long voicemails. I recorded a couple of posts on Anchor but never found a reason to return; the app struggled to gain traction. \nBut today Anchor is back with a new version, and it\u2019s much more compelling than what came before. Anchor 2.0 is a kind of Snapchat Stories for audio, with users encouraged to create digital radio stations where content disappears after 24 hours. But the tools for audio creation are much improved, with features for easily adding full songs, professionally recorded transitions, and \u201ccall in\u201d responses from listeners. The result is a service that ditches the voicemail vibe of the original in favor of something much more entertaining. \n\u201cThe stories format helps create a consistent tone for each station.\u201d\n\u201cWhile Anchor 1.0 proved to us that non-professionals would be willing (and excited) to record their voice, it also showed us that the quality bar for user-generated audio needed to be much higher than content on visual mediums,\u201d co-founder Michael Mignano told me in an email. \u201cOne of the ways we tried to ensure that audio in 2.0 would be interesting and fun to listen to was by providing lots of creative tools for our users. We\u2019ve also found that the stories format helps create a consistent tone for each station, and encourages people to choose a topic instead of just saying whatever\u2019s on their mind.\u201d More creative tools are coming, he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnchor opens to the home tab, where you\u2019ll find updates from all the people and stations you subscribe to. (Anchor has signed up a number of professional publishers to create radio for it, including IGN, Gizmodo, and The Outline.) Tap on a station and it will begin playing with the most recent segment you haven\u2019t heard. Tap the skip button to move on to the next one if your bored, or the applause icon to express your approval. (As on Periscope, Facebook Live, and Medium Stories, you can send an unlimited number of likes on Anchor.) \nOnce the station runs out of segments, the next one will autoplay. Anchor also has categories for you to browse and discover new stations: news, tech, life, music, \u201cfunny,\u201d and so on. \u201cThe Rundown\u201d is a personalized station that offers you the day\u2019s news, plus weather from Dark Sky.\nInsert full songs into your station\nBut the app\u2019s best touches are in the creation tool, which you\u2019ll find by tapping the big red plus button at the bottom of the screen. You can record by tapping the button and dragging up, or by holding the phone to your ear, as if you were making a call. Swipe left and you\u2019ll find several tools to spice up your recording. \u201cClips\u201d lets you insert audio from newsmakers, broadcasters, and other Anchor users into your own station, giving you new voices and events to react to. Music lets you insert full songs into your station, though your listeners will need to be subscribers to Spotify or Apple Music to hear them. (Non-subscribers will hear a short clip.)  \nInterludes let you punctuate your broadcasts with the kind of professionally produced bumpers you hear on the radio, and \u201ccall ins\u201d let your audience record audio responses and submit them to you directly. If a caller makes a worthwhile point, you can tap a button to add it to your station. \n\nOn one hand, we\u2019re living in a glut of audio. Thanks to services like Spotify and an ever-increasing number of podcasts, few of us feel like we\u2019re short of things to listen to. And yet Anchor appeals to me for some of the same reasons Twitter and Periscope did: it offers the promise of timely, compelling broadcasts from smart, funny people who have an authenticity that more professionally produced content sometimes lacks.\nThe odds against any social app gaining traction are long, and audio clips don\u2019t go viral the way text, photos, and videos so often do. But Anchor has some bold ideas and a handful of genuinely delightful touches. (You can knock on the back of your iPhone to send applause.) And South by Southwest, which helped bring us Twitter, Foursquare, and Meerkat, starts in three days. If a social app were going to break out this year, this could be the time. \nAnchor is available on Android and iOS.\n\n"}
