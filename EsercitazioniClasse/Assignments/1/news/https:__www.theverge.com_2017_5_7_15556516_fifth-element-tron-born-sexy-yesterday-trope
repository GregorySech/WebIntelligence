{"title": "Why are some of sci-fi\u2019s beloved female leads deadly, beautiful, and hopelessly naive?", "content": " \nTron: Legacy\u2019s Quorra and The Fifth Element\u2019s Leeloo have a few things in common, despite their films being separated by 13 years. Both serve as supporting roles to fairly generic heroes; both are fierce and capable in combat; both have haircuts that would make the average person look incredibly stupid; and both are inexplicably wide-eyed about the world.\nJonathan McIntosh, who goes by Pop Culture Detective on YouTube, published a video exploring this trope, which he calls \u201cborn sexy yesterday.\u201d These female characters are wise, but also strikingly naive about the world. They\u2019re childlike, and yet they\u2019re also designed to appeal to heterosexual men.\n\u201cCharacters who are born sexy yesterday are often highly skilled at something that men will respect,\u201d McIntosh says. \u201cFrequently, that thing is combat.\u201d \nMcIntosh, who also worked on a few videos for pop criticism site Feminist Frequency, calls this phenomenon a relationship trope. It\u2019s not so different from the infamous Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype. Like the MPDG, a Born Sexy Yesterday character is typically introduced to a straight, \u201cred-blooded man\u201d who is alone or unhappy in the love department. He\u2019s directionless or disenfranchised with his life. But in the case of Born Sexy Yesterday, the trope goes a step further because this man, McIntosh says, \u201ceither can\u2019t find or doesn\u2019t want a woman from his own world who might be his equal in matters of love or sexuality.\u201d\nThe trope isn\u2019t new or even exclusive to sci-fi\nThe trope isn\u2019t new or even exclusive to sci-fi. McIntosh explores its history in films like Forbidden Planet or The Time Machine, as well as its appearance in mediums like anime. The problem with the trope, he says, is that its subtext is \u201crooted in a deep-seated male insecurity around sex and sexuality.\u201d The trope could improve, he posits, if both characters were inexperienced and explored their identities together, or if these women were given the chance to grow in their experiences \u2014 like Star Trek: Voyager\u2019s Seven of Nine.\n\u201cThe crux of the trope is a fixation on male superiority, a fixation with holding power over an innocent girl,\u201d McIntosh says. \u201cBut in order to make that socially acceptable, science fiction has employed to put the mind of that girl into a sexualized, adult women\u2019s body.\u201d \nThe trope does exist in reverse as well. Kind of. Men who exhibit the same traits in film, like Big or Blast from the Past, are more often used as the butt of the joke. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because most grown women don\u2019t find the idea of dating an inexperienced adolescent boy all that appealing,\u201d McIntosh says. Truer words have never been spoken. \n\n\n\n\n"}
