{"title": "Lyft's new Stranger Things ride mode sounds more unpleasant than scary", "content": " \nStranger Things returns on Friday, and the brands want us to know they\u2019re just as excited as we are to get back to Hawkins, Indiana. The most recent attempt to capitalize on the show\u2019s popularity comes from Lyft, with the launch of \u201cStrange Mode.\u201d \nOn Thursday, October 26th and Friday, October 27th, users nationwide will be able to opt into the mode from 6AM to 6PM, which will change Lyft\u2019s map so that cars are represented by waffles, Christmas lights, trucker hats, and the Stranger Things logo. Then on October 27th and 28th, riders in Los Angeles and Philadelphia will be able to take a Stranger Things-themed ride from 4PM to 9PM. According to Deadline, it will feature \u201cflickering lights, radio static, malfunctioning seats, a driver that vomits a slug in front of you, a pulsating ceiling, and an Eggo reward at the end.\u201d \nLyft has done these kinds of ride gimmicks before. In 2016, the company launched an April Fools\u2019-themed stunt called \u201cPrank Mode,\u201d and this past summer there was \u201cTaco Mode,\u201d which brought riders to a Taco Bell drive-thru for a Doritos Locos taco. \nBut Strange Mode is seemingly worse than the rest, because it doesn\u2019t just involve bad jokes or free tacos. It puts you through a riding experience explicitly designed to feel like you\u2019re going through the scary parts of a messed-up little town. There\u2019s a reason the Hawkins kids always run away screaming when stuff like this happens!\nDeadline reporter Dino-Ray Ramos, who got to test out the experience, described the ride as \u201cfun, scary, and bonkers,\u201d but I\u2019m assuming Ramos wasn\u2019t actually using Lyft to get anywhere. If you decide to use the service for your LA commute, it might not be much fun to be stuck with shaky seats, radio static, and a barfing driver while in rush-hour traffic.\nObviously Strange Mode is voluntary, but it would make the most sense to use it when you already need a ride, because you\u2019re still going to pay for it. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I think being stuck in a car is already enough of a terrible nightmare that I don\u2019t need the added stress of an aspiring actor / driver who\u2019s going to get lost, pull over, and start dry-heaving.\nBut maybe you have a Halloween party to go to before 9PM this weekend, and you\u2019d like to have a horrible time getting there. If so: enjoy!\n"}
