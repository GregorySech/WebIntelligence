{"title": "Everything you\u2019ll be able to stream before Disney leaves Netflix", "content": " \nDisney just announced a breakup with Netflix. The company will be launching its own standalone video streaming service sometime in 2019, which will be home to future theater releases including Frozen 2 and Toy Story 4 \u2014 plus Disney\u2019s vault of animated classic and new original content. \nBut that\u2019s two years away, and after hearing today\u2019s news, many Netflix customers are probably wondering how much longer they\u2019ll be able to stream Disney content. Fear not: it\u2019s not going away anytime in the near future. Netflix will continue to offer Disney movies from now until the end of 2019. That includes any new releases for the remainder of this year and all of 2018. So yes, Star Wars: The Last Jedi will eventually come to Netflix. But any film premiering in 2019 and beyond will not be available from Netflix. \nBelow you\u2019ll find a list of what else you\u2019ll be able to watch before these two companies go their separate ways. \nHow long will Netflix customers be able to stream Disney\u2019s movies?\nNetflix says its subscribers will be able to watch Disney movies on the service until the end of 2019. \nWhat upcoming Disney movies can I expect to see on Netflix?\nNetflix will be getting pretty much anything from Disney that\u2019s coming to theaters before the calendar moves to 2019. Recent and future releases include:\n\nA Wrinkle in Time\nAnt-Man and The Wasp\nAvengers: Infinity War\nBlack Panther\nCars 3\nCoco\nMary Poppins Returns\nMulan\nRalph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nStar Wars standalone Han Solo movie (untitled)\nThe Incredibles 2\nThe Nutcracker and the Four Realms\nThor: Raganok\n\nNote that if any of these movies are delayed into 2019, they will not be available from Netflix and will fall to the list below.\nMovies that won\u2019t be coming to Netflix as a result of this news include:\n\n\nAvengers 4 (untitled)\nCaptain Marvel\n\nDumbo (live action, directed by Tim Burton)\nFrozen 2\nStar Wars Episode IX\n\nThe Lion King (live action, directed by Jon Favreau)\nToy Story 4\n\nWhat about the Marvel shows on Netflix?\nA Netflix spokesperson told The Verge by email that \u201cWe continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts, including our ongoing deal with Marvel TV.\u201d You\u2019ve still got The Defenders to look forward to in August. That\u2019ll be followed by The Punisher, plus at least another season each for Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist. \nBut Disney\u2019s new plan for its own streaming service definitely raises questions about how much Netflix will be willing to invest in future projects. \n"}
