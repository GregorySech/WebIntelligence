{"title": "Show Notes: Google vs. Microsoft vs. Slack", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nGOOGLE VS. MICROSOFT VS. SLACK\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud services and enterprise conference started out extremely boring yesterday, but today was all action, starting with the news that Hangouts is turning into a full-on competitor to Slack.\nDieter\u2019s piece really gets into the messaging strategy mess Google\u2019s created for itself \u2014 it\u2019s quite a mess! But Gmail and Google Apps for business are still entrenched; building a messaging system around the email and calendaring system so many people already use is very smart, especially since Hangouts is also commonly used for quick video chats. The chaos of Google\u2019s consumer messaging strategy might have cleared out enough space for Hangouts to be a focused enterprise strategy.\nStill, I\u2019d bet that a lot of companies that use Google Apps also use Slack right now \u2014 and until the chat features of Hangouts have 1:1 feature parity with all the wacky Slack integrations and services, no one\u2019s going to be happy about switching corporate platforms just because it\u2019s slightly cheaper or comes from a single vendor.\nBut neat products like Google\u2019s new Jamboard whiteboard will certainly help.\nAs for Slack, it\u2019s now facing down two huge enterprise email / calendar providers in Microsoft and Google who can make a pretty convincing case that group chat is a terrific adjunct to email, not a complete replacement. Where does Slack go from here? What makes it a product, not just a feature? Slack\u2019s a smart company and I\u2019m sure they have answers, but it\u2019s not going to win by putting out more ill-considered full-page print ads in the Times.\n\nPOWER MAKES YOU DUMB\n\nLet\u2019s talk about powerful people making weird / bad decisions. First, the huge Samsung corruption lawsuit began today, and Sam Byford delivered a clear explainer of what\u2019s going on, who\u2019s implicated, and how it involves, um, horse racing. Samsung has always been sort of a faceless organization, and this new layer of shadowy drama will be hard to shake.\nScott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, denied that CO2 causes climate change today. This flies in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus \u2014 there is a good and robust policy debate to have about climate change and environmental policy, but denying the rate of change caused by human industrial production illustrated in this very good XKCD panel is just nonsense.\n\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nThe latest Fast and Furious 8 trailer is out, and it\u2019s full of... self-driving cars? Sure.\nMore cars! The Geneva Auto Show is still going on, and today Bentley came after Tesla with a hot new electric concept. This is sort of the same thing as Slack: Tesla created this huge new market, but established players can pick off customers at a variety of other price points. And this Bentley looks so hot.\nOver a hundred thousand people watched a block of ice melt because of Game of Thrones. The new season premieres on July 16th. This is our world now. \nFinally, here are two neat little wireless speakers: the new Tivoli Model One Digital and the Chromecast-based Mondo+. The overwhelming trend is to put enough smarts in the speakers to handle pulling the audio stream from the cloud directly instead of relying on a phone \u2014 it\u2019s all the same basic idea whether it\u2019s Spotify Connect or Google Cast or Sonos or whatever. Which make me wonder: what the hell is going on with AirPlay? Apple pioneered the idea of sending content from a phone to another device, and it\u2019s so far behind the state of the art now I don\u2019t even consider using it anymore. Are there still AirPlay fans out there?\n\n"}
