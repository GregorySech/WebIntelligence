{"title": "Watch Facebook\u2019s F8 2017 keynote live stream", "content": " \nFacebook\u2019s annual developer conference kicks off today, where we\u2019ll join CEO Mark Zuckerberg for more about where the company is going next with bots, Messenger, VR, and more. \nLast year, Facebook made its bot platform the highlight of the event, and since then tons of chatbots have flooded Messenger. (At least 11,000 bots were available by July 2016, and nearly tripled to 30,000 by September.) We even built our own Circuit Breaker bot for this year\u2019s CES coverage.\nSome of the more recent Messenger blog posts still encourage developers to build bots, so it\u2019s clear the company isn\u2019t ready to shove them aside just yet. It\u2019s what Facebook does to streamline the overabundance of bots that\u2019ll be interesting to see.\nREAD NEXT: INSTANT RECALL: Facebook's Instant Articles promised to transform journalism \u2014 but now big publishers are fleeing\n\nWe\u2019ll also hear what happens next with Facebook\u2019s VR efforts now that Palmer Luckey has officially departed from the company. F8 is one of the few events where Facebook talks about any of its hardware-related things, so expect to see updates on its open-source 360-degree camera as well.\nAlso on the F8 schedule is a discussion on Facebook\u2019s enterprise edition Workplace, and what the company plans to do to take on the likes of Microsoft Teams and Slack.\nAll this goes down later today and tomorrow. Here are details on how to follow along the news as they break.\nWHERE TO WATCH\nStarting time: Day 1, April 18th: San Francisco: 10AM / New York: 1PM / London: 6PM / Berlin: 7PM / Moscow: 8PM / Delhi: 10:30PM / Tokyo: 2AM (April 19th) / Sydney: 3AM (April 19th)\nDay 2, April 19th: San Francisco: 10AM / New York: 1PM / London: 6PM / Berlin: 7PM / Moscow: 8PM / Delhi: 10:30PM / Tokyo: 2AM (April 20th) / Sydney: 3AM (April 20th)\nLive stream: Facebook\u2019s live stream is available on FBF8.com.
