{"title": "Diesel\u2019s first Android Wear watch is available today for $325", "content": " \nDiesel is starting to release the first of its debut line of Android Wear watches, after announcing them back in March. The watches will all go under the name Diesel On Full Guard, and the first of them is being made available today, only through Macy\u2019s. That model will have a black case and a brown leather strap and will sell for $325.\nThe rest of Diesel\u2019s Android Wear watches will come out on September 25th. There will be four other models, and they\u2019ll all just have some basic style differences. There will be two with black leather bands, one with a gold metal band, and one with a black metal band. They\u2019re all running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, have a 48mm case, support IP67 water resistance, and promise a day of battery life.\n\n\n    Related\n  \nAndroid Wear now belongs to fashion brands, not gadget nerds\n\n\nDiesel is also releasing an Android app that\u2019s meant as a companion to the watch. It\u2019s supposed to send updates on things like your agenda, the weather, and fitness goals. The app is called T-ON-I, which is apparently meant to stand for \u201cTime, Organizing, Notification, Intelligence.\u201d I\u2019m entirely puzzled as to why it\u2019s split up by dashes, though, and I feel like I must be missing some clever way to pronounce it. Tee-on-eye? Why not just Tony? \nWhile these are Diesel\u2019s first Android Wear watches, they aren\u2019t the company\u2019s first smartwatches. Diesel already sells hybrid watches that do activity tracking.\nAnd really, while these are a first for Diesel itself, these are far from a first for Diesel\u2019s parent company, Fossil. Fossil has been making Android Wear watches for a couple years now, and this year, it intends to release more than 300 new smartwatches across its conglomerate of brands, which also includes Kate Spade, Misfit, Skagen, Michael Kors, and Tory Burch. Basically, it\u2019s just flooding the market with a ton of different styles.\nAndroid Wear has largely been taken over by fashion brands at this point, so it makes plenty of sense to see Diesel debuting its own \u2014 and putting them inside Macy\u2019s.\n"}
