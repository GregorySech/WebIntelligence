{"title": "The UE Wonderboom is the newest adorable member of Ultimate Ears\u2019 speaker lineup", "content": " \nUltimate Ears has a new entry-level speaker in its lineup: the $99 UE Wonderboom, and it\u2019s an adorable little fellow that replaces the UE Roll as the cheapest Ultimate Ears speaker.\nThe Wonderboom ditches the flying saucer form factor of its predecessor and instead looks like a shorter version of its UE Boom 2 and MegaBoom siblings, allowing it to offer a similar 360 degrees of sound. The Wonderboom is also a bit thicker than the Boom 2 \u2014 think around half a MegaBoom \u2014 in order to offer more internal space for the acoustic design. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize aside, the Wonderboom fits right in with Ultimate Ears\u2019 other speakers, with a variety of colorful acoustic fabric options, big rubberized plus and minus buttons for controlling volume, and an IPX7 waterproof rating. The end result is an almost spherical version of the other UE speakers that just feels really good to hold in your hand, like a baseball. \nThe Wonderboom also has a few extra touches that bring some small but significant quality of life changes to the brand. In addition to a power and Bluetooth pairing button, the Wonderboom finally a third \u201cUE\u201d button that can be used to play, pause, and skip tracks on a connected device. That UE button can also be used to pair up multiple Wonderbooms without requiring the use of a companion smartphone app. And like the Roll, the Wonderboom has a small bungie cord for hanging it from things, and can float in water. \nOf course, the Wonderboom\u2019s great design isn\u2019t worth a whole lot if it doesn\u2019t sound good. Fortunately, Ultimate Ears\u2019 audio pedigree is just as strong in its newest and smallest speaker, with the Wonderboom offering strong, clear sound in my time with it, even at lower ranges (something that smaller speakers traditionally struggle with). And while it might not be quite as loud as its larger counterparts, it still offers more than enough power to fill a decent-sized room.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Ears is claiming up to 10 hours of battery life for the Wonderboom, and says that the speaker can work up to 100 feet away from a Bluetooth source. Speaking of Bluetooth, that\u2019s your only option for connecting to the Wonderboom, as the speaker ditches the 3.5mm headphone jack. And while USB-C may be getting more popular in the overall industry, it hasn\u2019t made its way to Ultimate Ears\u2019 speakers yet \u2014 the Wonderboom still chargers over Micro USB. \nThe Wonderboom will be released in April and will come in six colors: Stone (gray), Phantom (black), Fireball (red), SubZero (blue), Cashmere (pink), and Lilac (the other pink), with a seventh Apple Store-exclusive color (a different blue).\n"}
