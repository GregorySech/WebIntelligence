 StarCraft II is going free-to-play starting on November 14th, Blizzard announced during its annual BlizzCon conference.The new free version of the game will offer access to the Wings of Liberty single-player campaign, along with every co-op commander up through level five. Blizzard is also making the game’s online ranked competitive multiplayer available for free with access to units from all three StarCraft II releases — although players will have to unlock that mode first by achieving 10 “First Wins of the Day” in unranked games or against the computer, something Blizzard says it’s doing to “preserve the quality and integrity of the ranked experience.”StarCraft 2 is going Free to Play!Campaign: Wings of Liberty FreeCommanders: Free to lvl 5Ranked: Free Unlock https://t.co/GDwvQvib77 pic.twitter.com/X9Vx79nQjo— StarCraft (@StarCraft) November 3, 2017For players who already own Wings of Liberty, Blizzard will be offering the second expansion for StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm, for free instead.
