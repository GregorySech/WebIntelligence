{"title": "Microsoft\u2019s new Modern Keyboard has a hidden fingerprint reader", "content": " \nMicrosoft has quietly unveiled a new \u201cModern Keyboard\u201d with an integrated fingerprint reader. The Modern Keyboard is the successor to the Surface Keyboard, and looks identical. The only changes are a new fingerprint reader and the ability to use a cable for a wired connection instead of wireless. \nMicrosoft has integrated the fingerprint reader into the second Windows key on the right-hand side of the keyboard, and it can be used to log into Windows 10 or websites using Windows Hello. The new Modern Keyboard will work with Windows 10, MacOS, and the latest versions of Android. \nThe Modern keyboard will be available shortly, priced at $129.99. It's a surprisingly quick release schedule after Microsoft only debuted the Surface Keyboard for $99 recently. $129.99 is a lot to pay for a keyboard, but it is one of the best desktop keyboards on the market at the moment if you like laptop-like key travel. If you already bought the original Surface Keyboard then I feel your pain.\n"}
