{"title": "Thor gets a new \u2018do in the first teaser trailer for Thor: Ragnarok", "content": " \nThe first teaser trailer for Thor: Ragnarok has arrived. And between the extravagant costumes, wild makeup, and brilliantly colored \u201880s aesthetic, it\u2019s possible that this may be the weirdest Marvel movie to date. In a catalog that includes Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange, that\u2019s saying something.\nBring the thunder\nThor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, marks the third standalone Marvel movie featuring the Norse god of thunder. After the accidental release of the goddess of death Hela, (Cate Blanchett, in a rather impressive headdress that, in the words of my colleague Chris Plante, looks \u201clike she killed Satan and Bambi's parents and made the result into couture headwear), Thor is separated from both his hammer and his flowing golden locks and banished to the alien planet of Sakaar. On this alien planet, he is forced to fight as an intergalactic gladiator alongside the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The film also sees the return of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, and of course, fan-favorite Tom Hiddleston as the meddlesome trickster Loki. \nAccording to interviews with Waititi, Ragnarok will be more lighthearted than its dreary, faux-Shakespearian predecessors \u2014 even though Thor has a new and depressingly short haircut. Thor: Ragnarok hits theaters on November 3rd.\n\n"}
