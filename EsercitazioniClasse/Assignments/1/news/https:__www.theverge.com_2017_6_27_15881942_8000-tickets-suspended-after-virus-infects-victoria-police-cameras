{"title": "Australian police blame WannaCry for spoiling 8,000 traffic cam tickets", "content": " \nAustralian police have had to suspend upward of 8,000 tickets for speeding and running red lights after learning the cameras that caught the acts had become infected with a virus. The Victoria, Australia police blamed the WannaCry virus, which spread through Windows computers last month, locking down systems and demanding a ransom be paid before they could be used again.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear that WannaCry is the right diagnosis here \u2014 police said the virus spread over USB and caused the cameras to continually reboot, neither of which are features WannaCry is known for. But either way, a virus infected nearly 100 of the state\u2019s 280 road cameras, which was enough for police to doubt the integrity of all of them.\n\u201cAt no point could I be confident that this virus had not gone into any other of the 280 cameras.\u201d\nUntil the police are able to review the systems to ensure that the virus didn\u2019t alter the camera\u2019s findings, all tickets issued between June 6th and June 22nd \u2014 when the virus was first uploaded and when it was wiped out \u2014 are being withdrawn. Doug Fryer, the assistant commissioner, said the tickets may still be issued at a later date if no problems are detected.\n\u201cI need as the responsible enforcement officer to be absolutely sure that the 280 cameras were working correctly, with integrity, without any corruption,\u201d Fryer said at a news conference on Saturday.\nPolice said the virus was spread by a USB drive that a maintenance worker inserted into the cameras. Earlier last week, police said only 55 cameras had been infected and decided to withhold tickets from those cameras only. They later discovered an additional 42 cameras that were infected, leading them to expand the review and the freeze on ticketing.\n\u201cAt no point could I be confident that this virus had not gone into any other of the 280 cameras,\u201d said police minister Lisa Neville. She said the review was \u201cabsolutely critical for public confidence in our red light and speed cameras system.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s not perfectly clear that WannaCry was really behind this attack, it\u2019s still very possible that some sort of virus managed to infect the cameras. Researchers have been warning for years that systems like these are vulnerable to all kinds of simple and clever attacks, and it seems like Victoria\u2019s police have been unfortunate enough to find that out firsthand.\n"}
