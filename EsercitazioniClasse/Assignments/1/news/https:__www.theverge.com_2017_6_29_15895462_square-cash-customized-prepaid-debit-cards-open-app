The big difference is it serves as a way to use your Square Cash funds in stores, instead of having to transfer out funds to a regular debit card or hope that your retailer supports Apple Pay to use these types of virtual cards. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nHere\u2019s how to order Square\u2019s new prepaid card\n\nFor a better how-to of the process of creating a Square Cash Card, I\u2019ll direct you to my colleague Lauren Goode, who\u2019s already written extensively about ordering the custom-engraved cards along with more about Square\u2019s motivation for making it. (In short, it\u2019s to better compete with Venmo.)\nWhile Dorsey has said that anyone can sign up as of today, the feature appears to be rolling out slowly and doesn\u2019t seem to be live yet on either the website or app at the time of posting. If you really want one, be patient and keep refreshing.\n\n"}
