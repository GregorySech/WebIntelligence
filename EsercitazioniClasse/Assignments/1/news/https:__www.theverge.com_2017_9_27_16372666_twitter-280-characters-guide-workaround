{"title": "How to tweet with 280 characters right now", "content": " \nTwitter doubled the character limit of tweets to 280 in a surprise move yesterday, but not every Twitter user will be able to use the new limit just yet. Twitter is rolling out the long tweets feature to select accounts as a test, but Twitter user Prof9 has discovered a workaround to get longer tweets a little early. Here\u2019s how to tweet with 280 characters instead of 140:\n\nDownload Tampermonkey for your browser of choice (Chrome webstore link)\nVisit this Github repository, click the \u201craw\u201d button, then tell tampermonkey to \u201cinstall\u201d the script (or copy and paste the code into a new script in Tampermonkey)\nNow visit twitter.com, make sure the script in running in Tampermonkey, then tweet away\n\nIt\u2019s a simple workaround that will work automatically on Twitter.com every time you use the web client to tweet. Tampermonkey is a widely used userscript manager, and the javascript is a harmless workaround that simply bypasses the tweet button limit. \nTwitter is slowly testing its 280 character tweet limits with a variety of accounts, so if you don\u2019t want to install Tampermonkey then you might get randomly selected for the test in the coming weeks or months. \n\n\nHello world, this is a large Tweet. This tweet has 280 characters instead of the regular and boring 140, and it's going to change everything. One more thing: you can do this yourself with a userscript in Chrome, it's really simple to do :)\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) September 27, 2017\n\n\n\n"}
