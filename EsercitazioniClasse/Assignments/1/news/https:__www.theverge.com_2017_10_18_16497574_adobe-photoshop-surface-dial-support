{"title": "Adobe Photoshop now supports Microsoft\u2019s Surface Dial", "content": " \nMicrosoft originally unveiled its Surface Dial accessory for its Surface Studio all-in-one PC almost a year ago. App support has been fairly limited so far, but Microsoft did promise that Photoshop would start supporting the accessory. That support is finally arriving today, beyond the basic zoom options that have existed for the past year.\nAdobe is updating its popular software to Photoshop CC today, and it includes Surface Dial integration to tweak brush settings. I\u2019ve tested the Surface Dial integration, and it\u2019s limited to just the brush settings. Adobe\u2019s implementation brings up a separate brush menu when you trigger the Dial, and you can adjust size, opacity, hardness, flow, and smoothing by rotating the Dial. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther apps like Sketchable have shown that there\u2019s so much more you can do with the Surface Dial, so it\u2019s a little disappointing to see such basic support with Photoshop. Adobe\u2019s support does arrive just in time for the Surface Book 2 release next month, though. Microsoft\u2019s new laptop includes Surface Dial support on the screen (just like the Studio and Surface Pro) and the updated Surface Pen. \n"}
