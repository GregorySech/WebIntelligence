{"title": "Harman Kardon Invoke review: Cortana gets a speaker of its own", "content": " \nFor a company that makes a voice-controlled assistant, it has become table stakes to have a smart speaker for the home that uses it: Amazon\u2019s Alexa debuted on the Echo smart speaker three years ago, Google now has a complete lineup of Home speakers that use the Google Assistant, and Apple\u2019s forthcoming HomePod is powered by, you guessed it, Siri.\nNot one to be left out of the party, there\u2019s now a smart wireless speaker that uses Microsoft\u2019s Cortana assistant. The $199 Harman Kardon Invoke is not hugely different than the Amazon Echo or Google Home. It has seven far-field microphones to hear your voice commands from across the room. It has a circular light on top that illuminates when it hears its wake word or is responding to a request. And it can be used to deliver facts, perform unit conversions, set timers or alarms, look up directions, control smart home gadgets, or add things to a to-do or shopping list.\nThe Invoke can also be used to listen to music, and this is where it separates itself from devices from Amazon and Google. The Invoke has more powerful speakers than either of its competitors, and, as a perhaps obvious result, it sounds a lot better than the Echo or Home. Since Amazon itself admits that the thing people use the Echo for more than any other is to listen to music, the Invoke\u2019s improved audio experience is definitely appreciated.\nBut that experience comes at a cost, and the price difference between the Invoke and the others is not insignificant. Further, while Cortana is a capable virtual assistant, it\u2019s clear that this device is Microsoft\u2019s first effort in this space, and it has some catching up to do with Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of design, the Invoke is most similar to the first-generation Echo from 2015. It\u2019s a roughly four-inch diameter cylinder that\u2019s just under 10 inches tall, with a tapered design that gets narrower at the top. The finish is definitely a step up from Amazon\u2019s offering, with a more attractive speaker grille and a chrome bevel at the top that catches light nicely. It is available in black or white color options, both of which should look nice in a modern home d\u00e9cor.\nThe only physical controls on the Invoke are the volume ring at the top (which effectively works identically to the first-gen Echo\u2019s, but has smoother damping), a touch-sensitive pad on the top, and the mute and Bluetooth buttons on the back. The Invoke can be used as a standard Bluetooth speaker, but it cannot connect to a larger speaker either over Bluetooth or with an aux cable like the newer Echo devices can.\nNot that you\u2019d have much of a reason to hook the Invoke up to another speaker even if it could. Under the speaker grille are three 1.75-inch midrange drivers and three 0.5-inch tweeters, arranged in an outward-facing circle to provide 360 degrees of sound. The Invoke doesn\u2019t have a subwoofer, but there is a passive radiator to enhance the bass. All of this is pushed by a 40-watt amplifier, which Harman Kardon boasts is more powerful than any of its direct competitors.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn x-ray view of the Invoke\u2019s speaker array\nImage: Harman Kardon\n\n\n\nThis speaker array makes the Invoke much nicer to listen to than the Echo (even the new and supposedly improved model) and the Google Home. It fills a room with sound much better than either of those speakers, and though it won\u2019t be suitable for bumping a house party, it has actual bass response, which is all but non-existent in the others. The Invoke\u2019s only real competitor here is the equally priced Sonos One, which is louder still with even better bass.\nThe touch-sensitive pad at the top of the speaker will illuminate with a blue-and-white circle whenever the \u201cHey Cortana\u201d wake-up command is said. It will shine red when the speaker is muted, and it will display a white ring when you adjust the volume. It\u2019s easier to see across the room than the lights on the Google Home, but the Echo\u2019s brighter ring is better still.\nYou can tap the top of the Invoke to pause music that\u2019s playing or cancel a command. If you tap it when the Invoke isn\u2019t doing anything, Cortana will serve up a random fact.\nBut like the Echo and Google Home, the main way you\u2019re supposed to use the Invoke is through voice commands. It\u2019s very good at hearing my voice from across the room, even while music is playing, and it rarely failed when I barked a command at it. It only responds to \u201cHey Cortana,\u201d however, and you cannot change it to a different wake word. Saying \u201cHey Cortana\u201d every time is more tedious than the Echo\u2019s simpler \u201cAlexa\u201d command, especially if you\u2019re saying it multiple times in a row to perform different actions.\nAt launch, the Invoke works with Spotify, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio, with support for Pandora promised to come. I was able to pull up specific albums or playlists from my Spotify account, and even save new tracks to my library or follow a playlist with just a voice command. The Invoke wasn\u2019t able to find everything, however, and it tended to fall back to a generic artist playlist when it couldn\u2019t find the specific album I asked for. Other music services can be played via Bluetooth, but voice commands are limited to volume control and pause / resume / next / previous track control in Bluetooth mode.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a personal assistant, the Invoke is most useful if you already live in Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem. It can pull up calendar information from Outlook.com and Office 365 accounts, and it can add items to a to-do list in the Cortana app on a phone or Windows 10 computer. You can even ask the Invoke to remind you at a specific time or location and your other devices will light up when the task is due. But if you use other services for your calendar, Cortana can\u2019t access them at all, which meant it couldn\u2019t see any of the calendar appointments in my Google Calendar account. It also couldn\u2019t access or control my to-do list or shopping list in Todoist, which I\u2019m able to do with either the Echo or Google Home.\nFor smart home control, the Invoke works with SmartThings, Philips Hue, Nest, Wink, and Insteon out of the box, which covers a large number of smart home gadgets. I was able to voice control my lights with Hue or SmartThings using the Invoke, just like I can on the Echo or Google Home. Microsoft says it is working with Honeywell, Ecobee, TP-Link, Johnson Controls, IFTT, Geeni, Iris by Lowe\u2019s, and iDevices to add support for those products and services in Cortana.\nThe Invoke can also be used to place calls, using Microsoft\u2019s Skype service. The company says it\u2019s Skype certified for conference calling, but it my tests, callers were distant and they had trouble hearing me, so it wasn\u2019t a great experience. The Invoke cannot be used as a Bluetooth speakerphone for standard calls, which is probably for the best given my experience with the Skype calling feature.\nBeyond those music and productivity functions, the Invoke can be used to answer facts and trivia; provide weather forecasts, news updates, and traffic information; and provide some quick entertainment, such as telling jokes or poems. It\u2019s not unlike Alexa or the Google Assistant in this respect, and it didn\u2019t have any trouble performing unit conversions or telling me when the local Home Depot closes and how long it will take me to get there when I asked.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the fact that it works best with Microsoft\u2019s own services and doesn\u2019t support others, Cortana\u2019s biggest limitation is that it can only support one account at this time. Calendar information, reminders, and to-dos will all be pulled from the account the Invoke was set up with, which makes it difficult to use as a shared device for those functions. Both Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant have added features that attempt to identify the person making the voice request and serve up personalized information to them. And while the Invoke does sound good on its own, it can\u2019t be paired in stereo or be used in a multi-room system, like Google, Amazon, or Sonos speakers can.\nAnd then there\u2019s the cost: the Invoke is twice as expensive as Amazon\u2019s new Echo, $70 more than the Google Home, and the same price as the new Sonos One, which sounds better and has more flexibility with multi-room setups. If you just want a simple voice-controlled smart speaker, it\u2019s hard to argue with Amazon\u2019s Echo, and if you care deeply about sound quality, the Sonos One (which has Alexa built in) is probably a better option.\nBut if you do live in Microsoft\u2019s world and sound quality has some importance to you, there\u2019s a lot to like about the Invoke. It\u2019s further along than where Amazon or Google were at their debuts, and it already does a lot of things you want a smart speaker to do. Plus, it doesn\u2019t compromise on sound quality quite as much as the others.\nIf Microsoft is able to deliver those promised improvements and perhaps make Cortana work better with non-Microsoft services, the Invoke could be a compelling smart speaker for the rest of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nVerge Score\n\n\nHarman Kardon Invoke\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nGreat sound quality\nSharp design\nGood microphones for hearing voice commands\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nOnly works with Microsoft\u2019s calendars and productivity services\nTwice as expensive as an Echo\nDoesn\u2019t support multiple accounts or multi-room audio\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotography by Dan Seifert / The Verge\n\n"}
