{"title": "Sesame Street's new Muppet with autism is part of the show's bigger, empathic agenda", "content": " \nSince Sesame Street launched in 1969, it\u2019s been steadily expanding its educational agenda. The earliest episodes were simple, with a focus on helping young viewers get an early start on learning letters, numbers, shapes, and basic vocabulary words. Over the past four decades plus, the team behind the show has progressively gotten more ambitious about addressing social issues as well, preparing kids to interact with one another on the playground and in school. Sesame Street\u2019s latest initiative in that direction is a puppet character with autism: Julia, a 4-year-old girl first introduced in a Sesame Street picturebook, and now joining the cast of the show. Her inclusion on the television series is part of a program called See Amazing In All Children, which is aimed at helping parents and neurotypical kids understand different aspects of autistic behavior, interact with children on the spectrum, and accept other kids\u2019 differences in general.\nJulia is due to join the show on April 10, but she\u2019s already been launched online. In one early sketch, she makes and pops bubbles with series regular Abby Cadabby, a vocal, encouraging 3-year-old who praises Julia\u2019s problem-solving. In another video, Big Bird greets Julia and assumes she doesn\u2019t like him because she\u2019s too absorbed in coloring to interact with him. One of the show\u2019s adult characters has to explain the autistic spectrum to Big Bird so he understands Julia\u2019s reaction, and why she\u2019s less verbal or interactive than some of the Muppets he\u2019s used to. The skits are designed to help kids understand different ways autistic kids might approach play or socialization. \n\nSesame Street doesn\u2019t often introduce new characters \u2014 or eliminate old ones, though a few of them have drifted onto and off of the show, and the show made headlines in 2016 by letting go of three of its veteran human performers. Back in 2013, the show addressed the impact of incarceration on kids by introducing a new character whose father was in jail, and building skits around his feelings. In other countries where the show airs, the show has included characters relevant to local issues. Afghanistan got Zari, an ambitious young girl Muppet, to counteract prejudice against women getting educations. South Africa has Kami, an HIV-positive character. The Palestinian version of the show, now independently produced, has its own cast of characters designed to help kids navigate local tensions. Julia is just the latest in an expanding stable of characters designed to represent the broad range of the human experience, and how it trickles down to children.\nSesame Workshop, which produces Sesame Street, recently introduced the character via a video that explains the research that went into creating Julia. It was a complicated project, since autism manifests in a wide variety of ways in different people. But one particularly interesting note from the intro video: Julia\u2019s puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, has an autistic son herself, and sees this character as a chance to help the public understand him, and other children like him.  \n\n\n"}
