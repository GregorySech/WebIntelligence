{"title": "Congress just cleared the way for internet providers to sell your web browsing history", "content": " \nInternet providers now just need a signature from President Trump before they\u2019re free to take, share, and even sell your web browsing history without your permission.\nThe House of Representatives passed a resolution today overturning an Obama-era FCC rule that required internet providers to get customers\u2019 permission before sharing their browsing history with other companies. The rules also required internet providers to protect that data from hackers and inform customers of any breaches.\nThe resolution was first passed by the Senate last week and now heads to the president, who\u2019s expected to sign it. At that point, there\u2019ll only be a vague baseline of privacy rules governing internet providers and some promises from them not to misbehave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a tip for us?

While reversing the FCC\u2019s privacy rules will technically just maintain the status quo \u2014 internet providers have actually been able to sell your web browsing data forever (it\u2019s just not a thing we think about all that much) \u2014 they were about to lose permission to keep doing it, unless they got explicit consent or anonymized the info.\nThis is an increasingly important issue as Americans spend more and more time online \u2014 and keep more and more devices with them at all times. Internet providers can see what sites you visit and what apps you use, and they can see how long you\u2019re using them for. That information is extremely revealing, and it\u2019s easy to imagine most people would prefer to keep their reading habits private.\n\u201cThe consequences of passing this resolution are clear: broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission,\u201d said Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA) on the House floor this afternoon. \u201cAnd no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about.\u201d\nSo why did Congress block the rules from being implemented? Republicans bought into internet providers\u2019 arguments that the rules discriminated against them and could confuse consumers. The rules would prevent internet providers from selling your web browsing history even though, the argument goes, websites like Google and Facebook would remain free to do the same thing. ISPs say that\u2019s unfair and makes it hard for consumers to understand who gets to see their browsing data.\nInternet providers want to pretend they\u2019re just like Google and Facebook\nBut the argument is extremely misleading, if not outright wrong: Google and Facebook can\u2019t see your web browsing history, they can only see what you click on while you\u2019re on their own websites or on websites connected to their ad networks. Meanwhile, internet providers get to see a bit of nearly everything you do and visit; and even with the rules in place, they have every right to build the kind of ad-tracking websites that Google and Facebook have built. It\u2019s just hard work, and they don\u2019t want to do it.\nThe rules, if anything, put internet providers on a level playing field with companies like Facebook and Google. But Republicans don\u2019t like that it creates more work for them. \u201cThese rules do little to enhance privacy but clearly add a layer of red tape on innovators and job creators,\u201d Representative Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House\u2019s commerce committee, said ahead of the vote. The rules, he said, \u201chave the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our economy.\u201d\nThis was a common line of argument from Republican representatives, who continually conflated internet providers with companies that build businesses connected to the internet. They frequently took issue with creating a distinction between these two types of companies, despite the fact the huge distinction exists: ISPs like Comcast essentially create digital roads, while companies like Google create hugely innovative businesses along those roads. There\u2019s good reason to treat the two differently.\nRepublicans say the privacy rules are too confusing\nRepublicans and internet providers also complained that the FCC\u2019s rules didn\u2019t perfectly align with the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s privacy framework, which governed internet providers up until the 2015 net neutrality order went into effect. In reality, the differences are slight \u2014 the real argument here is just over ISP\u2019s ability to share your browsing history.\nRepresentative Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), chair of the House subcommittee on communications and technology, actually claimed that removing the rules would improve privacy by closing that distinction. \u201cConsumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create,\u201d she said.\nThe vote was surprisingly close, coming in at 215 in favor of the resolution and 205 against; 15 Republicans even voted in opposition.\nWith these rules all-but killed, the FCC will now be left without any firm regulations for internet providers on the books. The commission may now go about proposing and passing a weaker set of restrictions that better match up with what the FTC has on the books.\nThis is a huge loss for consumer privacy\nIn a statement following the vote, FCC chairman Ajit Pai indicated his approval of Congress\u2019 action, saying the rules \u2014 which he voted against last year \u2014 represented commission \u201coverreach\u201d and were \u201cdesigned to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies.\u201d\nPai reiterated his intention to realign the FCC\u2019s rules with the FTC\u2019s weaker privacy framework. But how that\u2019ll happen is unclear. Pai says the FCC will work with the FTC, but he also says he\u2019d prefer to just kill the 2015 net neutrality order so that the FCC doesn\u2019t have a say over privacy at all.\nIn an added blow to privacy advocates, the FCC won\u2019t be able to pass privacy restrictions protecting all web browsing history again, since the resolution prevents it. Though the commission will, it seems, still be able to block internet providers from sharing info related to children, banking, or medical history, which the FTC considered sensitive in the first place.\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.\n"}
