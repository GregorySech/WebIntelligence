{"title": "ZTE is launching two budget phones with Android N", "content": " \nNearly two months after ZTE announced that the Blade V8 Pro would be coming to the US, the company is adding two new devices to the line: the Blade V8 Lite and Blade V8 Mini. Both phones will only be initially available in the Asia Pacific and Europe, including Russia, Japan, and Germany. Let\u2019s check out the specs:\nBlade V8 Mini:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE\n\n\n\nSnapdragon 435 processor\nAndroid N\n13-megapixel / 2-megapixel dual rear camera system\nRear fingerprint sensor\n5-inch HD screen\n2GB RAM with 16GB storage\n2,800 mAh battery\nMicro USB; headphone jack\n\nBlade V8 Lite:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZTE\n\n\n\nMediaTek 6750 processor\nAndroid N\n8-megapixel rear-facing camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera\nRear fingerprint sensor\n5-inch Full HD screen\n2GB RAM with 16GB storage\n2,500mAh battery\nMicro USB; headphone jack\n\nThe Mini\u2019s super cute! That red color (pictured above) reminds me slightly of the spunky iPhone 5C colors. The Mini also features a similar dual camera system to the V8 Pro, but at a cheaper price, which is cool. But really what\u2019s commendable here is that ZTE is launching these devices with Android N. Good job, ZTE.\n"}
