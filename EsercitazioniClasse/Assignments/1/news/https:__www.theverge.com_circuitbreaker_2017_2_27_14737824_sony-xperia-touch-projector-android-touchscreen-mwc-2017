Now, though, one of them is actually going on sale: the newly christened Xperia Touch \u2014 an Android projector that turns any surface into a touchscreen. \nUnveiled at MWC today, the Xperia Touch is meant to be more than just a projector, with Sony hoping it will act as a digital hub for families. The company has created its own user interface for the Touch, which puts a bunch of information in one place, including calendar events, real-time weather data, and a \u201cmemo board\u201d anyone can doodle on. You can also access Skype video chat from this screen, or leave video notes (like \u201cremember the milk!\u201d or \u201cI love you don\u2019t die today!\u201d) for other members of your family. You can check out a video of the prototype version of the Touch, then named the Xperia Projector, from CES below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Sony\n\n\nAs well as this digital pinboard functionality, the Touch can do anything you\u2019d expect an Android tablet to. You can browse the web, watch videos or slideshows, and download apps and games from the Google Play Store. It also works with the PS4\u2019s Remote Play feature, meaning you can use it to game over the internet if someone else is using the TV attached to your console. \nThe Touch uses Sony\u2019s SXRD projection display technology and detects users\u2019 gestures and taps using a combination of infrared sensors and a regular 60 fps camera. It\u2019s going on sale in Europe sometime this spring and has a suggested retail price of \u20ac1,499 ($1,583). \n"}
