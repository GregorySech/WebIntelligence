{"title": "Chrome for iOS gets an offline Read Later feature", "content": " \nGoogle has officially brought a Pocket-like Read Later feature to the latest version of Chrome for iOS, as rumored by 9to5Mac last week. The feature works a lot like Apple\u2019s Reading List feature in Safari \u2014 there\u2019s a new \u201cRead Later\u201d icon that appears on the share sheet in Chrome, which saves articles locally on the device to read later, even without an internet connection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles saved to the Reading List are accessible through the menu on Chrome the same way one would navigate to Bookmarks or History. Unlike Apple\u2019s Reading List or Pocket, however, locally saved articles are only saved to the specific device (Chrome for Mac doesn\u2019t actually support the new Reading List at all). Additionally, unlike Apple\u2019s own Reading List or Pocket, Google\u2019s implementation saves the entire page, instead of a stripped-down text version. Still, it\u2019s a nice addition to the app, that helps Google maintain feature parity with Apple\u2019s own Safari browser on iOS. \nGoogle previously added a similar feature to Chrome for Android back in December, although it\u2019s implemented a bit differently than the iOS version. The Android version allows users to download pages through an arrow icon in the menu, but treats saved pages like any other downloaded file, compared to the iOS version which more explicitly marks things as \u201cread it later.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
