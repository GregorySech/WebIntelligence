{"title": "Cardi B beat out the biggest pop star in the world to nab her first No. 1 hit", "content": " \nCardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d is officially the No. 1 song in the country, beating out Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d on the Billboard Hot 100 this week. This makes her the first solo female rapper to top the chart since Lauryn Hill in 1998 and only the fifth female rapper to ever have a No. 1 hit. \nLuis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\u2019s \u201cDespacito\u201d had been sitting at the top of the charts for 16 weeks when the lead single for Swift\u2019s Reputation (her first new album since October 2014) hit the web on August 24th, debuting at No. 1. Dethroned after three weeks, the song is a minor failure for Swift, who sat at the top of the charts for four weeks with \u201cShake it Off,\u201d and seven with \u201cBlank Space\u201d during her last album rollout. \nThe battle for the spot was one of the most well-attended Twitter sporting events of the last month. Anyone with an investment in a true come-up story was tweeting to stream \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d while Swift fans insisted on \u201cLWYMMD streaming parties\u201d to keep her single on top. Die-hard Nicki Minaj fans joined them, eager to deprive Cardi of an achievement the \u201ctrue\u201d queen of rap hadn\u2019t secured yet. They tweeted \u201c#StreamLWYMMD,\u201d too, making an unlikely alliance where there was once a lot of uh, sorry, bad blood. \n\n\nask urself: what am i personally doing to get bardi to no 1 this week\u2014 Naomi Zeichner (@nomizeichner) September 15, 2017\n\n\n\nBut hashtag battles between fans dedicated to one artist or another are nothing new, and we have no way to prove what impact they might have (likely not much). What\u2019s behind Cardi B\u2019s unlikely win? Algorithm or alchemy? Probably a little bit of both, and I won\u2019t be the first or last to suggest that people are just plain tired of Taylor Swift, a style of pop princess who feels almost anachronistic just three years after her nearly unprecedented crossover from CMT and Joni Mitchell bangs. But just three months after her showy return to the platform, Swift\u2019s Spotify page boasts nearly 37 million monthly listeners, making her the second most popular artist (behind only Ed Sheeran) and a monthly habit for more than a quarter of Spotify\u2019s active users. \nCardi B is the 97th most popular artist on the platform, with just over 13 million unique monthly listeners. Regardless, Cardi beats Taylor on Spotify\u2019s charts, too. She\u2019s at No. 4 there, with about 1.1 million streams per day for \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d Swift\u2019s down at No. 12, with about 740,000 streams per day for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d Cardi B has far more loyal, repeat streamers, where a significant number of Taylor\u2019s appear to have been sucked in briefly by her gravitational pull in the popular culture. They weren\u2019t bumping this song over and over, they were streaming it once, maybe twice, to acquaint themselves with the news of the day. \n\n\nYou should be listening to Bodak Yellow right now.\u2014 VICELAND (@VICELAND) September 22, 2017\n\n\n\nLast Thursday, Swift discounted her single from $1.29 to $0.69 in the iTunes store, seen by many onlookers as a petty, transparent attempt to cling to her spot and hold off a newcomer for whom it would mean so much more. Meanwhile, Cardi was only coming off as charming, tweeting at a Swift fan, \u201cI love me some Taylor Swift my freaking self,\u201d and posting a clip of herself singing along to \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d to her Instagram Story. But whether or not the iTunes markdown was a silent, strategic move to hold onto the No. 1 spot, it would have been a futile one for Swift. Her single was already way ahead in digital sales and it was streams she needed. (Radio play seems like a negligible factor, as that chart looks nothing at all like the Hot 100.) \nThat, Spin\u2019s Jordan Sargent argued, is where Friday\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d behind-the-scenes music video came in: \n\u201cOne way for Swift to hold Cardi B off would be to increase the number of streams for \u2018Look What You Made Me Do.\u2019 One way of doing that would be to drive eyeballs to a new video that starts playing the full version of \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 immediately after the conclusion of the actual advertised content so long as the viewer doesn\u2019t close the tab in a split-second with reflexes that could murder Jason Bourne.\u201d\nFor someone so obsessed with curating her image and discussing her \u201creputation,\u201d Swift sure has a habit of doing things that look bad. \n\n\nCardi B singing Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\"  pic.twitter.com/Ik9Raow7yr\u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) September 25, 2017\n\n\n\nWhen \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d hit the top of the rap charts, less than three months after its release, Billboard called it \u201cthe quickest ascent to number 1 by a lead artist\u2019s debut chart entry since Psy\u2019s \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 shot to the summit in its second frame in 2012.\u201d Swift\u2019s single was released the same day, and Cardi B addressed the timing in an interview on The Breakfast Club, joking, \u201cI almost had it, but then that damn Taylor Swift came out of nowhere like a Hurricane Irma or something.\u201d A new Swift single might come in like a hurricane, but as Cardi would tell you herself, she\u2019s been making money moves all summer. It was only a matter of time. \na social media star vs. the most traditional success story in music \nCardi B is a Cinderella story for the age of social media. Or as Lindsay Zoladz argued on The Ringer last week, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be quite right. The Cinderella myth relies on some sort of ruse, a shamed secrecy about the truth of a woman\u2019s past, and the outside agency of both a fairy godmother and a prince. Cardi B trimmed all that extra stuff from the story. She restructured the fairy tale into a one-woman show.\u201d She started out as a stripper. She managed to accumulate 9 million followers over years of experimentation on Instagram and Vine. She translated that following into a spot on Love & Hip-Hop: New York, then realized she could rap. \n\u201cVine and Instagram and Twitter taught her concision and what resonates with an audience,\u201d Zoladz pointed out. \u201cWhat is a viral phrase if not a spoken-word hook? Why wait for someone else to sample an idea as funny as \u2018a hoe never gets cold\u2019? Why not just turn it into a song yourself?\u201d In the last year, Cardi has put out two mixtapes, Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, and now she has her first No. 1 song (a whim of a freestyle that didn\u2019t appear on either tape). She\u2019s managed to milk social media stardom for all its worth, which, as it turns out, is a lot. \nSo here, take a few minutes and celebrate: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
