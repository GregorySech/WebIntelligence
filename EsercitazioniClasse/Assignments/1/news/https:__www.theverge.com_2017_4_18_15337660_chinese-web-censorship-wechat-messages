{"title": "China\u2019s internet censors allow one-on-one complaining, but won\u2019t let you gripe in group chat", "content": " \nEveryone knows that China has some of the most sophisticated censorship tools in the world, but the details of how they actually work \u2014 what they censor and when \u2014 are often not fully understood. A new report by Citizen Lab, a research group studying the web, human rights, and global security, sheds some light on one particularly fruitful target for Chinese censorship: mobile messaging.\nCitizen Lab looked at how the Chinese government censors discussion on WeChat, a popular messaging app. WeChat is the fourth biggest messaging service in the world, with more than 768 million active users, but is also deeply embedded in Chinese society, where it\u2019s used not only for chatting, but for tasks like banking, paying bills, booking holidays, calling cabs, and much more.  \nThe cornerstone of WeChat censorship is keyword filtering, which blocks messages that contain terms like \u201chuman rights,\u201d \u201cmass arrest,\u201d and \u201cspiritual freedom.\u201d However, Citizen Lab found that the censors don\u2019t just block messages containing any one specific phrase, but instead look for combinations of different terms. So you can send a message with the words \u201chuman rights lawyer\u201d in it, but if you combine that with the name of a specific lawyer \u2014 Jiang Tianyong, who was recently \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the government \u2014 the message is blocked. \nWhen a message is censored, users are not notified of this fact. They see it as sent in their own app, but it just never reaches its intended recipient. The system works by examining every message that is sent when it passes through WeChat\u2019s servers. The list of filtered keywords is also reactive, and changes in relation to the news; and only to WeChat accounts using mobile phone numbers registered in the Chinese mainland. Citizen Lab says much of the censorship on WeChat is currently focused around the \u201c709 Crackdown\u201d \u2014 a series of arrests against civil dissenters that began on the 9th of July 2015 (hence the name). \nAn interesting quirk of WeChat censorship discovered by Citizen Lab is that it\u2019s stricter when it comes to group discussions. The group found that more keyword combinations were blocked in chats containing multiple users than in one-on-one conversations. The reason for this isn\u2019t clear, but it could be the Chinese government thinks it prudent to allow limited discussion of sensitive topics, but that group conversations are more dangerous, perhaps leading to organized dissent. WeChat Moments (a feature similar to Facebook\u2019s News Feed) was also more heavily censored, with certain images filtered out as well. \nThe report notes: \u201cThe greater attention to group chat and Moments in particular may be due to the semi-public nature of the two features. Messages can reach and inspire discussions among wider audiences, making it subject to a higher level of scrutiny.\u201d\nFor a full list of censored keywords and combinations, you can read Citizen Lab\u2019s report in full here. \n"}
