{"title": "Fujifilm Instax Square SQ10 review: digital downer", "content": " \nDo you want to keep your photos for a long time, and make some of them widely available? Or do you want them to be more ephemeral, something you can give to a friend and maybe never see again? \nConsciously or not, we ask these questions a lot when trying to decide whether to use Snapchat or Instagram. But they're also swirling at the core of the new Fujifilm Instax Square SQ10.  \nIn many ways, the $279 SQ10 is just like the Instax cameras that came before it. It captures and prints instant photos. It\u2019s fun to use, and people love to interact with it. It still looks a bit like a toy, but it\u2019s also the most polished Instax camera Fujifilm has ever made. \nThere are two big differences, though. One is that the SQ10 shoots on a new square format of Instax film. The other is that it\u2019s now simultaneously a digital camera, too. These changes are supposed to help Fujifilm \u2014 which stands nearly alone in the instant film category \u2014 keep selling Instax cameras in the age of Instagram. But, if anything, the company might not have taken that second idea far enough.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: the new square instant film sits right in between Fujifilm\u2019s other two options. It\u2019s a little bit bigger than the Instax Mini, but not quite as big as the Instax Wide. Goldilocks would be proud. \nI\u2019ve always liked the cinematic look of Instax Wide, but Instax Square feels more familiar. It\u2019s, perhaps obviously, reminiscent of its ancestor \u2014 Polaroid\u2019s instant film. And, despite recently granting some wiggle room by finally allowing landscape and portrait uploads, Instagram is still all about squares, so Fujifilm is trying to cash in on a similar look. (Instax Square film is also Fujifilm\u2019s most expensive format at $17 per pack.)\nFujifilm is trying to cash in by echoing Instagram \nThe SQ10 has a hard time nailing the exposure if you\u2019re in a situation with extremely varied lighting, like in harsh, low sunlight with heavy shadows. Otherwise, the film is as good as it\u2019s always been. It favors rich colors and lots of contrast over fidelity, which has always been the case with instant (and especially Instax) film. It doesn\u2019t perform well in low light alone, but the camera\u2019s flash is more than capable. It\u2019s powerful, but it doesn\u2019t overpower the scene, and it helped me catch some of my favorite photos with the camera. Coming from someone who typically never uses flash, it was a nice surprise.\nThe SQ10\u2019s blockbuster feature, though, is that it\u2019s also a digital camera, but don\u2019t expect it to compete with the photography experience of a DSLR, or even your smartphone. It uses a 3.7-megapixel CMOS sensor, which is puny by today\u2019s standards. And while the images it captures look good enough printed on a piece of instant film, the digital copies are low-resolution, flat, and often uninspiring. With a little work, they might look fine on Instagram \u2014 just know that you\u2019ll have some trouble getting them there. (More on that in a minute.)\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are essentially two ways to shoot with the SQ10, which you pick by way of a toggle switch on the camera\u2019s left side. \u201cAuto\u201d mode means the camera will operate just like all the other Instax \u2014 a print will pop out every time you click the shutter.\n\u201cManual\u201d mode is where the camera deviates from the typical Instax experience. It doesn\u2019t mean manual focus, or manual exposure. Rather, the SQ10\u2019s manual mode means you\u2019re only shooting digital images. You can stuff about 50 photos into the small amount of onboard storage, or you can insert a microSD card. (The 32GB card I was using had room for well over 20,000 photos, thanks to the tiny 800\u2013900KB files that the camera creates.)  \nThe behavior of shooting in manual mode is totally new, and there are good and bad sides to it. What\u2019s wonderful, if you\u2019re a control freak like me, is that you now have final say on what the printed photo looks like \u2014 not just because you can take a shot over and over to get it right, but also because the camera has 10 creative filters plus an exposure and a vignette tool. You can return to any saved photo and re-edit it to your heart\u2019s desire, which is a nice change of pace for Instax.\nFor a camera that\u2019s all about the Instagram generation, it\u2019s awfully disconnected from Instagram\nThe most dumbfounding thing about the SQ10 is that it has no wireless radios. Because of this, you can\u2019t print photos from your phone like with Fujifilm\u2019s Instax Share printer, and it also means it\u2019s a chore to get the camera\u2019s digital files onto your phone. In order to do that, you have to take the microSD card out, stick it in an adapter, plug that into your computer, and then transfer them to your phone. For a camera that\u2019s supposedly all about the Instagram generation, it\u2019s awfully disconnected from Instagram. \nNow, do I need digital photos from a camera like this? Definitely not, considering I have a smartphone and a plethora of other digital cameras. One bright side to the SQ10 is that you aren\u2019t wasting moments worrying about which photos to post to Instagram that would otherwise be spent shooting with the camera. And considering people tend to use Instax cameras at parties or when hanging out with friends, that\u2019s probably a good thing. We definitely don\u2019t need another distracting connected device in those situations.\nBut I also don\u2019t need another graveyard for my images. If the camera is going to save these photos, I\u2019d like to do something with them at some point, and I\u2019d like that process to be easier than it is now.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a more elemental problem with the SQ10\u2019s digital DNA, though. Once people know it\u2019s digital, they react much differently than they do to other Instax cameras. They become more focused on fixing their appearance, and they want to approve the photo before you print it or make sure you delete it. \nWhen you shoot with other Instax cameras, people are typically aware that their attention is precious. It\u2019s like they inherently understand that they\u2019d be half-assing their way through posing for a photo with real costs associated with it. Shooting digital-first with the SQ10, I found they tended to treat the process more like the pose / shoot / review / repeat way of casually photographing each other that has become the norm with smartphones. In this sense, Fujifilm really did make a camera that caters to the Instagram generation \u2014 just not in a good way.\nThe SQ10 has problems, but it delights just like every other Instax\nDespite all this, the SQ10 can still delight. It generates the same joy that typically comes with shooting instant photos. People get genuinely excited every time the camera prints a picture. They all want to be the one who gets to keep the photo, too. The difference with the SQ10 is that it\u2019s the first instant camera that can accommodate that desire. \nIt's also now easier than ever to try out creative shooting modes like double exposure or long shutter. Modes like these demand trial and error, and that typically means spending more money and film. But the SQ10 lets you try and try until you\u2019re happy enough to print. The camera accommodates all this repeated shooting, too. I found the battery can get through days of shooting, editing, and printing before it needs to be recharged.  \nBecause the camera\u2019s digital files are so low-resolution, and so hard to access, these wind up being the real benefits of its hybrid nature. And since the digital side of the SQ10 is pretty low-tech, the performance is brisk. It\u2019s not as fast as shooting and reviewing with a smartphone, but it boots up in about two seconds, the autofocus is fast (even in somewhat challenging light), and it shoots quickly, too. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI always thought adding digital components to an Instax camera would make me want to buy one. But Fujifilm didn\u2019t take the idea far enough with the SQ10. It\u2019s basically a bad digital camera with a less capable Instax Share printer attached. Sure, it offers a means for capturing relatively low-resolution backups of your instant photos. Digital functionality also means the SQ10 is the first Instax camera you can constantly use without going broke. That\u2019s a step in the right direction. But the digital photos just aren\u2019t as valuable if there\u2019s no easy way for the user to do something with them. \nFujifilm got a lot right with the SQ10. The design is sharp, and I love the way it feels to grip and shoot. The interface is quick and fun, and the printed photos look just as good as ever. Those are largely the same things that already made Fujifilm\u2019s analog Instax cameras great, though.\nUntil the company makes a connected version of this camera, the SQ10\u2019s only real advantages are the ability to edit pictures and make multiple prints of the same photo. The idea of a digital / film hybrid camera is a fun one full of possibilities. But the camera won\u2019t be able to bear those out as long as the execution is half-baked. Maybe future Instax cameras will be more connected or more powerful. For now, though, it\u2019s still very much about the printed picture. \n\n\n\n\n\n6\nVerge Score\n\n\nFujifilm Instax Square SQ10\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nSolid build\nFun to shoot with\nPrinting photos is a delight\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nNo connectivity \nMost expensive Instax film yet\nDigital image quality is rough \n\n\n\n\nBuy for $279.00 from Amazon\n\n\n\n\n"}
