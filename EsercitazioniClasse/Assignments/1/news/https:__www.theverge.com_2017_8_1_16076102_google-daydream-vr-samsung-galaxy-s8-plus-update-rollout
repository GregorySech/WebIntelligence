{"title": "Google Daydream VR is rolling out to Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus owners now", "content": " \nGoogle\u2019s Daydream virtual reality platform is now rolling out on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, fulfilling a promise Google made earlier this year. Google announced the news last night, although it said on Twitter that it would take time to reach all S8 and S8 Plus owners. The expansion is a major boost for the Daydream platform, which first launched last year for the Google Pixel.\nGalaxy S8 and S8 Plus users could already use VR apps with Samsung and Oculus\u2019 $129 Gear VR, but now they can also try out Google\u2019s $79 Daydream View, which supports its own set of apps. The two options offer a  fundamentally similar mobile experience, but both have some exclusive apps and games, and their hardware looks and feels very different. Earlier this year, we concluded that the Gear VR\u2019s app ecosystem still made it a better choice than Daydream \u2014 but this update will give developers a bigger incentive to build for Google\u2019s platform.\nUntil now, Daydream was accessible on the HTC-built Google Pixel, as well as phones from Huawei, Asus, ZTE, and Lenovo. But none of these manufacturers have the reach of Samsung, which meant that comparatively few people could access Daydream. Google has promised a total of 11 phones with Daydream support by the end of the year, including a flagship device from LG.\n"}
