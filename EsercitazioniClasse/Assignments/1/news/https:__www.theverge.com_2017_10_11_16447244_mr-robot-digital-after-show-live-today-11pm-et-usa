{"title": "Mr. Robot Season 3, Episode 1: watch our digital after show", "content": " \nMr. Robot returns tonight on USA for season 3, along with your favorite digital aftershow to discuss all the latest twists and turns. Join Nilay Patel, Russell Brandom, and Megan Farokhmanesh (hey, that\u2019s me!) as we unpack the show, talk about our favorite hacks, and see what the fans are up to. Watch after the episode wraps up at 11PM.\nOh yeah, and here\u2019s the part where I note that USA Network is owned by NBCUniversal, which owns a minority stake in Vox Media, aka the parent company of The Verge. Like everything else that comes from The Verge editorial staff, the Mr. Robot Digital After Show is an independent editorial product, guided only by our interests and taste.\nCatch us on The Verge every week, or on the Mr. Robot Facebook page. Don\u2019t forget to join our weekly Reddit discussion thread to leave your thoughts and questions. You can also tweet us using #RobotAfterShow on Twitter! See you tonight. \nThis post has been updated to include video.\n"}
