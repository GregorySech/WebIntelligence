{"title": "The Moar is the electric bike Michael Bay would design", "content": " \nThe Moar is a new bike launching through an Indiegogo campaign from first-time company Moar Bikes. It\u2019s an electric bicycle, albeit one with an angled frame and fat, 24-inch tires that bring to mind an underpowered motorcycle more than a traditional pedal bike.\nInstead of focusing on cramming in smart features, the Moar is built to just be a powerful electric bicycle. So that means no built-in fitness tracking or a companion app. Instead, you\u2019ll get a full suspension system, disc brakes, and integrated turn signal tail lights. Moar says the bike\u2019s range will be anywhere from 30 miles all the way up to 85 miles \u2014 depending on what size battery you have and how hard you\u2019re pushing the motor \u2014 and a top speed of 20 mph. \nThe Moar also has an interesting folding mechanism, ostensibly for easy storage and transport, but when combined with the big, circular headlights on the front make it it look like an early draft of a robot from Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers movies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoar Bikes is actually selling three models of the Moar: the budget \u201cSun & Fun\u201d model for $999, a more advanced $1,199 \u201c24/7\u201d version that adds headlights, a larger battery, and better braking sensors, and the top-of-the-line $1,999 \u201cRapt\u201d which has a more powerful 750W motor, the largest battery (for a claimed 50- to 80-mile range), and hydraulic-assisted disk brakes. \nOf course, this is where the caveats come in. Shipping isn\u2019t included in those previously mentioned costs, and it\u2019s important to remember that Moar Bikes is a new, untested company that has yet to actually ship a product. And a $1,000 bike is a far bigger risk to take on crowdfunding than a $30 iPhone case. \nThat said, if the Moar does live up to its promises, it\u2019ll be a new and interesting form factor in the world of electric bikes. There are other folding electric bikes, but the Moar is the only one with huge off-road-ready tires and a compact righthand fold. If that\u2019s up your alley, you can back it on Indiegogo now, with delivery of the bikes estimated in May.  \n"}
