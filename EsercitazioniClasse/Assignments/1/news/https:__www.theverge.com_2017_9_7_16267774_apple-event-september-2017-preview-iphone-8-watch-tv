{"title": "Apple iPhone 8 event: what to expect", "content": " \nApple\u2019s upcoming September 12th event is more than just its annual hardware event: it marks 10 years of iPhone launches, which first shipped in June 2007 and is undeniably Apple\u2019s most important product. So, it\u2019s not surprising that many of the early reports and rumors about this event have been focused on the iPhone. Will it have an OLED display? Will there will be a \u201cpro\u201d version of the phone? And just how much will it cost? \nBut over the past decade, there have been just as many other notable product developments for Apple, on its path to becoming the world\u2019s most valuable tech company. It created the App Store, and the app economy. It shipped the long-rumored iPad. It got into wearable computing and health and fitness tracking with the launch of the Apple Watch. Its \u201cservices\u201d business became one of the fastest-growing areas for the company. \nSo this event could very well be about other products and services as much as it\u2019s about a new iPhone. Here\u2019s a rundown of what to expect from the event.\nNew iPhones\nOkay, with all of that said: this event is really about new iPhones. \nWe are expecting as many as three different iPhones. First and most obviously, there should be updates to both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The cadence between a new, numbered iPhone and an \"S\" update is something Apple has been doing since the iPhone 3GS. All rumors point to that happening again this year. S models usually include faster processors and better cameras, so that's probably a safe bet, too.\nWe\u2019re expecting as many as three different iPhone models\nAs for naming, we still don\u2019t know whether Apple will continue its tradition of affixing an \u201cS\u201d to an existing model number, or if it will be called iPhone 8. Our best guess is on some sort of \u201cS\u201d model, because there\u2019s another new iPhone that everybody\u2019s expecting, and this one could be called the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone Pro. Update: As of Saturday, September 9th, it appeared more likely that the anniversary edition phone would be called iPhone X, after an iOS developer spotted references to an \u201ciPhone X\u201d with a \u201cbezel-less display\u201d in a firmware leak. \nIt\u2019s widely expected that the iPhone X will be some advanced version of the iPhone, one that could possibly ship later this year. Rumors and leaks point to an edge-to-edge OLED display, a new 3D face-scanning camera, wireless charging capabilities, and a nonexistent home button. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\nMany of the new iPhone headline features are new for Apple, but not new in the broader industry. Other high-end smartphones have bright, edge-to-edge OLED displays, are using biometric sensors like iris scanners, or have done away with a physical home button, opting instead for fingerprint sensors on the backs of phones. And inductive charging isn\u2019t even entirely new for Apple, since the Apple Watch charges this way. \nWhat would set Apple\u2019s phone apart is the way it integrates this new design with software features, or gesture or voice controls, since Apple\u2019s distinct advantage is having control of the full stack in its products. We've also not yet seen a consumer phone with a face-unlock solution that wasn't insecure or slow (they're usually both). So if Apple has figured that out, it will be a genuinely new thing that it can claim to take the lead on. \nApple Watch 3/LTE\nThe wearables business isn\u2019t nearly as important for Apple right now as its phone business, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from making vague claims about the Apple Watch being comparable to the size of a Fortune 500 company all on its own. And, according to recent data from IDC, Apple is now only second to Xiaomi in terms of worldwide wearable shipments. So it\u2019s still a noteworthy product area for Apple. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising that we may see another update to the Apple Watch, one that adds an LTE modem to the device. This means that certain features that currently require having your phone nearby \u2014 like making phone calls, sending text messages, streaming music, or even installing new software \u2014 could work on the Watch independently of the phone. Other smartwatch makers have tried this before, including LG and Samsung. But one thing that often suffers when you try to make a tiny smartwatch act like your phone, and not an accessory to your phone, is battery life. So it\u2019s still TBD what LTE would do to Apple Watch\u2019s 18-hour battery life. \nApple\u2019s new Watch software, watchOS 4, is also expected to roll out in the coming weeks. This will bring new features like a Siri-ready watchface, a tri-sport (or multisport) mode, and some direct integration with gym equipment. \nApple TV\nThis may be the year that Apple finally catches up with Amazon, Roku, and Chromecast by offering 4K support on its streaming media device. The next generation of the Apple TV, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this year, will stream videos in 4K and in more \u201cvivid colors.\u201d (We're hoping for both HDR10 and Dolby Vision.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a move that will likely help boost sales of the box, which were down in the 2016 holiday season from the previous year, because it\u2019s a shiny new thing. But Apple TV has still been more expensive than many of its competitors, and it has an \u201capp\u201d-like interface rather than one that models a more traditional TV \u201cchannel\u201d experience. \nApple, unlike Amazon, has also struggled to make compelling original content that hooks people into its services the way it undoubtedly hoped it would. But if WWDC was any indication, Apple is also fully aware of that: the company said at the developers conference that the Amazon Prime Video app would come to Apple TV sometime this year. \nHomePod, iMac Pro, and Mac Pro\nAll three are products that Apple has announced, but has yet to ship. So whether they'll get stage time is anybody's guess. The HomePod's planned release date is December, and Apple has, so far, marketed it more as a high-quality speaker than a digital assistant. Apple will surely remind us that it's coming, but probably won't do much more with it.\nThe iMac Pro is also slated for a December release, but there probably won't be time to touch on it during this month's event. As for the fully redesigned Mac Pro, that won't arrive until next year, and it's hard to imagine that Apple will unveil it now. Sorry, Mac fans. You'll have to wait a little longer.\niOS 11, ARKit, and macOS High Sierra\nNew hardware is great, but Apple\u2019s software rollouts are a lot more critical for people who aren\u2019t planning on buying new Macs or iPhones in 2017. And this year, iPad users are arguably going to benefit the most: the new iOS 11 software could very well transform the iPad into an actual productivity device, with a redesigned dock, advanced multitasking, and new drag-and-drop features. And on both iPad and iPhone, iOS 11 brings a bigger, consolidated Control Center, a new, grid-like app switcher, and a new file-storage app called, simply, Files. \nApple\u2019s software rollouts are a lot more critical for people who aren\u2019t planning on buying new hardware this year\nThese are just a few of the features \u2014 there\u2019s even more stuff to come around Siri, Notes, screengrabs, and file markups \u2014 but one of the biggest advancements that\u2019s rolling out with iOS 11 is the launch of ARKit, Apple\u2019s new app platform for augmented reality apps. We\u2019ve already seen a bunch of AR apps on iPhone and Android (the tremendously popular Pok\u00e9mon Go is a favored example), but most AR mobile apps to date have been basic, 2D or \u201cflat\u201d imagery. ARKit, on the other hand, lets developers build advanced, 3D AR apps without requiring months of work or computer imaging expertise. It\u2019s expected to be a Big Deal in the AR world \u2014 especially since Google has also just rolled out its own version of this, ARCore, for Android devs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\n\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly when Apple\u2019s newest software will roll out \u2014 it happened in mid-September last year \u2014 but it\u2019s safe to guess that it will likely coincide with when the new hardware goes on sale. \nSteve Jobs Theater \nThere\u2019s another new product out there that most of the world hasn\u2019t seen yet, and that\u2019s Apple\u2019s new $5 billion campus in Cupertino, California. (In fact, most Apple employees still haven\u2019t been inside of it yet.) The September 12th event will mark the first public event taking place in the Steve Jobs theater, a brand-new, 1,000-seat auditorium named after the late co-founder and CEO of Apple. The auditorium is also underground, according to floor plans, which hopefully won\u2019t impact Wi-Fi signals. As always, The Verge will be on the ground (under the ground?) bringing you all of the latest news. \n\n"}
