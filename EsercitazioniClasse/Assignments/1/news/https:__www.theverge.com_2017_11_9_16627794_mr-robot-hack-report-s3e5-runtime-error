{"title": "The Mr. Robot Hack Report: A single unbroken hack", "content": " \nThe Robot crew showed off their camera chops this week, folding the entire episode into a single shot spread across multiple characters and locations. Now it makes sense why it was all commercial free. As we learned on the after show, it was actually a couple shots shot out of order and stitched together, but that\u2019s still pretty cool. \nIt also means there was really just one big hack \u2014 Angela\u2019s full-frontal assault on Evil Corp\u2019s hardware security module \u2014 clearing the way for the Stage Two attack. So in keeping with the cinematography, I\u2019m going to spend the whole Hack Report just talking about that.\nTHE KEYMASTER\nIt can be a little hard to track, but Elliot basically lays out the plan when he manages to get online after being fired. Here\u2019s the relevant voiceover:\nLog data from the dark army\u2019s backdoored machine. They\u2019re using this guy\u2019s account, Frank Bowman. He\u2019s a member of the code-signing architecture team. This is what they\u2019re doing: they want to sign their own firmware and bypass my patch. If they do that, they\u2019ll blow up the downtown recovery building.\nThere\u2019s a lot in there, but the big-picture view is pretty simple. The original plan for Stage Two was to hack these batteries into blowing up a building. Elliot stopped that by rewriting the core software on those batteries (aka firmware) to be resistant to the Dark Army hack. (In an earlier voiceover, Elliot realizes the Dark Army actually tried to perform the hack at 6:26AM that morning, but his software stopped them.) Now, the Dark Army is trying to reinstall the old software so the batteries will be vulnerable again.\nA special server for storing encryption keys\nThe problem is, you can\u2019t just install any old firmware on a device. If the batteries are going to accept the firmware, it needs to be signed by Evil Corp\u2019s software-signing keys, verifying that the new code really is coming from corporate HQ. (That\u2019s the code-signing architecture Elliot is talking about.) The Dark Army wants to steal those keys, but like most corporations, Evil Corp is keeping them in a Hardware Security Module, which is basically a special server for storing encryption keys. Having an HSM lets a company use its keys for signing without exposing the keys themselves to the network. The only way for Angela to get the keys is a manual backup to a physical USB drive, which is basically what we see her do in the server room.\nThis sounds elaborate, and it is, but it\u2019s what any decently large company should be doing. Anyone deploying code (which is everyone) needs to have an airtight system for verifying it. Otherwise, the first hacker that gets on their network will be able to deploy malware-laced software to compromise everyone in the company. Verifying the software means signing it, typically using a public-private key pair similar to the SSL system that verifies websites. The private key signs the software, so anyone who installs it can verify that it\u2019s legit. And since those keys are the absolute last thing you ever want to leak, a hardware security module is the ideal place to keep them.\nAll of which is to say, while this was probably the most extreme hack we\u2019ve seen all season, the E-Corp setup is the most normal part of it. For anyone who works in corporate IT, this stuff is familiar to the point of boring, which is why it\u2019s so interesting to see it as the center of a heist plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few more Easter eggs in there, which we talk about on the After Show, but otherwise that\u2019s it! Tune in next week, when we\u2019ll be talking with Martin Wallstr\u00f6m, who plays Tyrell. If you have any questions, hit us up on Twitter or Reddit. In the meantime, resist the pervasive influence of finance capitalism!\n"}
