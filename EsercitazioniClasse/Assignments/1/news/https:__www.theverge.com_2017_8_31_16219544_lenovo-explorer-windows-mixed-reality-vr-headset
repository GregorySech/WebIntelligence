{"title": "Lenovo\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality headset arrives in October for $349", "content": " \nMicrosoft is fully unveiling its Windows Mixed Reality platform at IFA this week, and Lenovo is the latest headset maker to introduce its own device. We saw Lenovo\u2019s headset back at CES, but now it\u2019s officially called the Lenovo Explorer. While Lenovo hinted at \u201ccloser to $300\u201d pricing earlier this year, the headset will debut at $349 without touch controllers, or $449 with the motion controllers. These mixed reality controllers are an essential part of the experience, and they work without sensors.\nLenovo\u2019s Explorer headset simply plugs into any Windows PC without any external sensor setup required, and includes the ability to run VR games and apps. Inside-out positional tracking is supported, meaning you\u2019ll be tracked in VR for movement and any motion controllers will also be detected. You can also use an Xbox One controller to play games, just like the Oculus Rift, and you\u2019ll also be able to run Microsoft Office apps with a keyboard and mouse to filter out the distractions of an office environment.\nLenovo\u2019s headset will support Microsoft\u2019s Cortana digital assistant for additional controls, and includes two 1440 x 1440 displays, one for each eye. Lenovo is planning to launch the Explorer VR headset in October priced at $349, or $449 with its bundled motion controllers. This pricing is identical to Dell\u2019s own headset, and with the controllers it\u2019s still more expensive than the current Oculus Rift bundle. We\u2019re still waiting to see if any of Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality headsets can hit the $300 mark or below.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
