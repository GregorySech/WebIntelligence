{"title": "Hisense's 100-inch 4K Laser TV can be yours for $9,999", "content": " Hisense has announced a new 100-inch 4K Laser TV  model 100L8D  that's now available to buy. It's similar to the 100H10D model announced in January at CES for $13,000, but a notable omission in today's announced spec sheet is HDR support, which may or may not explain the cheaper price of $9,999. However, Digital Trends and Twice both reported HDR10 support when the publications saw the 100L8D unveiled at the CEDIA show last month. Buyers interested in the TV will want to confirm whether or not HDR is supported before dropping a pile of cash on it.The super thin \u201cTV\u201d actually utilizes a short-throw projector to project eight million pixels onto the 100-inch passive projection screen  made by Screen Innovations . The projector uses a proprietary laser-light source rated at 3,000 lumens that the company says can be used in any lighting condition in any room \u2014 not just light-controlled home theaters, for example. That light source has a life span of 20,000 hours, so there's plenty of time to binge all your TV shows and still have years and years of viewing time leftover. The Laser TV also includes wide color gamut support and the promise of more realistic color.

There's also a built-in TV tuner and a smart TV interface with apps for YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Video, and Pandora, to name a few.The $9,999 price tag isn\u2019t too bad a deal when compared to Sony\u2019s $25,000 short throw 4K projector, or Epson\u2019s $3,000 model which only does 1080p. The Hisense 100-inch 4K Laser TV is available now from retailers across the country and through Hisense's website. The TV is expected to ship from November 24."}
