{"title": "This is the best outdoor sound system for your mansion", "content": " \nIf you already sell the world\u2019s biggest 4K TV, shouldn\u2019t you have a comparable sound system to go along with it? For C Seed, the answer is yes. The company is selling a spectacular outdoor sound system called the C Seed 125. \n\nThe C Seed 125 is a retractable, passive 2-way coaxial speaker system that can range from two loudspeakers to a 9.1 surround sound system, depending on your budget. Each speaker projects a 110-degree beam angle allowing it to cover extensive ground and reach up to 125dB. The speakers can be flush mounted into the ground as well, with a variety of materials like stone, wood, and concrete to match your decor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: C Seed\n\n\nYou can also purchase the C Seed 136, a 600-watt retractable subwoofer, to go along with the C Seed 125 sound system. Both the subwoofer and the sound system can be activated with C Seed\u2019s app on your phone, allowing for Sonos-esque control over your very, very expensive outdoor sound system. \nAs for pricing, the C Seed 125 sound system starts at $42,000 for a pair of speakers,  while the 136 will cost $23,000 for a single subwoofer. That is costly, but given the fact the C Seed 262 4K TV comes in at $539,000 \u2014 and the fact that you should probably have a mansion for these types of speakers \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t hurt your bottomline too much. \nUpdate June 21st, 1PM ET: Updated with pricing information from C-Seed.\n"}
