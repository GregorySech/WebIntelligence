{"title": "Ford\u2019s on-demand bus service Chariot expands to Seattle", "content": " \nChariot, the on-demand shuttle startup owned by Ford, is bringing its app-based, crowdsourced transit service to the traffic-choked streets of Seattle. \nChariot, which has been operating in San Francisco since 2014, is part of a recent trend of bus startups that use algorithms to develop transit routes based on user demand. Using the app, customers can book a seat in one of the company\u2019s blue-and-white shuttle vans for around $4 a trip. It\u2019s a cheaper but less convenient alternative to ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. The company sold to Ford in 2016 for $65 million; a month later it expanded to Austin. \nChariot will be a B2B service at the outset\nBut the new transportation option won\u2019t be immediately available to all Seattle residents: Ford says it\u2019s launching Chariot as an \u201centerprise commuter shuttle service, which serves companies wanting to provide transportation solutions to their employees.\u201d In other words, Chariot will be a B2B service at the outset, with companies paying for their employees\u2019 transportation to and from their homes, transit hubs, and the office. A spokesperson said the service would be expanded to other customers at a later date. The news of Chariot\u2019s launch in Seattle was first reported by GeekWire.\n\u201cChariot will offer Seattle residents an additional option for commuting to work,\u201d John Kwant, vice president of Ford\u2019s city project, writes on Medium. \u201cIts shuttles can hold significantly more commuters than a typical single-passenger vehicle, with the same physical and carbon footprint, and it\u2019s a fast, reliable and affordable transportation alternative. Going forward, we\u2019d like to see Chariot become available to a larger population of commuters.\u201d\n\u201ca fast, reliable and affordable transportation alternative\u201d\nDuring the Detroit Auto Show in January, Ford said it planned to expand Chariot to eight new markets in 2017, including one outside the US. But the company has struggled to embrace its new rebranded image as a mobility-focused, corporately nimble tech startup. Bridj, another on-demand bus service supported by Ford, went belly-up in May after failing to close a deal with an unnamed car company. \nThe 114-year-old automaker recently replaced its CEO of three years, Mark Fields, with Jim Hackett, who most recently ran the company's autonomous vehicle subsidiary known as Ford Smart Mobility. Even though Ford made strides to embrace future-focused projects like self-driving cars and on-demand mobility, its efforts went unrewarded on Wall Street. The company\u2019s stock dropped 40 percent during Fields\u2019 tenure. \n"}
