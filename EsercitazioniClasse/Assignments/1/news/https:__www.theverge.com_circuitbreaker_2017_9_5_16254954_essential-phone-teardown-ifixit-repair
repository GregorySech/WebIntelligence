{"title": "The Essential Phone earns one of iFixit\u2019s worst repairability ratings", "content": " \nAndy Rubin\u2019s Essential Phone has finally shipped to customers after half a summer\u2019s worth of delays, and that means the teardown experts of iFixit have now had a chance to rip apart the slick slab of titanium and ceramic. The verdict? iFixit gives the Essential Phone a 1 out of 10 on its \u201crepairability\u201d scale, placing it in the company of some of the website\u2019s worst offenders. That score pales in comparison to the iPhone 7 (7), Google Pixel XL (7), or even the Samsung Galaxy S8 (4). Or, in the words of the email that iFixit sent out promoting the teardown post, the phone is \u201ca hot mess.\u201d \nThe Essential Phone was always meant to be a jewel of a device, something that stands at least a few steps away from the iPhones and Samsungs of the world because of its premium fit, finish, and design. But all that meant extra trouble for getting the phone open. After finding basically nothing was accessible by entering the back of the phone, iFixit had to freeze and crack the screen to access its components. \u201cAny attempt at repair is likely to inflict as much damage as it fixes,\u201d the team writes, noting that overuse of adhesives made it difficult to even get inside.\nA couple other interesting bits:\n\nThe earpiece speaker on the top of the phone is part of the same module as the selfie camera\nAll the identifying marks (like the FCC label) that are usually found on the back of a phone are instead hidden on a small tag that lives under the SIM tray  \nThe USB-C port is soldered to the motherboard, which means it will be harder to fix or replace\n\nIt already seemed that, despite its titanium and ceramic build, the nearly full-screen Essential Phone would be a risky buy for clumsy smartphone owners. Learning how tough it could be to repair is only going to fuel that paranoia. If you own one already, or have one on the way, it\u2019s worth reading through the full iFixit report \u2014 and maybe buying a third-party case in the meantime. \n"}
