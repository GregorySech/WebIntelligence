{"title": "Trump's account was deactivated after years of employees warning Twitter", "content": " \nLast night, a rogue Twitter employee celebrated their last day with the company by deactivating President Donald Trump\u2019s account. In response, Twitter said it has \u201cimplemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again.\u201d But the company declined to offer any explanation for how it would restrict access to tools that have been accessible to a range of Twitter employees, including contractors. Former employees say the company has known about the risks of rogue employees for years \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s 11-minute deactivation isn\u2019t the first time an employee targeted an account on their way out of the company.\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s account deactivation shortly before 10PM ET on Thursday, former employees gathered in a private Slack that they use to discuss the company\u2019s travails. The rogue employee, who has not been identified, was an immediate source of fascination. \u201cWe\u2019re now referring to this individual as \u2018the legend,\u2019\u201d one former employee told The Verge. At the same time, the former employee was not surprised by the incident. \u201cPeople have \u2018dropped the mic\u2019 in the past and deleted accounts, verified users, and otherwise abused their power on the last day,\u201d the employee said. In each case, the employee said, the abuse was caught quickly and did not become public.\n\u201cPeople have \u2018dropped the mic\u2019 in the past and deleted accounts.\u201d\nThese \u201cmic drops\u201d were possible because of the broad availability of customer support tools inside Twitter. The company won\u2019t say how many people have access to the tools necessary to deactivate an account like Trump\u2019s \u2014 and after today, the number is likely much lower. But up until now, as many as hundreds of people have had access to the tools, which let employees see a broad range of information about the account. The access does not allow employees to send tweets from other users\u2019 accounts, or to read a user\u2019s direct messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the lack of protections around accounts for so-called Very Important Tweeters was a known issue inside the company, former employees said. Of particular concern is that many of the customer support staff with high-level privileges are third-party contractors located in the Philippines and Singapore. The New York Times reported on Friday that the person responsible for deactivating Twitter\u2019s account was a third-party contractor.\n\u201cPeople pressed to say, there needs to be some kind of escalation flow, or prioritization flow,\u201d one former employee said. \u201cSomeone in Singapore can\u2019t be the person to make a 3-second decision on whether to suspend a verified account. I don\u2019t know where that exists today. My hope is that those flows exist. If not, that\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d\n Indeed, while many former employees tweeted their amusement at the incident, others were concerned. \"You want to believe that Twitter has gone above and beyond to build tooling and redundancies that prevent any human error around this account given how consequential one tweet could be,\u201d another ex-employee told me of the @realdonaldtrump account. \u201cThis mistake is incredibly concerning.\"\n\u201cThis mistake is incredibly concerning.\u201d\nMultiple former employees defended the need for customer service tools enabling quick account suspensions. If a hacker obtained access to the president\u2019s account, for example, a customer service employee at Twitter would be able to quickly disable it. Similar tools exist at the other big tech companies, from Facebook to Uber. \u201cThis type of thing is possible at lots of tech companies \u2014 even if they build internal security,\u201d said one former Twitter employee who now works at another large social network. \u201cUltimately, the best you can do is lock down access to as few people as possible and make the repercussions really harsh.\u201d\nBut others worried that the incident revealed weaknesses in Twitter security that could be exploited by bad actors, including state-sponsored hackers. \u201cIt gets really chilling when you think about, what if a state is able to recruit somebody as an asset internally, and then go in and shut down accounts at a really key time?\u201d one former employee said. \u201cOr is able to obtain some sort of information about that account? There\u2019s lots of really bad, bad versions of this that could play out.\u201d \nTwitter declined to comment beyond a handful of tweets from its TwitterGov account. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures, but we take this seriously and our teams are on it,\u201d the account said. An open question is whether the former employee who took down Trump\u2019s account could be subject to criminal charges. A person familiar with the situation said Twitter had not yet been contacted law enforcement. \n"}
