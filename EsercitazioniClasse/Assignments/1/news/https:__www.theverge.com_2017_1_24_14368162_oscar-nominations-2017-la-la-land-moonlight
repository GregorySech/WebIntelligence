{"title": "Oscar nominations 2017: Moonlight and La La Land will go head-to-head at the Academy Awards", "content": " \nThe 89th annual Academy Awards are this Sunday at 8:30pm ET. Despite minor and inevitable backlash, La La Land and Moonlight remain the frontrunners for the evening. Check out the nominations for this pair along with other films before the big night.\nThe nominees for the 89th annual Academy Awards are finally in. As if there was any doubt, Moonlight and La La Land, two of the biggest movies of 2016, will face off at the awards, as each raked in the most nominations across all categories. La La Land earned a record-tying 14 nominations, including a Best Picture nod and two for Best Original Song. That number ties it with Titanic and All About Eve for the most number of nominations for a single film. All things considered, it may well be La La Land\u2019s night, but Moonlight, with its eight nominations, could still come away winning big at the show.\nThis was a big year for the Oscars. After last year\u2019s #OscarsSoWhite controversy, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences made a significant push to foster and better recognize diversity in filmmaking. That effort shows in the nominations, which went to a number of actors and directors of color. Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Naomie Harris, Dev Patel, Ruth Negga, and Mahershala Ali all got nods for their performances. Meanwhile, Barry Jenkins is up for Best Director for Moonlight. Finally, Ava Duvernay\u2019s 13th, Raoul Peck\u2019s I Am Not Your Negro, and Ezra Edelman\u2019s OJ: Made in America are all up for Best Documentary, and all deal with the spectre of racism in America. This year\u2019s effort is by no means perfect, but it\u2019s a welcome start as the Academy improves going forward.\nHere is the list of nominees.\nBest Picture\nArrival\nFences\nHacksaw Ridge\nHell or High Water\nHidden Figures\nLa La Land\nLion\nManchester by the Sea\nMoonlight \nBest Director\nDamien Chazelle, La La Land\nDenis Villeneuve, Arrival\nMel Gibson, Hacksaw Ridge\nKenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea\nBarry Jenkins, Moonlight\nBest Original Screenplay\nHell or High Water\nLa La Land\nThe Lobster\nManchester by the Sea\n20th Century Women\nBest Adapted Screenplay\nArrival \nFences \nHidden Figures \nLion \nMoonlight\nBest Actor\nCasey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea\nRyan Gosling, La La Land\nDenzel Washington, Fences\nViggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic\nAndrew Garfield, Hacksaw Ridge\nBest Actress\nEmma Stone, La La Land\nIsabelle Huppert, Elle\nRuth Negga, Loving\nNatalie Portman, Jackie\nMeryl Streep, Florence Foster Jenkins\nBest Supporting Actor\nMahershala Ali, Moonlight\nJeff Bridges, Hell or High Water\nMichael Shannon, Nocturnal Animals\nLucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea\nDev Patel, Lion\nBest Supporting Actress\nNicole Kidman, Lion\nViola Davis, Fences\nNaomie Harris, Moonlight\nOctavia Spencer, Hidden Figures\nMichelle Williams, Manchester by the Sea\nBest Documentary\nFire at Sea \nI Am Not Your Negro \nLife Animated\nOJ: Made in America \n13th\nBest Documentary Short Subject\nThe White Helmets\nExtremis\nWatani: My Homeland\n4.1 Miles\nJoe\u2019s Violin\nBest Live Action Short Film\nTimecode\nSing (Mindenki)\nSilent Nights\nEnnemis Interieurs\nLa Femme et le TGV\nBest Animated Film\nZootopia\nKubo and the Two Strings\nMoana\nMy Life as a Zucchini \nThe Red Turtle\nBest Animated Short film\nPiper\nPearl\nBorrowed Time\nPear Cider and Cigarettes\nBlind Vaysha\nBest Foreign Language Film\nLand of Mine \nA Man Called Ove \nThe Salesman \nTana \nToni Erdmann \nBest Cinematography\nArrival\nSilence\nLa La Land\nLion\nMoonlight\nBest Production Design\nArrival \nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\nHail Caesar \nLa La Land \nPassengers\nBest Visual Effects\nDeepwater Horizon \nDoctor Strange \nJungle Book \nKubo and the Two Strings\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\nBest Film Editing\nLa La Land\nMoonlight\nHacksaw Ridge\nArrival\nHell or High Water\nBest Costume Design\nAllied\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\nFlorence Foster Jenkins \nJackie \nLa La Land\nBest Makeup and Hair\nA Man Called Ove \nStar Trek Beyond \nSuicide Squad\nBest Original Score\nLa La Land, Justin Hurwitz\nMoonlight, Nicholas Britell\nLion, Dustin O\u2019Halloran and Hauschka\nJackie, Mica Levi\nPassengers, Thomas Newman\nBest Original Song\n\u201cAudition,\u201d La La Land\n\u201cCan't Stop the Feeling,\u201d Trolls\n\u201cCity of Stars,\u201d La La Land\n\u201cThe Empty Chair,\u201d Jim: The James Foley Story\n\u201cHow Far I'll Go,\u201d Moana\nBest Sound Editing\nLa La Land\nHacksaw Ridge\nArrival\nSully\nDeepwater Horizon\nBest Sound Mixing\nLa La Land\nHacksaw Ridge\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\nArrival\n13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\nUpdate 1/25 9:20am ET: A previous version of this article stated that Moonlight had earned nine nominations.
