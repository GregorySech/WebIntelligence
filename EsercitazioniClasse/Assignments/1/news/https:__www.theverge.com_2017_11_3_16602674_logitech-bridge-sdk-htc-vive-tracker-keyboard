{"title": "Logitech made a VR keyboard kit so you can type in the Vive", "content": " \nLogitech is making a virtual reality accessory kit that lets you see its keyboards inside VR, called Logitech Bridge. The Bridge system works with HTC\u2019s Vive VR headset, using a Vive tracking disk, a Logitech G gaming keyboard, and an accessory that connects the two. Once you\u2019ve hooked the tracker to the keyboard, Logitech software positions a 3D virtual keyboard model precisely over the real one. It\u2019s a pretty clever idea, although right now, it\u2019s only going out to 50 developers as a proof of concept.\nVR is associated with motion controls or gaming controllers, but a number of apps \u2014 like VR desktops \u2014 are built around keyboards. Even if you can touch-type on an ordinary keyboard, it\u2019s tough to find the right position again if you take your hands off it. Logitech\u2019s system also lets developers overlay custom keyboard layouts, which means you could replace hotkeys or shortcuts with actual labeled buttons. It works with any game or app using the Vive\u2019s SteamVR software.\nThe downside, beyond limited availability, is price: the first 50 developers\u2019 kits are free, but the system otherwise costs $150, in addition to a $99 tracker disk and the $599 HTC Vive. If you already own a nice gaming keyboard or don\u2019t like Logitech\u2019s options, you\u2019re pretty much out of luck: its model probably won\u2019t match other companies\u2019 keyboards. For now, developers can apply for one of the 50 kits using this form; applications close November 16th.\n\nUpdate: Logitech has clarified that the 50 initial development kits will be offered free.\n"}
