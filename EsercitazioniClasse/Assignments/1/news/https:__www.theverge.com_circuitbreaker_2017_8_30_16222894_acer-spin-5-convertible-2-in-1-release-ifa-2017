{"title": "Acer\u2019s Spin 5 convertible line now has Intel\u2019s 8th-gen chips", "content": " \nThe Spin 5 is one of the cheaper convertible laptops in Acer\u2019s lineup, with a starting price of $799. And at IFA this year, Acer has improved the specifications, adding Intel\u2019s newest 8th-generation Core processors.  \nAvailable in either 13-inch or 15-inch sizes, the Spin 5 offers remarkably good hardware despite its spot at the low end of Acer\u2019s convertible lineup. While the company isn\u2019t offering exact configurations or pricing, the updated Spin 5 will come with Intel\u2019s new 8th-generation processors, offer up to 16GB of RAM, and, on the 15-inch model, a dedicated Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU. The Spin 5 also has far-field microphones that let you use Cortana from up to 13 feet away, which should be great for anyone actually using Cortana as a voice-activated assistant. \nBoth sizes of the Spin 5 should be available in September in both the United States and Europe. \n"}
