{"title": "Apple\u2019s GarageBand, iMovie, and iWork apps are now completely free", "content": " \nApple is making its GarageBand, iMovie, and iWork (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers) apps totally free for all Mac OS and iOS customers as of today. In late 2013, Apple began offering the software for free to anyone that purchased a new Apple device \u2014 either a Mac or iPhone / iPad \u2014 on or after September 1st, 2013. \nOwners of older hardware who wanted to install the apps had to pay for them. iMovie and Garageband were $4.99 for iOS, according to 9to5Mac, and the iWork apps were each $9.99. Some of their desktop Mac counterparts were more expensive; iMovie was $14.99 and Pages, Numbers, and Keynote were the priciest at $19.99 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s Eddy Cue at a 2013 event. Previously, these apps were only \u201cfree\u201d with a recent Apple hardware purchase.\n\n\nBut now, no one has to pay anything to use these apps anymore. Some of them \u2014 GarageBand in particular \u2014 remain killer apps for iOS with no direct Android competitor. (Google has said that it plans to include new APIs and features focused on musicians in Android O.) Some are great, others are okay, but none of them are really bad, so they\u2019re definitely worth trying if you somehow haven\u2019t yet.\n\n"}
