{"title": "Lego House, a giant playhouse dubbed the \u2018Home of the Brick,\u2019 is now open", "content": " \nLego\u2019s hometown of Billund, Denmark, is about to see a huge boost in tourism. Set just 10 minutes away from the airport, Lego House is a new 12,000-square-meter playhouse for Lego fans of all ages, including AFOLs (that\u2019s \u201cAdult Fans of Lego,\u201d according to the company\u2019s own lingo). The building, made to look like 21 Lego bricks stacked on top of each other, is topped by a 2x4 Lego block keystone. Seven years in the making and  designed by Bjarke Ingels Group, the facade is comprised of clay tiles, to enhance the illusion of a giant house made of Lego. But that\u2019s just the outside; the inside houses a store, two exhibition areas, three restaurants, four color-coded play rooms, and 25 million Lego bricks.\nThe red, blue, green, and yellow play areas are each supposed to represent aspects of  play and learning: creative, cognitive, emotions, and social skills, respectively. There\u2019s also two outdoor play areas for physical play and spatial awareness. Take a look at the photos below and wonder if you would have been a much more well-rounded person had you played in these experience zones when you were a kid.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Lego\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m most interested in the three Lego House restaurants: Brickaccino caf\u00e9, Mini Chef, and Le Gourmet. The attention to detail in Brickaccino is super cute; there are references to The Lego Movie on the menu board, which, naturally, is made of Lego. You can peep what looks to be an \u201cEverything is Awesome\u201d smoothie, and \u201cOverpriced coffee\u201d on the menu below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Lego\n\n\nMini Chef is the family restaurant where you can build your order with four Lego bricks, feed it into the screen on the table, and watch animated lego figures \u201cmake\u201d your food. A friendly robot waiter will then deliver your food to you via conveyor belt in an adorable Lego lunchbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Lego\n\n\n\nAnd of course, Le Gourmet is exactly what it sounds like: an upscale Nordic / French brasserie with prices starting at $37 and up for the three- or four-course lunch menu, and $67 and up for the four- or six-course dinner menu. There\u2019s also a full night Lego \u201cuniverse\u201d experience, which includes \u201cbubbles, snacks, wine, coffee and petit four\u201d for around $195. There\u2019s little to no chance I will ever be making it out to Le Gourmet, so I hope we\u2019ll be seeing it on Chef\u2019s Table soon.\nEntrance to the terrace, restaurants, and store are free, but admission to the experience zones is 199 Danish krone, which is approximately $31 USD. And for those of us who can\u2019t make it out to Denmark anytime soon, Lego also has a 774-piece replica model set of the House, which is part of the Lego Architecture line.\n"}
