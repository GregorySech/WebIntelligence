{"content": " \nHarvard\u2019s robot bees have really evolved over the years. The RoboBee project was first unveiled in 2013, when the bots were only capable of takeoff and flying. Since then, they\u2019ve been modified to stick to surfaces and swim underwater, and now their creators say they\u2019re able to dive in and out of water \u2014 a big achievement for a tiny robot bee. \nGetting out of the water is usually pretty easy for humans, but it\u2019s a challenge for anything as small as an insect. The RoboBee weighs just 175 milligrams (that\u2019s 14 times lighter than a cent), and at this size, surface tension is like extra strong gravity: it\u2019s 10 times the robot\u2019s weight, and three times its lifting power. \u201cThe force from surface tension feels like an impenetrable wall,\u201d said Harvard professor of engineering Robert Wood in a press release. Imagine that next time you\u2019re getting out of the bath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe redesigned RoboBee with its four buoyant outriggers and its central chamber, for collecting (and exploding) gas.\nImage: Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\n\n\nTo solve this problem, researchers from Harvard\u2019s outfitted the RoboBee with a tiny combustible rocket, giving it the oomph needed to break the water\u2019s surface tension. Gas fills a chamber in the RoboBee\u2019s interior, it\u2019s lit by an internal spark, and woosh, it shoots out of the water. Or, as it\u2019s described in a paper published in the journal Science Robotics today: \u201cThe robot [assumes] a ballistic trajectory.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s cleverest about this system is that it actually uses the water itself as fuel. A pair of tiny electrolytic plates convert the liquid into oxyhydrogen, a violently explosive gas. (And if you\u2019re wondering why we don\u2019t use this sort of gas more often, it\u2019s because it costs a lot of energy, in the form of electricity, to produce.) \nTo fit in all this extra gear, the RoboBee had to be redesigned, with a central gas chamber added, along with four buoyant outriggers \u2014 robot floaties, basically. Still, there\u2019s no space on board for sensors or a sophisticated guidance system. So although the new RoboBee can fly, land in water, paddle about, then burst out again, it can\u2019t be remotely controlled, and it isn\u2019t yet capable of doing useful bee tasks like pollinating the crops we all depend upon to live. Hopefully that\u2019s next on the list. \n", "title": "Robot bees can now dive in and out of water using tiny combustible rockets"}
