Its examination of the phone shows that while it\u2019s similar in some respect to the iPhone 7, you really want to make sure that you don\u2019t break that glass back. \nApple claimed that the glass in the phone\u2019s back is really strong, but now that it\u2019s out in the hands of users, we\u2019ll get a good idea of how durable it really is when people start dropping it. It\u2019ll be worth making sure that it doesn\u2019t break: the company confirmed yesterday that repairing the phone\u2019s glass back will be more expensive than the screen under AppleCare+. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: iFixit\n\n\niFixit\u2019s teardown shows why. It\u2019s really difficult to get to if you need to replace it. The phone\u2019s wireless charging coil is attached to a reinforcement panel, which is securely glued to the back. The team notes that their efforts left the backing plate \u201ca bit bent out of shape.\u201d \niFixit points out that despite the upgrade, there\u2019s a lot in the phone that looks like an iPhone 7, with some similar components. Ultimately, the phone ranks a six on iFixit\u2019s ranking, lower than the iPhone 7 teardown score. It\u2019s jam-packed with stuff, but it does score higher than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 8, which got a four, and the Essential Phone, which earned a one. \n"}
