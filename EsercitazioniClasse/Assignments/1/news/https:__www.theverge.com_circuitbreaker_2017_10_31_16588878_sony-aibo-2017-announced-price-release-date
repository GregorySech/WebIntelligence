It uses deep learning technology to analyze the sounds and images coming through Aibo\u2019s array of sensors, and uses cloud data to learn from the experiences of other Aibo units and owners.\nA lot has happened in the world of tech since Aibo dogs were last on sale, and the new model accordingly has some changes.
