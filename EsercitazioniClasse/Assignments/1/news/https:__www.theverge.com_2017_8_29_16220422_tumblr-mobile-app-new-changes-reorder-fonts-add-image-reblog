{"title": "Tumblr app adds fancy fonts and lets you reorder text and images in posts", "content": " \nTumblr\u2019s latest update brings several new features for mobile users, some of which desktop users already enjoy. Now users can react to things they reblog with photos, which opens up a range of possibilities like attaching reaction gifs to everything or engaging in a collaborative photo essay. Tumblr also added more text styles for text posts, so that users can now add headers, make lists, and use serif fonts, a Courier-like typewriter font, and cursive. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these features \u2014 letting you reblog with photos and make lists \u2014 were already available on desktop. But Tumblr is also granting mobile users the ability to shift around blocks of text and images, which makes a big difference when editing posts on a smaller screen. This feature imitates the fluidity of copy and paste on desktop but with the ease of a touch screen.\nWith the implementation of this feature and the fancy font, I\u2019m more persuaded to restore my Tumblr app from my iCloud. It\u2019s a series of small updates the company\u2019s been adding over the past year, including filters, stickers, and live-streaming.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
