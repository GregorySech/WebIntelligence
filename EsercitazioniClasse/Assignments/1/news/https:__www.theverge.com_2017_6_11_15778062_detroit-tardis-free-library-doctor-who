{"title": "A Detroit Doctor Who fan built a replica TARDIS library for his neighborhood", "content": " \nIn recent years, free libraries have popped up across the country in an effort to bring access to books to local communities. Detroit is now home to a new free library in the form of a replica TARDIS from the BBC show Doctor Who. \nThe library is a life-sized replica of the time traveling Doctor\u2019s famous time machine. Dan Zemke explained that he wanted to do something with the empty lot across the street from his home in Detroit, and decided to construct a free library that combined two of his passions: the BBC television show and reading. \nZemke told The Verge that a reading program called Reach-Out-and-Read at his workplace helped inspire the project. \u201cThat program ensures that every child that comes into the [Advantage Health Center] leaves with a book.\u201d When he began thinking about building a TARDIS replica, he noted that he wanted it to be useful to the community. \u201cIt hit me to combine my work's reading program with the TARDIS project to make a creative outlet for books in the community.\u201d\nHe pitched the idea to his father, who has a workshop with \u201cany and every tool that you can imagine.\u201d The two began work last Labor Day, and were aided by an online building community called Tardis Builders. \u201cWhenever we got stuck on a particular part of the TARDIS,\u201d he said, \u201cwe would look on the forums to see what other people did.\u201d The final structure stands almost 10 feet tall, weighs almost a ton, and its front shelves holds around 140 books. \nWhen visitors open the library\u2019s front doors, they\u2019re greeted with some panels with a painted mural that depicts the TARDIS\u2019s interior layout under the Twelfth Doctor, Peter Capaldi. \u201cWe wanted to give people a sense that they were looking into the actual interior,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can slide the mural panels to reveal shelves on the other side and to take [or] leave a book.\u201d\nPart of that design is practical: given the size of the box, he didn\u2019t want it to be misused, so he \u201ccame up with the idea for this false wall at the front to stop people from living in [it]. We also put more shelving in the back to hold more reserve books and to limit space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Don Zemke\n\n\nOnce the replica was finished in early June, Zemke installed it in a lot owned by his brother on corner of Vermont Street and Warren West Avenue in Detroit. \u201cI wanted to help make our neighborhood a bit cooler and make that spot somewhere that people would want to check out. Plus, who doesn't want a life-size TARDIS in their community?\u201d \nSince its installation, Zemke says that the library has received considerable attention from pedestrians and drivers, with families, teachers and other fans stopping by to check it out. \u201cFoot traffic has been pretty huge for a lesser-known street off a major road in Detroit,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really positive experience so far.\u201d The library is now open, and visitors are welcome to take a book, or leave behind one of their own. \n\n"}
