{"title": "Everything coming to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now in October", "content": " \nHalloween season is finally upon us, so you might expect your streaming service of choice to be filled with dozens of new slasher flicks, gothic thrillers, and serial killer movies. (The whole creepy killer clown thing is currently being handled in both movie theaters and on cable TV, so you\u2019re already covered there.)\nWhat\u2019s fascinating, though, is that there\u2019s actually not a huge influx of traditional horror titles coming in October \u2014 but what is on its way shouldn\u2019t be missed. We\u2019ll start with Netflix, because the service is getting director Julia Ducournau\u2019s cannibal movie (and festival favorite) Raw, the first season of its new David Fincher thriller Mindhunter, and Richard Kelley\u2019s Donnie Darko. There\u2019s also this really tiny show called Stranger Things, which is getting a second season on October 27th. I almost thought about leaving that mention out, because there is such a rabid fervor over the return of Stranger Things that most of you may have already noted the release date in your calendars. But then I rewatched the trailer, and the Michael Jackson Thriller reveal gave me chills again, so there you go. \nLeaving Netflix in October? Titanic (not technically a horror movie, but judge for yourself), Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining (really?), and the complete Friday Night Lights series. Is nothing sacred?\nAmazon Prime is leaning into the Halloween season with the release of Lore, its six-episode series adaptation of Aaron Mahnke\u2019s terror and folklore podcast. That\u2019s coming on October 13th, and over the course of the month, the service will also be releasing Doug Liman\u2019s The Wall, the studio\u2019s original film starring John Cena and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as two US soldiers that get pinned down by a sniper in Iraq. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s incredible Arrival will also be coming to Amazon Prime in October, as will director Mary Lambert\u2019s adaptation of the Stephen King classic Pet Sematary.\nAs for HBO\u2026 well HBO is just getting down to business with the scary movies. The service will be adding Split, Lights Out, The Darkness, and The Purge: Election Year. It will be adding The Ninth Gate, in which Johnny Depp acts like an actual human being while searching for a book that can raise Satan, and Constantine, which isn\u2019t really a horror movie but is nonetheless horrifying for a host of reasons. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, if those selections alone weren\u2019t enough to send your heart racing, with sweat popping out on your brow as you wonder just what bad decisions led you to this place in life, there is one more thing that will surely push you over the edge: the 2006 remake of The Pink Panther.\nThe complete list of movies and shows for all three services is below.
