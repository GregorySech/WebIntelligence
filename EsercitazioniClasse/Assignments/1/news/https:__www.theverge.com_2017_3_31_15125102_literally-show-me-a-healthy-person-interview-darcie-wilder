{"title": "How Darcie Wilder\u2019s stunning debut novel was born on Twitter", "content": " \nDarcie Wilder\u2019s debut novel literally show me a healthy person doesn\u2019t sit well. It\u2019s 97 pages of full-throttle disclosure, complete with semi-obvious booze, cum, and heartbreak details, as well as less-obvious 9/11 jokes and quips about what it feels like to lose a parent. Taken piece by piece, it\u2019s hundreds of bits of hard-to-stomach flash fiction. But as a whole, it\u2019s a gritty, moving portrait of grief and the chaos it kicks off in people\u2019s brains. When I spoke to Wilder on the phone and told her the book physically exhausted me, she said she likes to remind people who are reading it that they \u201creally don\u2019t have to finish it.\u201d But it\u2019s worth it to push through. (I\u2019m saying this as a reader who took a nice, necessary subway nap right after putting it down.) \nI\u2019ve followed Wilder\u2019s personal Twitter and her work at MTV News for quite a while, so I\u2019ve seen parts of literally show me a healthy person before \u2014 in tweet form. Encountering them again feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the best way, suddenly getting context for something that was previously just a joke to be retweeted. \n\n\n  sometimes   brands   start   tweets   with   a   period   before   an @   even   tho   there   are   so   many   fun   emojis  \u2014 MTV News (@MTVNews) April 29, 2016\n\n\n\nWilder writes in the way people talk on the internet, but moving toward a point, instead of just filling the time and netting likes. literally show me a healthy person opens with a diatribe against Godiva Chocolate spam emails, a stellar paragraph about what it\u2019s like to be alive and turn on your computer every morning. It immediately makes sense when she says \u201cwhen i use emoticons like <3 and :( instead of emojis it means i mean it more\u201d or \u201chey what\u2019s up youtubers welcome to my channel and this episode we\u2019ll be throwing out my trash for the first time in three weeks.\u201d Here we are, she\u2019s saying, online again, and it\u2019s not that smart or useful to act like as if it\u2019s so far removed from everything else. \nWith that in mind, I asked Wilder to tell me about how this book came to be. We also talked about why Twitter is so beautiful and why it\u2019s a total nightmare. \nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nSome of the one-liners in the book are things you\u2019ve tweeted before. Do you think people who follow your Twitter account will have a different experience reading the book? \n\n\ni still use twitter because we all need to devote our lives to at least one thing that wants us dead\u2014 darcie wilder (@333333333433333) March 9, 2017\n\n\n\nThe two are pretty different forms. There\u2019s some crossover, but the way the book functions is like a piece of art, and Twitter is in spurts. Everyone\u2019s 140-character lines are mixed in with everyone else\u2019s stuff. I think a book is a work of art that communicates something intentional, and the experience of reading it is so different from scrolling on the computer. It\u2019s repurposed with different intention. \nThe sentence before something informs that one. The way you structure paragraphs is a completely different experience. And Twitter has a lot of baggage and occupies this crazy space in the world \u2014 I think it\u2019s a crazy different experience. \nHow did you decide when to bring pop culture references into the mix? There are a few in the book, but not compared to Twitter\u2019s constant stream of them.\nOn Twitter, a lot of pop culture references seem like they\u2019re going to be dated. They\u2019re very timely and of a moment, and will expire. So I try to make [references] more timeless, or explain why it\u2019s important in that moment, or just show the significance of them through the lyrics that are relevant, as opposed to using an artist\u2019s career as a punchline. That artist\u2019s career is going to change and fluctuate, and it\u2019s not going to mean the same thing later, and that could not work. It could be really cool, in a way, but it\u2019s hard to base your art around someone else\u2019s persona. I don\u2019t mean \u201ctimeless\u201d like using the word \u201cthou\u201d or something. I like a lot of art from the \u201890s, and I feel like a lot of it is timeless in the way the feelings transcend time. \nSince most of the book is such short pieces, and there are no chapters, how did you figure out the sequencing?\nI played around with chapters, but then it really felt wrong. The book, in a lot of ways, is about a feeling of when you\u2019re either caught off-guard, or you\u2019re asked a question, and then there\u2019s a hesitancy or a feeling of anxiety or just a stunned silence, and then a ramble. Initially, the book name was just a bunch of letters I slammed on a keyboard. I had to change it, because practically, that was unrealistic and unfair of me to make everyone deal with that. The letters ended up being the last line of the book, so very much, it\u2019s just one whole thing. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Tyrant Books\n\n\n\nTo break it up, I think, would be against the point of the book, where that\u2019s just all of these things, and you have to deal with it all. [You\u2019re] just assaulted by line after line after line. It\u2019s the way a brain works, where the brain just can\u2019t turn off. I think it needed to be just one thing. And it\u2019s a relatively short book.\nThere was a lot of shuffling. I started writing this basically in 2012. That\u2019s when it started taking form. It took me a while to give myself the permission to have the structure, which is flash-fiction bits. A lot of the stuff had been written before, but figuring out where it is in a collage, or like a diary film, and figuring out the structure and the texture, was a lot of work. I had to [find] where themes would reoccur, space out stuff, and assemble it less like other pieces I had written, and more like when I used to edit film. I would edit a sequence and put it somewhere and figure out how it was going to read with callbacks to other scenes. There was a lot of shuffling, and then I would notice a hole where I needed a theme to come back, and I would write for that. \nWhat kind of films did you make or hope to make? \nI did narrative and documentary, but my heart was in the lyrical, experimental documentaries where I was cataloging a lot of things around me. I would pick a thing, for example one of them was \u201cmaps,\u201d and then make something trying to investigate what a map is. But it would be informed by the things around me. It would be taking the scene and seeing where my life fit into it. It was a back-and-forth between what I was supposed to be doing, vs. what the footage I was recording was. It was a lot of reflection, and very personal and autobiographical, but also editorialized. I was definitely presenting things in a specific way. And I liked recording and finding archival stuff that I had tucked away. It was a pretty similar experience [to writing the book] \u2014 having an archive of material I had already made, and then stuff I had planned out, and stuff I made in response to those two working together. \nWere you starting your Twitter account around the same time you were doing these projects? \nYeah, I guess so. I was in college. I think I started in 2010, but I don\u2019t think I really had a sensibility for it for another few years, until I was out of college and worked on the form and started really interacting with it. A very big difference [between documentary film and social media] is that Twitter and social media are so much the infrastructure of an industry. When you change your Facebook status, it\u2019s very different from making a work of art, even if you sell [that art]. It has a role in something like much wider. Then something that\u2019s just a text document, I think, that\u2019s intrinsically a personal work. \n\n\ni thought i wanted a community of like-minded artists. then i found media twitter. and now i only wish for death\u2014 darcie wilder (@333333333433333) March 29, 2017\n\n\n\nHow has Twitter changed for you since then?\nWell, first of all [in 2010], I think I didn\u2019t know how to live my life. It\u2019s a different place now. Twitter changes \u2014 the temperature of it changes a lot, depending on who\u2019s using it for what. It\u2019s changed so much since the election, and in the past few years. There have been these wide migrations of how people use it. 2010 was the \u201clive-tweet what you\u2019re doing\u201d age, and people were barely even using it for jokes. Now it\u2019s evolved into something very different, and there\u2019s a language about it. There are threads and quote-tweets.\nI followed a lot of people for professional reasons, and that changed my timeline for the worse. Not my co-workers, but just people around New York, and then I got a flavor of the Twitter people always talk about. Right now, I\u2019m a little sore about the whole thing, and I just like seeing what my friends are doing, mostly. I think my favorite Twitter account right now is @belatweets2u. She\u2019s just, like, a teenager in Baton Rouge I think, and really vibrant and excited. She\u2019s very funny, and not cynical or jaded. \nWeird Twitter and Sad Twitter used to be separate, but now they\u2019re the basic language of the way people generally talk on Twitter.\nIt\u2019s hard. You can\u2019t call someone out and say someone\u2019s experience isn\u2019t true and they\u2019re not feeling anything, but I think you can tell when someone is either derivative or more hacky than others. And to some extent, everyone is a hack. It\u2019s not a bad thing to be influenced by other people, but there are some things I\u2019m tired of online. \n\u201cIt\u2019s usually a recipe for disaster to just do something with the intention of getting a specific reaction.\u201d\nPeople who are experimenting with different things and saying things that are true to them will always be good. It\u2019s a different muscle to work from something you\u2019re feeling, vs. what you think will be popular. It\u2019s usually a recipe for disaster to just do something with the intention of getting a specific reaction. It gives me a weird feeling, based on someone speaking from a more true place.\nTwitter as a tool is constantly evolving, because the people who made it had no idea how people would use it. Have any of those changes been important to you?\nThe edit-tweet thing, everyone is always like, \u201cThis should have happened!\u201d But it seems antithetical to the idea of having something recorded. The timestamp would mean nothing. I feel like that would be used for evil pretty quickly. Especially with favs and retweets and stuff. That seems like a nightmare. Quote-retweets were really good, because that increased the ability to have a conversation and refer back to things, and it has another visual thing where you could have the caption interacting with the initial tweet, or the picture. \nInitially I was so scared of people retweeting themselves, but now I think it\u2019s like, \u201cWhatever, who cares?\u201d I still hate the difference between favs and likes, and I refuse to call them \u201clikes,\u201d because it just changes things so much. Changing the word for it to be something inherently positive is so gross to me, so forced. I liked Twitter because it wasn\u2019t like Facebook or Instagram. I miss the star, the ambiguity of something being a favorite. As for the abuse features, the harassment and fucked-upness of everything is ridiculous. The bots are taking me out of it a lot. I\u2019m just so sick of eggheads and bots and stuff like that. \n\u201cdeleting tweets is my favorite feature of Twitter.\u201d\nSo you\u2019re anti-editing \u2014 do you ever delete tweets?\nSometimes I\u2019ll tweet with the intention of only having it up for a little bit. If I tweet something and then I feel like it\u2019s not properly communicating my intention and will be misunderstood, I\u2019ll delete it. I think it\u2019s funny to just throw something up there and delete it in a second, or whatever. It\u2019s pretty much my favorite. Deleting tweets is my favorite feature of Twitter. It feels so good to delete. \nYou mentioned in another interview that Twitter changed your brain. What did you mean by that? \nI think Twitter changed the way I think about a lot of things, because of the ideas I\u2019ve learned from Twitter \u2014 just, like, the actual content of people\u2019s thoughts. But also, I think it\u2019s restructured the way I sell my thoughts to someone, and try to make them interesting. Turning an observation into a joke, or turning an observation into a sentence other people can think about, has taught me how to communicate with others better. \nIt has also taught me how to reduce my thoughts. I think I\u2019ve been more declarative with how I think and feel, but that can also feel reductive. I\u2019ve never really had a great attention span, so I\u2019ve been able to work with it better because of Twitter. But I also haven\u2019t worked on it very much because of Twitter. I\u2019ve been able to get away with consuming and absorbing other people\u2019s thoughts. And I\u2019m pretty much always on Twitter. Within the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been more intentional about changing that. I just think the addictive feature of it is so much. There\u2019s always new stuff to read, and rarely are they very amazing or important thoughts, but there\u2019s always something to do. It\u2019s like always being bored, but never having that solitude of boredom that I had as a kid, where you would just be staring out of a subway window, listening to music. I kind of miss that.\nliterally show me a healthy person will be available April 3rd through Tyrant Books\n\n\n    Related\n  \nTalking to @sosadtoday\u2019s Melissa Broder about Jeremih, internet addiction, and being a teen for life\n\n\n"}
