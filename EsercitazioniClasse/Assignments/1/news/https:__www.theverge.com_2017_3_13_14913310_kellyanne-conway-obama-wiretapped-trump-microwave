{"title": "Microwaves aren't spying on Trump", "content": " \nOver the past two decades, we\u2019ve filled our homes with devices capable of listening in on our conversations and surreptitiously recording our movements if we tap a bad link or install something that we shouldn\u2019t, accidentally handing access over to a hacker. But the list of vulnerable devices includes phones and computers and connect speakers \u2014 not microwave ovens.\nOver the weekend, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tried to defend the president\u2019s unproven claims that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration by citing a story she read about how gadgets can be hacked to spy on you. \u201cThere was an article this week that talked about how you can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets, any number of different ways. And microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera,\u201d Conway told The Bergen Record on Sunday. \u201cSo we know that is just a fact of modern life.\u201d\nConway is right, to a point, that some of this is a fact of modern life, and a scary one at that \u2014 computer webcams have long been a target of hackers. Microwave ovens, however, are not regarded as hacking targets. And, as far as we\u2019re aware, are not able to be turned into tools for surveillance.\n\u201cWe image things with microwaves all the time, but not in the way that it sounds like she was implying.\u201d\nAppliances that can be hacked to spy on you usually include a microphone or a camera, if not some other method for receiving data. But microwave ovens don\u2019t typically include either of those.\nThat means it would be up to the microwaves themselves \u2014 the actual waves, that is \u2014 to somehow create and transmit images. So is that possible?\n\u201cWe image things with microwaves all the time, but not in the way that it sounds like she was implying,\u201d Robert McNees, a theoretical physicist at Loyola University Chicago, writes in an email to The Verge. \u201cFor instance, we make maps of the relic microwave radiation left over from the early universe. And I think I\u2019ve heard of medical application of microwave imaging, too[.]\u201d\nBut those applications are pretty far from what\u2019s happening inside a typical microwave. \u201cWith a regular, consumer microwave oven?\u201d McNees asks. \u201cThat sounds far-fetched to me.\u201d\nWired asked a researcher who works on microwave imaging and got a similar response. \u201cI can\u2019t conceive of an effective way to do any of it from your microwave oven,\u201d University of Massachusetts-Amherst researcher Stephen Frasier told the publication.\nPart of this goes back to the reason you can\u2019t turn on a microwave while it\u2019s open: they\u2019re designed to contain all emissions, lest they harm someone. That would make it fairly difficult for a microwave to spy on you, since its waves can\u2019t escape the metal box that generates them. And you would probably notice \u2014 and freak out \u2014 if your microwave turned on while the door was ajar.\n\u201cOur microwaves do not come equipped with microphones or any other equipment that would enable the activities Ms. Conway suggested.\u201d\nThis was probably more of a misstatement on Conway\u2019s part than a full on attempt at spreading an alternative fact, and she did try to walk the quote back today, telling CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, \u201cI\u2019m not Inspector Gadget. I don\u2019t believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d Explaining how or if Trump was spied on is not her role, Conway explained. \u201cI\u2019m not in the job of having evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what investigations are for.\u201d\nThe Verge reached out to several microwave manufacturers for comment. Three got back to us. GE answered our question on whether the company\u2019s microwaves can spy on people with a clear \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cGE Appliances takes the privacy of our owners\u2019 information very seriously,\u201d a spokesperson continued. \u201cOur microwaves are designed and manufactured for the sole purpose of cooking food. Our microwaves do not come equipped with microphones or any other equipment that would enable the activities Ms. Conway suggested.\u201d\nPanasonic also said the feat would be impossible. \u201cThere is no way that Panasonic microwave ovens can do such things,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cMicrowave ovens are not designed that way.\u201d\nAnd an LG representative said, \u201cAccording to our engineering team, LG microwaves are not able to be used as surveillance devices!\u201d\nIf President Trump is worried about devices spying on him, there are more obvious places to look.\nUpdate March 14th, 8:12AM ET: This story has been updated with comment from Panasonic.\nUpdate March 15th, 9:04AM ET: This story has been updated with comment from LG.\n"}
