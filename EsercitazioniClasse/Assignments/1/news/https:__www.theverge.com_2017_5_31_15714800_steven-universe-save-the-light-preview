{"title": "Steven Universe: Save the Light will build out the beloved series\u2019s mythology", "content": " \nSteven Universe has emerged as one of the most important cartoons on television today \u2014 few Western animated series are equipped to handle ideas like queer identity and the brutal cost of war so gracefully. As the show\u2019s fandom has grown, the title character has become steadily more ubiquitous, with an ever-expanding presence in children\u2019s books, comics, and even video games. In 2015, Grumpyface Studios released the well-received Steven Universe: Attack the Light for iOS and Android. It\u2019s a charming tie-in game \u2014 a love letter to Nintendo games like Paper Mario and The Legend of Zelda \u2014 and, as a story, it feels perfectly at home in Steven\u2019s world.\n\u201cThis needs to be the biggest \u2018Steven Universe\u2019 adventure we can imagine.\u201d\nThis year, Cartoon Network and Grumpyface are releasing Steven Universe: Save the Light, a direct sequel, and the studio\u2019s first full-fledged console release. For this effort, the team \u2014 with help from the TV series\u2019s creator, Rebecca Sugar \u2014 aimed to build a more ambitious game set in the universe of the show, with new characters, richer gameplay mechanics, and a longer campaign that rewards diehards and series newcomers alike. More significant than that, though, is the game\u2019s attempt to strike at the heart of Steven Universe\u2019s driving philosophy: that our relationships with the ones we love and the things we care about make us stronger.\n\u201cThis is our first console game, so right away, we knew this was gonna be a big undertaking for us,\u201d Grumpyface director and owner Chris Graham told The Verge earlier this month. \u201cThis time, we wanted to go deeper. You\u2019ve got the 3D world with all sorts of realms to explore. You\u2019ve got side quests, a crafting system, character perks, upgrades, customizable teams. Really, from [the] top down, we said to ourselves, \u2018This needs to be suitable for consoles, and be the biggest possible Steven Universe adventure we can imagine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat much was obvious in the opening moments of the demo version we previewed earlier this month. From the beginning, it plants players in a fully realized, 3D version of Beach City, Steven\u2019s fictional hometown. The open world isn\u2019t as vast as, say, Hyrule in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it\u2019s easy to see that a great deal of care went into re-creating the boardwalk from the show, complete with its shops, hideaways, and the colorful supporting cast milling around. (Graham also admits that the game\u2019s style was inspired by Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, so the team\u2019s love for Nintendo is as clear as ever.) \nIn Save The Light, Steven explores a variety of worlds on his quest to rescue the ancient light weapon he befriended in the first game. Joining Steven on his adventure are the Crystal Gems \u2014 alien warriors Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl \u2014 along with Steven\u2019s best friend, Connie, and his father, Greg Universe. As in the series and original game, the Gems have a variety of combat abilities, like Pearl\u2019s spear and beam attacks, and Garnet\u2019s magic gauntlets. Connie and Greg add even more depth to the action; Connie\u2019s sword makes her a frontline fighter, while Greg\u2019s guitar lets him amplify the abilities of other party members. Steven, with few offensive abilities of his own, serves as the support character, since he can heal his friends, shield them from danger, and even resurrect them if they\u2019re defeated. Not only are these abilities useful in battle, but the developers brought some of them \u2014 like Greg\u2019s musical talents \u2014 into the open world, too, adding platforming and puzzle-solving elements to the game.\n\u201cWho you\u2019re trying to impress or support is a huge part of the gameplay.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we did the first game, we had all these big, ambitious ideas that we had to put into a smaller game,\u201d Sugar says. \u201cNow, we get to expand on everything, especially a lot of the relationship dynamics that in these small ways, sort of snuck into the first game. Like, you tell a joke that you know one of the Gems will laugh at. Who you\u2019re trying to impress or support has gone from a kind of Easter egg to being a huge part of the gameplay.\u201d\nThat relationship system is key to the game, and it\u2019s part of what makes the adventure fit so well alongside the series it draws from. During battle, the game rewards players for defending teammates, or executing a perfect combo by having characters build up relationship points with each other. Those points build up over time, and when maxed out, they can unlock new abilities. For instance, Steven and Connie can gain the ability to fuse into Stevonnie, an \u201cexperience\u201d who embodies the best of both characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStevonnie is a walking thesis statement for the show, and the fusion\u2019s presence is not only fun for fans, it also hammers home how important it was to the game\u2019s creators to have Steven Universe\u2019s emotional underpinnings influence their work. \u201cFor me,\u201d Sugar says, \u201cthe big goal is to have everything that I get the chance to see or touch [in the game] have the feeling that the show has.\u201d\nThe designers sought to establish a tighter connection with the show\u2019s story. Since Steven Universe\u2019s 2013 debut, the show\u2019s lore about the Crystal Gems and the war against their Homeworld has expanded alongside Steven\u2019s coming-of-age story. Where Attack the Light was related to that larger narrative in a fairly oblique way, Graham says this new game will connect that story with the sweep of the show\u2019s mythology.\n\u2018Save the Light\u2019 will connect with the show\u2019s mythology in surprising ways\n\u201c[Rebecca] had a great vision for how this could fit in, and we\u2019re so happy to be able to have our own little take on Steven Universe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna find out a lot of extra little things about the show from the game, I think.\u201d\nSteven Universe: Save the Light will land on the PS4 this summer and other consoles in the months ahead.\n\n"}
