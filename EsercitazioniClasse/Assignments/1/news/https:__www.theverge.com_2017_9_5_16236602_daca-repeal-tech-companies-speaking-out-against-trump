{"title": "Here are the tech companies speaking out against a DACA repeal", "content": " \nIn response to the announcement that the Trump administration will be shutting down the Obama-era \u201cDreamers\u201d immigration program, Silicon Valley companies are speaking out. Otherwise known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Dreamers program enables nearly 800,000 undocumented individuals who came to the US as children to continue to live, study, and work in the United States. To qualify as a Dreamer, individuals must have come to the country when they were younger than 16, and continue to meet a series of stringent rules. \nThough during the campaign Trump vowed to shut down DACA on the first day of his presidency, the administration has wavered on that commitment. In a February press conference, Trump said, \u201cWe are gonna deal with DACA with heart. The DACA situation is a very difficult thing for me, as I love these kids, I love kids. I have kids and grandkids, and I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and, you know, the law is rough.\u201d Trump has not clearly indicated when or how he would rescind DACA, but observers speculate that a decision is imminent. Earlier this morning, Trump tweeted: \n\n\nCongress, get ready to do your job - DACA!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2017\n\n\n\nSilicon Valley has criticized the Trump administration\u2019s controversial immigration policies before. February\u2019s seven-country immigration ban drew an almost universal rebuke. \nIn a LinkedIn post last Thursday evening, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote, \u201cWe care deeply about the Dreamers who work at Microsoft and fully support them. We will always stand for diversity and economic opportunity for everyone.\u201d \nAnd hundreds of tech leaders co-signed a letter on Thursday titled \u201cLeaders of American Industry on DACA.\u201d Signatories included Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Box CEO Aaron Levie, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Hewlett CEO Meg Whitman, Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sam Altman of Y Combinator. The letter reads:\n\nSince the country\u2019s birth, America has been the land of opportunity \u2013 welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers, and businesses. In turn, our nation has been strengthened and fueled by the energy, drive, and passion of immigrants. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned about new developments in immigration policy that threaten the future of Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to America as children.\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 800,000 Dreamers the basic opportunity to work and study without the threat of deportation, is in jeopardy.  All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered with our government, submitted to extensive background checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and paying income taxes.  More than 97 percent are in school or in the workforce,  5 percent started their own business, 65 percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies count Dreamers among their employees.\nUnless we act now to preserve the DACA program, all 780,000 hardworking young people will lose their ability to work legally in this country, and every one of them will be at immediate risk of deportation. Our economy would lose $460.3 billion from the national GDP and $24.6 billion in Social Security and Medicare tax contributions.\nDreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\nWe call on President Trump to preserve the DACA program. We call on Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act.\n\nIn addition, the following organizations have made statements in response to the DACA repeal:\nFacebook\nAs well as signing the tech leaders letter published on FWD.com, Mark Zuckerberg wrote a post on his personal Facebook page. \n\nI stand with the Dreamers -- the young people brought to our country by their parents. Many have lived here as long as they can remember. Dreamers have a special love for this country because they can't take living here for granted. They understand all the opportunities they have and want nothing more than the chance to serve their country and their community. And Dreamers deserve that chance.\nWe need a government that protects Dreamers. Today I join business leaders across the country in calling on our President to keep the DACA program in place and protect Dreamers from fear of deportation. We're also calling on Congress to finally pass the Dream Act or another permanent, legislative solution that Dreamers deserve.\nThese young people represent the future of our country and our economy. They are our friends and family, students and young leaders in our communities. I hope you will join us in speaking out. You can read our letter at: Dreamers.FWD.us/Business-Leaders.\n\nUber\nUber\u2019s CTO, Thuan Pham, also signed the FWD.US letter, and an Uber spokesperson added this statement by email:\n\"Dreamers grew up here, live here, and are contributing to our communities and our economy. Their contributions make America more competitive and they deserve the opportunity to work, study, and pursue the American dream.\"\nPham released a more personal statement after the announcement:\n\nWhen I was 10 years old, I left Vietnam with my mother and younger brother, crammed with 470 other people without life jackets onto an old fishing boat to Malaysia. It was a perilous and terrifying four-day journey\u2014with major storms threatening to sink us, and pirates with guns and knives who robbed us and could kill us as well. We were the lucky ones who survived the 50 percent odds of that sea crossing. When we arrived in Malaysia, we were rejected as refugees and had to turn around and take another several days to reach Indonesia with our boat. When we reached the US as refugees, we had to start our lives over with empty hands, but it was the hope and promise of the American Dream that kept us going.\nImmigrants often risk their lives for a chance at freedom and opportunity, and our country remains the world\u2019s beacon of freedom and opportunity. Immigrants have built and contributed to America since its very beginning, and are at the center of our social fabric and economic prosperity. My heart breaks to see so many people who are in the same situation today that I was in many years ago.\nToday, the Trump Administration announced it will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave children of illegal immigrants the chance to stay in the US and contribute to their communities and the economy. I was proud to sign the FWD.us letter on behalf of Uber urging President Trump to preserve the program.\nOur community has always been about what brings people of every background together. We\u2019ll continue to stand by immigrants who want nothing more than to contribute to our country and pursue the American Dream.\n\nUber\u2019s new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, also tweeted his support for Dreamers.\n\n\nIt's against our values to turn our backs on #DREAMers.  Everyone deserves a chance to work, study and contribute - the #AmericanDream!\u2014 dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) September 5, 2017\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\nLast Thursday, numerous responses emerged from Microsoft. President and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote the following post on the company\u2019s blog:\n\nWe are deeply concerned by news reports about changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that are under consideration. These changes would not only negatively impact thousands of hardworking people across the United States, but will be a step backwards for our entire nation.\nLet me explain why.\nThe roughly 800,000 \u201cDREAMers\u201d who are registered beneficiaries of DACA were brought to this country as young children. Although undocumented, these young people grew up in the United States, attended our schools, built careers and started businesses, bought houses, started families and became part of our communities. The DACA program did not grant them a permanent immigration status \u2014 it only provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, requiring renewal every two years. But it provided work authorization, allowing them to integrate as contributing members into our nation\u2019s workforce and society.\nEnding DACA will drastically disrupt the lives of these individuals who willingly came forward to register with the federal government. They could lose their jobs and risk deportation. This repeal will also have significant economic consequences. Studies estimate that ending the program could cost the American economy $460.3 billion in GDP (gross domestic product) and $24.6 billion in Social Security and Medicare tax contributionsover the course of a decade.\nOur country will also lose the tremendous talent of these individuals. DACA recipients bring a wide array of educational and professional backgrounds that enable them to contribute in crucial ways to our nation\u2019s workforce. They are part of our nation\u2019s universities and work in every major industry. They are artists, advocates and health care providers. They help meet the needs of our communities and our companies.\nWe experience this in a very real way at Microsoft. Today we know of 27 employees who are beneficiaries of DACA. They are software engineers with top technical skills; finance professionals driving our business ambitions forward; and retail and sales associates connecting customers to our technologies. Each of them is actively participating in our collective mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. They are not only our colleagues, but our friends, our neighbors and valued members of the Microsoft community.\nThese employees, along with other DREAMers, should continue to have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions to our country\u2019s strength and prosperity. Instead of ending DACA, our policymakers and legislators should enact the DREAM Act or other permanent solution for DREAMers \u2014 a goal that continues to have bipartisan support.\nOur country has always been a beacon of opportunity. If we are determined to preserve American leadership and excellence, let\u2019s build lasting solutions that extend dignity and opportunity while promoting our country\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nAnd later in the day, CEO Satya Nadella followed up with a more personal post on LinkedIn. \n\nToday Brad Smith published a blog post sharing our deep concern about potential changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that are under consideration. You can read Brad\u2019s post here.\nFor me, it comes back to two things: the enduring principles and values that have made the United States what it is, and my own personal story.\nAs I shared at the White House in June, I am a product of two uniquely American attributes: the ingenuity of American technology reaching me where I was growing up, fueling my dreams, and the enlightened immigration policy that allowed me to pursue my dreams.\nThere is no question in my mind that a priority must be to create more jobs and opportunity for every American citizen. On top of this, smart immigration can help our economic growth and global competitiveness.  \nAs a CEO, I see each day the direct contributions that talented employees from around the world bring to our company, our customers and to the broader economy. We care deeply about the DREAMers who work at Microsoft and fully support them. We will always stand for diversity and economic opportunity for everyone. It is core to who we are at Microsoft and I believe it is core to what America is.\nThis is the America that I know and of which I am a proud citizen. This is the America that I love and that my family and I call home. And this is the America that I will always advocate for.\n\nSmith also released another statement after Trump\u2019s formal announcement of the policy, saying Microsoft is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the decision and calling on Congress to pass legislation to replace DACA.\nFor Microsoft, the first step is clear. The administration has given Congress six months to replace DACA with new legislation. We believe this means that Congress now needs to reprioritize the fall legislative calendar and move quickly with new legislation to protect these 800,000 Dreamers. This means that Congress should adopt legislation on DACA before it tries to adopt a tax reform bill. This is the only way, given the number of legislative days Congress has scheduled over the next six months, we realistically can expect Congress to complete DACA legislation in time.\nHe also said that Microsoft would \u201cwork as needed with other companies and the broader business community to vigorously defend the legal rights of all Dreamers.\u201d\nFor the 39 Dreamers that we know of who are our employees, our commitment is clear. If Congress fails to act, our company will exercise its legal rights properly to help protect our employees. If the government seeks to deport any one of them, we will provide and pay for their legal counsel. We will also file an amicus brief and explore whether we can directly intervene in any such case. In short, if Dreamers who are our employees are in court, we will be by their side.\nThe full statement is posted here.\nMozilla\nThough Mozilla wasn\u2019t a signatory to the FWD.us letter, the company had its own message.\n\nWe believe that the young people who would benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) deserve the opportunity to take their full and rightful place in the U.S. The possible changes to the DACA that were recently reported would remove all benefits and force people out of the U.S. - that is simply unacceptable.\nRemoving DREAMers from classrooms, universities, internships and workforces threaten to put the very innovation that fuels our technology sector at risk. Just as we said with previous Executive Orders on Immigration, the freedom for ideas and innovation to flow across borders is something we strongly believe in as a tech company. More importantly it is something we know is necessary to fulfill our mission to protect and advance the internet as a global public resource that is open and accessible to all.\nWe can\u2019t allow talent to be pushed out or forced into hiding. We also shouldn\u2019t stand by and allow families to be torn apart. More importantly, as employers, industry leaders and Americans -- we have a moral obligation to protect these children from ill-willed policies and practices. Our future depends on it.\nWe want DREAMers to continue contributing to this country\u2019s future and we do not want people to live in fear. We urge the Administration to keep the DACA program intact. At the same time, we urge leaders in government to enact a bipartisan permanent solution, one that will allow these bright minds to prosper in the country we know and love.\n\nSlack\nIn addition to signing the FWD.us letter, a Slack spokesperson wrote:\nWe strongly oppose ending DACA, which would harm thousands of hard working young people who make our community thrive and eliminate their contributions to the US economy.\nAirbnb\nCo-founder and CEO Brian Chesky tweeted:\n\n\nDreamers belong in our country, our companies and in our communities. I\u2019m proud to support them https://t.co/VNud3AcytU\u2014 Brian Chesky (@bchesky) September 1, 2017\n\n\n\nVerizon\nIn a Friday morning post on their site, Craig Silliman, Verizon executive vice president of public policy and general counsel wrote: \n\nDiversity isn't just some politically correct concept, a liberal agenda item, the right thing to do. Diversity is important because it strengthens our companies, our organizations, our society. This is particularly important to remember as the nation debates the right policies to move our country forward. One of those important debates involves the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program. There currently are nearly 800,000 individuals in the United States who arrived in the country as undocumented immigrants when they were children. They are referred to as the \"Dreamers.\" They grew up in this country and they are now investing in it and contributing to it. Almost all of them are now in school or in the workforce, and many have started their own businesses. At Verizon we have benefited immeasurably from the diverse experiences, talents and work ethic of our many immigrant employees, as have most other large companies and our country as a whole. The Dreamers are a truly valuable resource for our economy and our society. The DACA program has ensured that they could continue to be a part of our schools and companies and communities, but now there is a risk that this program will end. At a time when we are fighting to ensure that the US economy remains strong on the global stage, it is vital that we not lose the advantage of the Dreamers with their energy, diverse experience and backgrounds. This is exactly the type of diverse talent that has made the United States successful to date and on which our success will depend in the future.\nBut leveraging diversity to strengthen our society isn\u2019t just the responsibility of political leaders. We all must do our part in our individual roles through our everyday actions, large and small, to harness the potential of diversity to create more successful outcomes. For example, I am a lawyer and a key part of a lawyer's day-to-day work is trying to get someone else to accept your point of view. We advocate, we negotiate, we argue, we reason. So the measure of our success isn't just the elegance of our contract or legal brief or closing argument - it is whether it persuaded the person on the other side of the table.  So a good lawyer must have not only intelligence but also empathy, experience and an openness to the idea that not everyone sees the world through the same lens that we do. While we know academic excellence isn\u2019t limited to one race, gender or group of people, we sometimes would like to think that we can measure quality on some numerical scale - SAT scores or IQ tests or GPAs - but that simply isn't the case. If Verizon's legal department were filled with only one type of person we wouldn't be effective because we wouldn't have the diversity of thought to be creative and to persuade others who don't have the same world view. The strength of an organization comes from bringing together a diverse set of ideas and approaches to find the best one for any given situation. And a diverse set of ideas comes from a team with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds. So diversity isn't just a nice thing to have; it is essential for an organization's success.\nBut diversity often doesn't arise naturally. We all have our internal biases. It usually is easiest to surround ourselves with those who confirm our world view, who have a similar background that we do. That means that if we just follow the path of least resistance, we will end up with less diverse organizations, and therefore organizations that are less effective. If we want to build great teams, we have to make a bit of an effort to ensure diversity. This is an important point:  diversity programs are NOT about lowering the bar for quality; they are about setting up a process to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to be evaluated to ensure that we get the best overall quality in our organizations.\nWhether we are talking about policy issues on the national stage or the numerous decisions each of us make throughout our daily lives, one thing is clear: strengthening our country by embracing and utilizing the diversity of all people that call the U.S. home won\u2019t just happen. We will have to be intentional, courageous and show real leadership. I\u2019m hopeful that we can all come together as a nation to find ways to preserve DACA and benefit from the passion, energy and drive of the Dreamers. At Verizon, we\u2019ll continue to look for that higher gear to find ways to invest in our diverse workforce as a way to propel our company forward to be better, faster, and stronger. \n\nTim Cook\nAlong with signing the FWD.us letter, Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted out his support for Dreamers over the weekend:\n\n\n250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values.\u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 3, 2017\n\n\n\nCook also sent an email to employees after the announcement, published by MacRumors:\n\nAmerica promises all its people the opportunity to achieve their dreams through hard work and perseverance. At Apple, we've dedicated ourselves to creating products that empower those dreams. And at our best, we aspire to be part of the promise that defines America. \nEarlier today, the Justice Department announced that President Trump will cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in six months if Congress does not act to make the program permanent. \nI am deeply dismayed that 800,000 Americans -- including more than 250 of our Apple coworkers -- may soon find themselves cast out of the only country they've ever called home. \nDACA recognizes that people who arrived in the United States as children should not be punished for being here illegally. It lets these Americans, who have successfully completed rigorous background investigations, go to school, earn a living, support their families, pay taxes and work toward achieving their dreams like the rest of us. They are called Dreamers, and regardless of where they were born, they deserve our respect as equals. \nI've received several notes over the weekend from Dreamers within Apple. Some told me they came to the U.S. as young as two years old, while others recounted they don't even remember a time they were not in this country. \nDreamers who work at Apple may have been born in Canada or Mexico, Kenya or Mongolia, but America is the only home they've ever known. They grew up in our cities and towns, and hold degrees from colleges across the country. They now work for Apple in 28 states. \nThey help customers in our retail stores. They engineer the products people love and they're building Apple's future as part of our R&D teams. They contribute to our company, our economy and our communities just as much as you and I do. Their dreams are our dreams. \nI want to assure you that Apple will work with members of Congress from both parties to advocate for a legislative solution that provides permanent protections for all the Dreamers in our country. \nWe are also working closely with each of our co-workers to provide them and their families the support they need, including the advice of immigration experts. \nOn behalf of the hundreds of employees at Apple whose futures are at stake; on behalf of their colleagues and on behalf of the millions more across America who believe, as we do, in the power of dreams, we issue an urgent plea for our leaders in Washington to protect the Dreamers so their futures can never be put at risk in this way again. \nDespite this setback for our nation, I'm confident that American values will prevail and we will continue our tradition of welcoming immigrants from all nations. I'll do whatever I can to assure this outcome. \n\n\nIBM: The official Twitter account of IBM Government & Regulatory Affairs tweeted the company stands by Dreamers,\n\n\nWe stand by our IBM #Dreamers. #DACA pic.twitter.com/SJA7IsrzKF\u2014 IBMPolicy (@IBMpolicy) September 5, 2017\n\n\n\nSundar Pichai: Google\u2019s CEO tweeted,\n\n\nDreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers. This is their home. Congress needs to act now to #DefendDACA. #WithDreamers\u2014 Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) September 5, 2017\n\n\n\nY Combinator: Founder Sam Altman tweeted,\n\n\nTo my friends here via DACA:I can't believe Trump is doing a political high-wire act with your lives. I'm so sorry.  This is cruel.\u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) September 5, 2017\n\n\n\nWe will continue to update this post as notable responses come in.\n"}
