{"title": "Valve teases Dota 2 card game for 2018", "content": " \nIt was some time near 4AM last night / this morning, as I was watching Team Secret face off against Team Liquid in the Dota 2 championships, that I thought I should quit watching as well as playing Dota. This game is too addictive a substance. But Valve has other ideas.\nTeased during the online broadcast of The International, the $23 million Dota 2 tournament currently going on, is a new Dota card game called Artifact. In fact, Valve calls it the Dota card game, though most of the details of what it will involve are up for speculation and debate. I\u2019ll let Polygon\u2019s Arthur Gies give the summary of everything we know so far:\nArtifact is a card game based on Dota 2 involving three boards and a selection of characters from Valve\u2019s flagship game, though other details remain light. The game was announced just before the final match of Day 2 of TI7 by event host Sean \u201cDay9\u201d Plott, who gave a vague description of the game that seemed to indicate it would involve building barracks, creeps, and lanes (after suggesting the announcement was not related to Dota 2). Comparisons to Blizzard\u2019s Hearthstone seem inevitable.\nFor me, the one bit of respite from Dota 2 was in the fact it wasn\u2019t available to play on mobile devices, which Valve has evidently decided is an untapped opportunity. The majority of the immense prize pool for The International comes from player contributions and purchases of in-game cosmetics, so there are a great many enthusiastic fans of the game who are likely to make Artifact an instantly popular game. Dota has a huge following in China as well as the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. It\u2019s also consistently the most played game on Steam.\nShould the new card game pan out in the same fashion as Hearthstone did for Blizzard, Valve would have its first mobile hit on its hands, having until now limited itself to desktop and console games. Artifact is slated to launch in 2018.\n"}
