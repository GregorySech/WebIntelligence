{"title": "Disney\u2019s new ESPN streaming service is launching next year", "content": " \nDisney\u2019s bombshell announcement today that it would be building its own branded direct-to-consumer streaming service, and ending its licensing deal with Netflix, came with another nugget of news: the previously announced all-new ESPN streaming service is launching next year. We first heard about this service last year, when Disney acquired a minority stake in BAMTech, the MLB-founded video juggernaut behind many of the most popular sports and TV streaming services. \nDisney is making a big play in sports streaming, thanks to BAMTech\nNow, with Disney announcing a majority stake in BAMTech thanks to a new $1.54 billion investment, the company is preparing to launch a dedicated over-the-top ESPN service. It will be the first time the sports broadcaster has offered an independent, multi-sport service that doesn\u2019t come with its own licensing complications and isn\u2019t tied to an existing third-party service like Sling. \nIt\u2019s unclear how Disney and ESPN plan to price it, but the service may notably exclude core ESPN programming like SportsCenter, which sounds as if it will remain exclusive to cable subscribers. In a statement, Disney describes the new product in broad terms, confirming that it will include a host of games from every major sports organization in the US and purchasable add-ons for those who closely follow individual sports like baseball, hockey, and soccer: \nThe ESPN-branded multi-sport service will offer a robust array of sports programming, featuring approximately 10,000 live regional, national, and international games and events a year, including Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, and college sports. Individual sport packages will also be available for purchase, including MLB.TV, NHL.TV and MLS Live.\nDisney says the service won\u2019t be spun out into a new app, but rather it will live inside the existing ESPN app, which is accessible on a number of devices like smartphones, game consoles, and streaming TV boxes. The company says those who pay for cable will be able to access additional content, like direct feeds of ESPN\u2019s live cable broadcasts, by authenticating through a provider. \u201cFor many sports fans, this app will become the premier digital destination for all their sports content,\u201d the statement reads. \n"}
