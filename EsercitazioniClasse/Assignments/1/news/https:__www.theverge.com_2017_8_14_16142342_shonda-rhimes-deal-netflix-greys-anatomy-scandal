{"title": "Netflix signs Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes to multi-year deal", "content": " \nAcclaimed television writer and producer Shonda Rhimes has signed a multi-year deal with Netflix, where she\u2019ll produce new series and work on other projects for the streaming company. The deal means Rhimes, known for her work as the creator and show runner of Grey\u2019s Anatomy and Scandal, will depart ABC after 15 years with the broadcaster. She will be reportedly paid around $10 million a year at Netflix, and will be accompanied in the move by longtime collaborator Betsy Beers. \n\u201cShonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, in a press statement. \u201cHer work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best.\u201d Shows from ShondaLand \u2014 Rhimes\u2019 production company \u2014 including Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away with Murder will continue to air on ABC. These shows are also available to stream on Netflix (depending on your region.)\nThe move to Netflix means Rhimes will be able to work in a wider range of genres and formats, according to Variety. \"ShondaLand\u2019s move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company,\u201d said Rhimes. \u201cTed provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for \u2014 the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach.\u201d\nThis deal marks another step in a content arms race where companies like Netflix and Amazon are carving up exclusive deals that would usually only be available to TV networks \u2014 at least back in their heyday. Just last week, Amazon pinched The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman from AMC. While a single show might be valuable, having a creator on board where all their new shows will be exclusive to one platform is especially lucrative. Netflix currently has 104 million subscribers in over 190 countries, so the appetite for high-quality, original content remains huge.\n\n"}
