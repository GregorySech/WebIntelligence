{"title": "Google\u2019s AI powerhouse DeepMind is opening its first international lab in Canada", "content": " \nAlthough it was bought by Google in 2014, AI firm DeepMind has always been true to its British roots \u2014 expanding its offices in London, working closely with UK institutions like the NHS, and even teaching in the country\u2019s universities. Now, though, the company is opening its \u201cfirst ever international AI office\u201d \u2014 in Edmonton, Canada. \nIt\u2019s a natural fit for DeepMind, which has close links with the AI research community in Edmonton\u2019s University of Alberta. The company says nearly a dozen Alberta grads have joined its ranks, and the firm has sponsored the university\u2019s machine learning lab for a number of years. Richard Sutton, professor of computing science at Alberta, was also DeepMind\u2019s first outside advisor, and will head up the company\u2019s new base along with colleagues Michael Bowling and Patrick Pilarski. Seven more researchers will join them to fill out the initial DeepMind Alberta team. \nSutton is a particularly notable figure in the AI community, known for his pioneering work in the field of reinforcement learning. This is a technique that allows computer agents to teach themselves through trial-and-error, with researchers programming virtual rewards when they do the right thing. It sounds like a simple tool, but it has sophisticated results. DeepMind has used a variation of this method \u2014 known as deep reinforcement learning \u2014 in some of its most notable success, including creating an AI that can learn to play video games. \nIn a press statement, Sutton described the University of Alberta as \u201cthe world's academic leader in reinforcement learning,\u201d making it an well-chosen partnership. He added that the new lab will \u201cturbo-charge the research ecosystem\u201d and \u201cdrive a whole host of new scientific breakthroughs right here in Canada, propelling the field of AI forwards into exciting new territory.\u201d\nAlthough DeepMind is calling this lab its first \u201cinternational research office,\u201d this description isn\u2019t quite complete. A number of the company\u2019s researchers also work in Google\u2019s Mountain View headquarters, to \u201cbridge the gap between Google and [the] team in London.\u201d These employees work in the \u201capplied\u201d side of DeepMind (the other side is pure research); looking at ways to use its AI in real-life situations, like cutting the energy bills in Google\u2019s data centers. According to a recent report from Business Insider, the Mountain View contingent now numbers 20 researchers. \n"}
