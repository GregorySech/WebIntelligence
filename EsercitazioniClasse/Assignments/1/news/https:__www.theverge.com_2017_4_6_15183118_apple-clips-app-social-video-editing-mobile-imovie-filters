{"title": "Apple\u2019s Clips app is iMovie for the next generation", "content": " \nWhen I opened up Apple\u2019s new Clips app yesterday, as I\u2019ve been doing for the past few days, I was greeted with the same photo-capture screen that\u2019s prioritized in all the social \u201cstory\u201d apps. Take a picture! Capture video! Share! Share everything! they scream at you. I added some text overlays and emoji, and fumbled my way through Live Titles, the feature that\u2019s distinctive to Apple Clips. And eventually, I shared my Clips. But it took a while. Because Clips take a while. \nAfter Apple first announced its Clips video-making app a couple weeks ago, a lot of people \u2014 including me \u2014 wondered whether this was the company\u2019s attempt to grab some of the attention that\u2019s been siphoned by social apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. After using the new Clips app for the past five days, it\u2019s become clear to me that this is not Apple\u2019s attempt at a \u201csocial\u201d app, at least, not in the way that social networks work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, it\u2019s a video-making app that borrows some features from other apps. It\u2019s an app that requires some thought and a little more work than a Snap or tweet or \u2018gram does. These days, it\u2019s possible to use those apps in public and with friends in a way that doesn\u2019t feel terribly rude, whether it\u2019s because everyone else is doing it or because the point is to share something quick and raw. With Clips, prepare to spend at least a few minutes making something share-worthy. \nClips is now available in the App Store\nBut that\u2019s not a bad thing: it\u2019s a distinctly Apple-like approach to mobile video. Parts of the app are also fun to use. There\u2019s at least one element of the app that feels like it could use a whole redesign, and the question still remains as to whether this app is one that iPhone (and iPad) users will feel compelled to use before they use their favorite social apps. But overall, this is a kind of next-generation iMovie that I\u2019m willing to bet a healthy portion of Apple\u2019s user base will be happy to use. \nIf you ever said, \u201cI wish iMovie was less about dissolves and transitions and more about adding cool filters and text,\u201d then you are in luck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClips is free to download, and it\u2019s available on iOS only. I wrote previously about its core features, but to summarize: you can shoot new photos or videos from within the app, or you can pull from your existing iPhone library. From there, you can add text, filters, overlays, emoji, and something Apple is calling \u201cposters,\u201d which are opaque transition cards. You can also add music, pulling either from your iTunes library or a selection of other instrumental music tracks curated just for the Clips app. \nClips are created in a square format, and are added to a basic timeline at the bottom of the screen. You can add individual video clips up to 30 minutes long to this timeline; and the total run time of a finished Clips video can be as long as 60 minutes. It\u2019s also created and shared in 1080p HD, if your source video is HD. This is the kind of stuff that makes it much more of a video creation app than a Snapchat competitor. \nThe Clips app breaks a kind of social code: it takes more time than the quick, raw clips of other social story apps\nAnd then there\u2019s Live Titles. Live Titles is the app\u2019s big differentiator, and utilizes voice recognition technology in a way that\u2019s both clever and confusing. Rather than punch in text or scribble it on the phone\u2019s touchscreen display, with Clips you\u2019re supposed to narrate your thoughts out loud. You can opt to have those words included as audio, text, or both. This option was partly driven by the way people are watching video online now \u2014 text only, no audio \u2014 which makes sense. Unfortunately, the way the feature is designed doesn\u2019t make as much sense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting a Live Titles style, you\u2019re then supposed to hold down the record button and speak. If you want to mute your voice in a video, you have to tap a mic button. This isn\u2019t exactly intuitive; most times you\u2019re tapping a microphone icon to start recording your voice. While you\u2019re speaking, the text doesn\u2019t appear on the Clip; it\u2019s processed after the fact. If you want to undo Live Titles, you don\u2019t unselect the Live Titles icon; you have to go into the Live Titles options and select \u201cNone.\u201d \nYou also just can\u2019t simply type in text to start from Live Titles; you have to go to the Overlays tab for that. So yeah, it\u2019s complicated. \nConsidering that Apple plans to include a Help section in the app when it goes live, I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m not the only person who has given early feedback that it\u2019s the most confusing part of the app. It\u2019s a cool concept, but I really hope Apple considers seriously simplifying this. \n\n\n.@LaurenGoode is just repeatedly yelling \u201cMy Cat Loves Gadgets!\u201d into her phone and I\u2019m wondering what the best intervention options are.\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) April 4, 2017\n\n\n\nDespite that, making Clips is easy, especially if you ignore Live Titles. I\u2019ve made Clips videos of my cat (of course), a bowl of pho, a recent vacation, and California-esque things I\u2019ve done in a single day. The comic filter is cool, and it renders the effect on photos and videos as you\u2019re capturing them, not after the fact. Individually, the features are reminiscent of the features in other apps \u2014 sepia-toned filters, location and time stamps \u2014 but combined, it all feels distinctly Apple. Example: one of the text overlays is a familiar blue iMessage bubble. \nThe comic filter is cool; one of the text overlays is a blue iMessage bubble\nWhen you tap the share button \u2014 assuming you want to share your Clips when you\u2019re done, unless you just like to make videos to look at all by yourself, which is possible \u2014 all of the usual suspects are there, from Vimeo to Facebook to YouTube to Mail. And iMessage is supposed to be slightly optimized for this. The app will use facial recognition technology to determine who is in your clips videos and prioritize those contacts in the share function; although, I haven\u2019t tested that much, since I was using the app in advance of its official release and couldn\u2019t share the videos to all of my contacts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo while Clips isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s answer to Snapchat, or Instagram, or Facebook Stories, or Prisma, or the ill-fated Qwiki, there is still an element that\u2019s inherently shareable. Which is to say, after making Clips this week, I actually wanted to share them. In a way, Apple has again renounced the responsibility of being a social network while also encouraging a kind of network-exclusive interaction. Just like the blue bubbles of iMessage will give you away, so will some of the features of this app. \nJust don\u2019t try to make a fancy Clips video to share while you\u2019re out in social settings. It takes too darn long, at least at first.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate, April 6th 1:30PM ET: Article updated with new download links. \n"}
