{"title": "Watch Lucid Motors\u2019 electric car accelerate to a brain-melting 235 mph", "content": " \nI\u2019m on record as being a fan of the California electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors and its forthcoming first production model, the Air. I rode in the engineering prototype at CES earlier this year, and enjoyed the alpha prototype\u2019s fully reclining back seat during the New York Auto Show a few months later. But we still have a long wait until the first model comes out in 2019, so Lucid will need to go that extra yard to keep us interested. That\u2019s probably what motivated them to release a video of the Air driving at a speed that borders on offensive. \nBack in March, Peter Rawlinson, Lucid\u2019s chief technology officer, told me the Air recently hit 160 mph on the test track, and that he expected to get that up to 200 mph fairly soon. They achieved that feat in April, hitting 217 mph \u2014 a milestone that soon became moot after removing the vehicle\u2019s speed-limiting software and taking it for a breezy summer drive at 235 mph earlier this month. \n\nHow does this compare to the Tesla Model S P100D, which has already earned the reputation as the quickest EV on the market with an impressive 0\u201360 mph sprint in 2.9 seconds? Hard to say, since there doesn\u2019t seem to be much information out there about Tesla\u2019s top speed without its speed-limiting software that keeps it to 155 mph. In fact, most luxury automakers limit their high-performing models to the same speed, thanks to a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d between Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW a number of years ago to reduce the number of fatalities on the Autobahn. \nLucid\u2019s engineering prototype has an insane, 1,000-horsepower engine, but the first production model will have a slightly more modest 400 horsepower. It will cost $60,000 and have 240 miles of electric-powered range. Lucid also expects to sell more expensive 315- and 400-mile range versions.\nAre electric car makers insecure?\nLucid goes into a lot of the planning that went into its speed test in its blog post, which includes this boastful promise: \u201cWhile it may be the top speed achievable on that day, with those conditions, and at this stage of development for the Alpha Speed Car, it is not the final production top speed for the Lucid Air.\u201d\nThere is an obsession among electric car manufacturers with horsepower and how many seconds it takes to achieve the fabled 0\u201360 mph. (Jalopnik had a good piece on this recently.) Tesla, Faraday Future, and Lucid Motors are all guilty of engaging in this rather pointless contest. My theory is that it speaks to an insecurity among EV makers about whether their cars can stand up to the muscle cars and Ford F150s that have squatted in the frontal cortex of the American car buyer for decades. They worry whether their EVs are too quiet, too sustainable, and too (ugh) green to appeal to these consumers. This leads to an over-emphasis on performance, which is fine, but I seriously wonder how important this is to most potential buyers. \nThat said, for evidence that there\u2019s an audience for electric cars being driven really, really fast, look no further than the Formula E racing series, which is coming to Brooklyn this weekend. And who\u2019s supplying the battery packs for seasons 5 and 6? Why, none other than Lucid Motors. The company is promising that Lucid\u2019s battery will last twice as long as the current battery, and run for the entirety of the Formula E race. \n\n"}
