{"title": "Legion gets the mystery box formula right where Westworld failed", "content": " \nThanks to the rise of J.J. Abrams and the success of Lost, a significant corner of genre fiction has been in thrall to the \u201cmystery box.\u201d As Abrams said during that now-infamous TED Talk back in 2007, the idea of a mystery box represents \u201cinfinite possibility.\u201d It\u2019s an enticing premise: any reader or viewer is naturally compelled by the need to know what might be in a closed box, letting their imagination run wild with the potential. \nThe problem arises when creators treat the mystery box as an end unto itself, when the mystery is confused for why people are invested in the story or franchise. Abrams himself betrayed the limits of this particular kind of conceit when he said, \u201cI started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge.\u201d This thinking leads to unfulfilling conclusions and plots with faulty foundations. Westworld, despite becoming a massive cultural phenomenon last year, fell early and often into that trap by focusing on its puzzles, turning its characters into cyphers without believable wants and needs.\nA good mystery box show needs good characters\nI think the key to making a mystery box work is in balancing the unknown against well-written, relatable characters. 10 Cloverfield Lane, a film that felt like Die Hard in a post-apocalyptic bunker, got that right. And if Lost excelled at anything, it was in making its audience care about its cast. Now Legion, FX\u2019s new drama set in the X-Men universe, is showing the strengths of the mystery box style of storytelling just three episodes into its run. Thanks to its characters and careful world-building, it\u2019s swiftly becoming a show that earns its audiences obsessions and theories about what it all means \u2014 without sacrificing its own dramatic quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHBO\n\n\nComparisons between Legion and Westworld were immediate. As Polygon already noted, Redditors are going back and forth right now about how much Legion reminds them of Westworld in how mind-melting it is. \u201cThis is going to be Westworld levels of mind fuck I can tell,\u201d one wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t feel smart enough for this show,\u201d wrote another. \u201cLike Westworld all over again.\u201d\n\u201cThis is going to be Westworld levels of mind fuck.\u201d\nThe parallel makes sense, superficially speaking. Both shows are dense, technically stylish sci-fi thrillers. Both shows weave rich mythologies across multiple timelines, with Westworld being set in a simulated Wild West peopled with robots that may or may not have consciousness and Legion set in a world filled with super-powerful mutants that may or may not all exist in the lead\u2019s head. And both shows lend themselves to theories about who and what is real, where the plot is going, and if there isn\u2019t something more sinister running beneath the surface.\nWhere Westworld differs is in privileging its mysteries and philosophical meditations over character and storytelling. Take William, who is much more an idea than a character. He doesn\u2019t convey any fully realized motivations beyond a desire to be a good person for Dolores\u2019 benefit, and his transformation into the Man in Black is an overreaction to the idea that suffering defines humanity, if not just a twist for twists\u2019 sake. Or consider Maeve: she discovers that she\u2019s a machine and that she\u2019s being controlled, so she sets out to free herself. That\u2019s a powerful and relatable motivation, but the series undermines it by questioning whether or not her actions are dictated by her programming. Don\u2019t get me wrong: exploring the nature of humanity is a worthwhile pursuit, and I loved that about the show. But dancing around what it means to be human instead of creating memorable characters with goals turns the series into a lecture series instead of good TV.\nTV shows shouldn\u2019t be transparent Pez dispensers\nCompounding the problem is how the show conceals information \u2014 no matter the illogical gymnastics \u2014 to maintain the mysteries until the final episode. So much energy is spent hiding the connection between William and the Man in Black, the true identity of Westworld employees, and the point of the Maze, that the show rapidly became a transparent Pez dispenser, slowly and arbitrarily dispensing treats even though we could see every piece of candy just waiting to be served.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegion, on the other hand, is laser-focused on its main character by design. Despite being about a mutant with the power to alter reality itself, the story the series lays out is straightforward. David believes he\u2019s a schizophrenic, but he might also be the most powerful mutant alive. So, after learning that people with powers are being targeted by a shadowy government organization, he chooses to learn to control his abilities to save his loved ones and maybe even the world. That\u2019s all David knows, and, as a consequence, all we know. The show establishes David as a relatable person with an understandable purpose: in order to save the world, he needs to better himself. That the show subverts our expectations by asking us to question whether or not what\u2019s happening on-screen is in his head is destabilizing, but always secondary. What he learns about himself drives him and the story forward. And when David learns something, we learn it, too. The show doesn\u2019t withhold for the sake of mystery. Rather, the mystery is a product of its core dramatic premise.\nBut what about all the podcasts and trend pieces? you might ask. Isn\u2019t it a sign a show\u2019s good when it makes everyone want to talk about it every week? To that I say, sure, that\u2019s one way a show can be enjoyable. Picking apart a mystery in public is fun, especially when it\u2019s in fashion. But when a series seems more intent on surprising its audience every week instead of creating relatable characters whose decisions, and not the machinations of some offscreen influence, inform the plot, then the balance is in favor of mystery being the reason to tune in. Solving a mystery without caring about who it affects and why is a hollow endeavor. \nSolving a mystery without caring about who it affects is a hollow endeavor\nBy the end of Westworld\u2019s first season, I felt satisfied in knowing that some of my theories had been confirmed. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I had deep feelings for or investment in any character. Mystery, to use the Abrams phrase, wound up being more important than knowledge. That was compelling to a point. But the show still feels like prologue for the real show waiting to happen. On Legion, the stakes were set and clarified from the outset and the questions it asks are more meaningful because they have weight in its world. It\u2019s the mystery box done right, and you don\u2019t need a couple dozen podcasts to see that as great storytelling.\n"}
