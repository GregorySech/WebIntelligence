{"title": "This gorgeous ruler was created specifically for digital designers", "content": " \nThere are a ton of niche design objects that have been tossed up onto Kickstarter for funding, but every now and again, there\u2019s one that will really catch your eye. Case in point, this high-end designer ruler.\nThe Lindlund is billed as a ruler for creative types and designers. Its Swedish creators, Jens Marklund and Axel Lindmarker, say that while they worked on various projects, they would often rotate through a bunch of specialty rulers, each with different measurements on them. \u201cWe have really precise (and pricey) rulers that are only used for measurements,\u201d Marklund told The Verge, \u201cbut since they are made out of thin plastic film, you\u2019d have to use a second ruler for cutting. The ones we liked the sizes of were either too basic, made out of plastic or flimsy steel, and would slip if you tried cutting with them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Jens Marklund\n\n\nTheir solution was to design their own ruler, one that included several different measurements, with an eye toward digital design. \u201cThe idea of the ruler came from the simple premise of \u2018if you can\u2019t find it, then make it,\u2019\u201d explains Marklund. In addition to the regular English and Metric scales, they\u2019ve included picas and pixels. (12 inches, 30 centimeters, 72 picas, and 1,800 pixels). The pair wanted the tool to be useful for digital designers, so they\u2019ve included markings specifically for iPhone and iPad screens. \n\u201cIf you can\u2019t find it, then make it.\u201d\nThe project\u2019s Kickstarter page outlines the various features that make up this particular instrument. It has a rubber back, and the measurements are lined up in such a way that makes creating 90 degree angles easy. The middle has a slot that contains the picas and pixel measurements, and is designed so that most pen tips will fit inside. It\u2019s also constructed out of sturdy anodized aluminum, so that it won\u2019t be easily damaged by cutting. Backers get their choice of black or silver. \nMarklund says that they\u2019ve thought through their production process, and partnered with a specialty ruler manufacturer to construct their product, and that they\u2019re looking into a secondary supplier just in case. The fact that the ruler is a simple product, he explains, will make it easier for them to \u201cproduce the final rulers well within our timeframe.\u201d \nThe project has almost doubled its Kickstarter goal, and delivery is estimated for September 2017. \n"}
