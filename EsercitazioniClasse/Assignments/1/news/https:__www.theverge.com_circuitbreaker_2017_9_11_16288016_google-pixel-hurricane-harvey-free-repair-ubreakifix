{"title": "Google offers free repairs to Pixel owners affected by Hurricane Harvey", "content": " \nHurricane Harvey has been called an \u201cunprecedented\u201d storm, and in its wake companies have been stepping up to offer relief in a myriad of ways. Now, Google and phone repair company uBreakiFix have joined up to help as well.\nThe companies are offering free repairs on all Pixels at seven Houston area uBreakiFix locations until September 30th. uBreakiFix\u2019s blog post doesn\u2019t specify if water damage is covered, but that\u2019s likely a given. Google\u2019s flagship isn\u2019t quite as protected against water as other top smartphones on the market. Seeing as these phones are often a person\u2019s primary lifeline, it\u2019s a nice gesture from Google and uBreakiFix that will alleviate a little bit of worry for those recouping after Harvey.\nFree Pixel repairs will be available at the following uBreakiFix stores in Houston:\n\nThe Heights\nRice Village\nPearland\nPasadena\nWest Chase\nSugar Land\nWebster\n\n"}
