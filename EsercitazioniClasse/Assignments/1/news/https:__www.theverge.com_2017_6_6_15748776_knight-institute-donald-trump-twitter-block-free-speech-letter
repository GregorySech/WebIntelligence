{"title": "First Amendment group threatens to sue Trump for blocking Twitter users", "content": " \nA legal group has asked Donald Trump to unblock users who have offended him on Twitter, saying that the blocks violate the First Amendment. In a letter, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University argued that Trump\u2019s Twitter account was a public forum, and banning users from viewing or engaging with his tweets suppresses free speech. \u201cThe President must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable,\u201d writes Knight Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer. \u201cHaving opened this forum to all comers, the President can\u2019t exclude people from it merely because he dislikes what they\u2019re saying.\u201d\nThe Knight Institute letter cites the cases of Holly O\u2019Reilly and Joseph M. Papp, two Twitter users who were blocked from Trump\u2019s @RealDonaldTrump account after mocking or criticizing the president. They\u2019re far from the only people who have provoked the same reaction \u2014 others can be found in the #BlockedByTrump hashtag. Blocked users can\u2019t see Trump\u2019s tweets or reply to them while logged in, which the letter says \u201csuppresses speech in a number of ways.\u201d They compare the Twitter account to city council meeting or other public forum. \u201cIt is easy to understand why you and your advisers might have found our clients\u2019 posts to be disagreeable. Even if the posts were scornful and acerbic, however, they were protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\n\nThis is pretty much how the whole world sees you.#AMJoy#SundayMorning pic.twitter.com/CycqYnKg8b\u2014 Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 28, 2017\n\n\n\nTrump \u2014 like many Twitter users \u2014 has been blocking people for years, but the act took on new meaning after his election. The Knight Institute letter refers to both @RealDonaldTrump and the lesser-used @POTUS accounts, both of which serve as platforms for Trump to make official statements \u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer said today that Trump\u2019s tweets were \u201cofficial statements by the president of the United States.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy for users to log out and view the tweets, but can the president intentionally try to prevent someone from seeing public statements? This is untested legal territory, and a different (and weirder) question from the usual debates over Twitter free speech, which have previously covered account suspensions and shared blocklists. If the administration doesn\u2019t address the question, the Knight Institute says it should prepare to \u201cface legal action to protect the First Amendment rights of the blocked individuals.\u201d\n"}
