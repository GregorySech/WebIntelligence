{"title": "Show Notes: Today in random FCC drama!", "content": " \nBefore every episode of The Vergecast I sit down, read through a bunch of news, and take a bunch of notes. It\u2019s one of the most enjoyable parts of my week, and I started thinking it might be fun to do every day on the site. So, every day this week I\u2019m sitting down and writing some notes on the news as though I\u2019ll be talking about it later. Are you into this? Am I into this? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s fun to do! Give me some feedback and we\u2019ll keep mutating this into something good.\nSo, I\u2019m still figuring out when and how to prep this post on Thursdays, when we record The Vergecast and I have to do... the actual show notes. Would you prefer earlier or later? Let me know in the comments. Anyway, on with the... show... notes.\nBIG READS\n\nTake some time tonight or over the weekend to read Ben Popper\u2019s feature on Koko, a crowd- and AI-driven therapy network that runs through chat. And play with the interactive elements of the story, which were built by our data engineer Frank Bi. We haven\u2019t really talked about the ways technology can actually help people in a while, and adding a little more empathy to the world is a good start.\nLiz Lopatto and Alessandra Potenza wrote about why funding science research is so important: \u201cInvesting in research and development \u2014 that is, producing and funding scientists and engineers \u2014 has been one of the primary forces driving the US economy since World War II.\u201d They point out that companies like Google began with a National Science Foundation grant. Important context as the new administration works to cut back budgets for seemingly everything that isn\u2019t the military.\nI still haven\u2019t seen Get Out, but Jordan Peele\u2019s horror debut is at the top of the box office and getting rave reviews. Bryan Bishop interviewed Peele; dude is just as funny and interesting as you\u2019d expect.\nAnd Andrew Webster reviewed the new Zelda, which seems to have far surpassed anyone\u2019s expectations \n\nGOOGLING\n\nGoogle Assistant is coming to \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of devices running Android Marshmallow and Nougat today. It\u2019s happening through an update to Google Play Services, which is how Google bypasses carrier and manufacturer hurdles to update Android. \nAssistant is interesting, but this got me wondering: shouldn\u2019t Google consistently publicize how many devices are running the latest version of Play Services as well as the latest version of Android? That\u2019s actually the company\u2019s closest parallel to iOS adoption or whatever. Just a thought.\nGoogle also updated Allo to make it easier to call up Assistant in chats. This is great news for the four Allo users. Wait, the two Allo users who don\u2019t mind opening up their private chats to a giant corporation that can be subpoenaed for that data in the current political climate. Wait, zero Allo users.\n\nTODAY IN RANDOM FCC DRAMA\n\nTrump pulled Obama\u2019s final FCC nominee, which means the FCC is operating with just three commissioners right now instead of the usual five. (There\u2019s still another Republican nominee outstanding as well.) This wouldn\u2019t normally be a thing, but Chairman Pai needs at least three votes to pass anything, and right now there are two Republicans and one Democrat at the agency. \nThe FCC is supposed to only have a maximum of three commissioners from the party in power and two from another party, and the President traditionally defers to the other party\u2019s choice for those positions. (Obama nominated the Republicans\u2019 choice of Pai, for example.) But Trump could do something crazy and pick a Democrat himself, or pick an independent. So this move could really shape the agency\u2019s future decisions.\nWhat\u2019s particularly... something is that Jessica Rosenworcel, the pulled Democratic nominee, has been an excellent and even-handed commissioner thus far. She broke with former chairman Tom Wheeler on some of his proposals, and if the Republicans were looking for someone from the other party to do a good job filling the seat, it\u2019s not like they can do too much better.\nChairman Pai also published a Medium post about his upcoming agenda for the FCC\u2019s monthly open meeting today, which he\u2019s pledged to make more open and transparent. Good for him. His highest-priority item on the list? Stopping robocalls. Buried at the bottom? Deregulating mobile carriers a little bit more.\n\nOBLIGATORY SNAP IPO BULLET\n\nIt happened and Evan Spiegel is really rich now. I really could not care less, unless all that new money is going to turn into really interesting new products.\nLIGHTNING ROUND\n\nAmazon AWS went down because of a typo in a routine command. Every moment of every day is a tenuous walk on the edge of a cliff.\nAlso in Amazon: the company is working on a home security camera, which leaked out because... images of it are already up on Amazon.com. I currently use a cheap Logi Circle camera, but I\u2019m not paying the monthly cloud video storage fee. If Amazon bundles that into Prime, it\u2019s an instant-switch for me, I think.\nI was pretty excited about the Navdy, a $599 heads-up display that can be added to any car. It interfaces with a phone, does navigation, etc. But Dan Seifert reviewed the Navdy, and it sucks. Like, a lot. Guess we\u2019re still waiting on something good to happen in car tech.\nIs anyone surprised that the Apple whisper mill is pushing back against the rumor the next iPhone will drop Lightning for USB-C? The latest word is that, as expected, the switch to USB-C will be at the other end of the included cable, and Lightning will still be on the phone. Duh.\nThere\u2019s a real argument to be made that USB-A has become a de facto worldwide de facto power outlet standard, however. A-to-C and A-to-Lightning cables are going to be a fact of life for a long time to come.\nThe new Vizio E-Series starts at $550 for a 55-inch set with local dimming and HDR10 support. I reallllly should have bought one of these instead of that awful curved Samsung Becky hates so much.\nSpeaking of Becky, her law office is migrating to Office 365 right now and she... kind of hates it. I\u2019m trying to get her to write about it. Stay tuned.\nKaitlyn Tiffany and Lizzie Plaugic picked their music video of the week: Lorde\u2019s \u201cGreen Light.\u201d I mostly mention this because their tweet was \u201cEmergency: Lorde is back,\u201d and that is perfect.\nAnd finally, here is Kaitlyn having the only rational response to the new Pirates of the Caribbean trailer.\n\n"}
