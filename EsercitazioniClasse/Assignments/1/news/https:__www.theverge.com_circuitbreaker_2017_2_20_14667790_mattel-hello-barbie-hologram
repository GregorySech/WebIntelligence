{"title": "Hello Barbie Hologram is like Alexa but also an eternal prison", "content": " \nMattel\u2019s Hello Barbie line is the company\u2019s techiest endeavor. So far, the product suite consists of Hello Barbie herself, the smart Hello Barbie Dreamhouse, and now, Hello Barbie Hologram. Hello Barbie Hologram is designed to sit on a kid\u2019s nightstand or around the house to extend playtime. Mattel introduced it at the New York City Toy Fair this past weekend. The idea is that kids want to know what Barbie is up to when she isn\u2019t actively being played with, and the Hologram answers that question. (Spoiler alert: Barbie loves to dance.)\nHello Barbie Hologram doesn\u2019t really do much other than look cool and accept a few voice commands. Kids can talk to her and ask her to set a reminder, like remind me tomorrow that it\u2019s mom\u2019s birthday, ask her to have a dance party, or change outfits / her complete appearance. The box also acts as a nightlight. But Barbie can\u2019t conduct open web searches. She\u2019s no Alexa. Really, Barbie is just a prisoner trapped in a box who dances for kids on demand.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ashley Carman / The Verge\n\n\nThe tech inside is simple. There\u2019s a screen on top of the box playing Barbie content onto an angled mirror below that creates a 3D-looking object. (This is also called the Pepper\u2019s Ghost illusion.) \nUltimately, Hello Barbie Hologram is a fun gimmick that at least looks pretty, and I\u2019m sure will blow kids\u2019 minds. Although I don\u2019t know, maybe this upcoming generation has really seen it all on YouTube. Hello Barbie Hologram will available in the fall with pricing still to be determined, although Mattel aims to have it cost less than $300.\n"}
