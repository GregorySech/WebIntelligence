{"title": "Say \u2018Wish you were here\u2019 with these postcards of hellish deep-sea creatures", "content": " \nThe bottom of the ocean is teeming with weird animals \u2014 and this week, they\u2019re being featured in a cute postcard created by the National Centers for Environmental Information. The postcard is part of new twice-monthly series of images taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s vast photo collection and paired with scientific descriptions. \nThis week, the postcard stars the photogenic, bottom-dwelling sea creatures that make up the broad category of benthic animals or benthos\u2014 like sponges, starfish, and scallops. They\u2019re as diverse as the varied underwater habitats they live in. But most of these invertebrates are similar in that they survive by filtering through the muck that drifts to the ocean floor. They basically act like the ocean\u2019s garbage disposal, churning up the sediment and cycling nutrients in the meantime. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoantharia (Bullagummizoanthus emilyacadiaarum\t\t\nPhoto by NOAA Ocean Exploration and Research\n\n\nA few benthic animals live really, really deep underwater, like these lobsters that shack up next to hydrothermal vents nearly four miles beneath the surface. \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of 13 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of each other,\u201d NOAA writes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSquat lobster (Munidopsis subsquamosa)\n\nPhoto by NOAA\n\n\nTo withstand the high pressures and cold temperatures of the deep ocean, many benthic animals puff themselves up with water and slow down their metabolisms. But humans are less well-adapted to the intense pressures. So to snap these photos, people working with NOAA sent down the Deep Discoverer remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which can dive up to four miles down. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew species discovered by the Deep Discoverer ROV during a 2015 dive.

Now, we can look at these gorgeous photos and even send them as birthday cards to mom. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnelid (worm)\nImage by NOAA\n\n\n"}
